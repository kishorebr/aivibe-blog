# Deployment Guide for AI & Automation Blog

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your AI & Automation blog to Vercel for free hosting.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A Vercel account (you can sign up for free using your GitHub account)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize Git in your project folder (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kishorekumarbr/Downloads/AI/ai-automation-blog
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
3. Add your GitHub repository as a remote and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-automation-blog.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: npm run prepare-deploy
   - Output Directory: .next
5. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your blog. Once completed, you'll receive a URL where your blog is accessible.

### 3. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to configure DNS settings

### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated Content Updates

The GitHub Actions workflow is already configured in your repository. It will run daily to fetch and process new content.

To manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions"
3. Select the "Daily Content Update" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Analytics**: Consider adding Google Analytics or Plausible Analytics to track visitor data
- **Performance**: Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to monitor performance
- **Content**: Regularly check that the automated content updates are working correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with deployment:

1. Check the build logs in Vercel for errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify that the sample content generation is working properly
4. Check that your environment variables are correctly set in Vercel

## Next Steps for Optimization

1. Implement image optimization for better performance
2. Add more RSS feeds to diversify content sources
3. Implement a more sophisticated content filtering algorithm
4. Add social sharing functionality
5. Implement comments using a service like Disqus
