    OpenAI wins gold at prestigious math competition - why that matters more than you think
     
    The company's experimental reasoning model wasn't fine-tuned to solve math problems, but was trained as a general problem-solver.

            Webb Wright, Contributing WriterContributing Writer  July 21, 2025 at 10:34 a.m. PT                           OpenAIOpenAI has achieved a new milestone in the race to build AI models that can reason their way through complex math problems.On Saturday, the companyÂ announcedÂ that one of its models achieved gold medal-level performance on the International Math Olympiad (IMO), widely regarded as the most prestigious and difficult math competition in the world.Â We achieved gold medal-level performance ðŸ¥‡on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad with a general-purpose reasoning LLM!Our model solved world-class math problemsâ€”at the level of top human contestants. A major milestone for AI and mathematics. https://t.co/u2RlFFavyTâ€” OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 19, 2025

Critically, the winning model wasn't designed specifically to solve IMO problems, in the way that earlier systems like DeepMind's AlphaGo -- which famously beat the world's leading Go player in 2016 -- were trained on a massive dataset within a very narrow, task-specific domain. Rather, the winner was a general-purpose reasoning model, designed to think through problems methodically using natural language.Also: Is ChatGPT down? You're not alone. Here's what OpenAI is saying"This is an LLM doing math and not a specific formal math system," OpenAI wrote in its X post. "It's part of our main push towards general intelligence."(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems. Ziffâ€¯Davis also owns DownDetector.)Â Â Not much is known at this p
