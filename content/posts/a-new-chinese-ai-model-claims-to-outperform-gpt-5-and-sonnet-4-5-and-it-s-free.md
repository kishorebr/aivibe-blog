Kimi K2 Thinking also showed coding abilities that were comparable to GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, but not notably more impressive.     Credit: Moonshot "By reasoning while actively using a diverse set of tools, K2 Thinking is capable of planning, reasoning, executing, and adapting across hundreds of steps to tackle some of the most challenging academic and analytical problems," Moonshot wrote on its website.What Kimi K2 offersKimi K2 Thinking is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model blending long-horizon planning, adaptive reasoning, and the use of online tools (such as browsers), "continually generating and refining hypotheses, verifying evidence, reasoning, and constructing coherent answers," the company wrote. "This interleaved reasoning allows i
