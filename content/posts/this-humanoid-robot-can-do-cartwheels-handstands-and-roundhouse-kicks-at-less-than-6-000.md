<p>For less than the price of a fully decked-out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-latest-macbook-pro-beats-my-high-end-pc-for-content-creation-130053351.html">MacBook Pro</a>, you can buy Unitree&#39;s latest humanoid robot called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.unitree.com/R1">R1</a>. You only have to shell out $5,900 for a robot that weighs around 55 lbs, stands about four feet tall, and is built with a Large Multimodal Model to handle complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#39;re wondering what the R1 will be used for, your guess is as good as ours. Unitree said its robot is &quot;fully customizable&quot; and demoed its capabilities in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/UnitreeRobotics/status/1948681325277577551">video</a> showing off cartwheels, handstands, boxing, roundhouse kicks and running downhill, but didn&#39;t offer examples with any practical use yet. The lightweight robot has an ultra-wide view and a four-microphone array to help it recognize voices and images, but was also built with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. It&#39;s not hard to envision a world where people program the R1 as a robot butler to handle daily chores, much like what <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-reportedly-working-on-humanoid-robots-that-help-with-chores-192453416.html">Meta</a> is reportedly working on. However, you might even be able to square up two R1s to fight each other, as evidenced by Unitree promoting a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/UnitreeRobotics/status/1928101663900062148">unique fighting tournament</a> that felt like a less aesthetically polished version of 2011&#39;s <em>Real Steel</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest R1 is a much lower entry point than Unitree&#39;s previous humanoid robot, the G1, which starts at $16,000 and was demoed at <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2025-the-good-the-bad-and-the-completely-unhinged-174529774.html">CES 2025</a> with somewhat disastrous results. Even though the R1&#39;s sub-$6,000 price tag is arguably high, it&#39;s still much cheaper compared to other similar options, like Tesla&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-head-of-teslas-optimus-humanoid-robot-program-leaves-the-company-120015282.html">Optimus bot</a> that&#39;s expected to go for at least $20,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/this-humanoid-robot-can-do-cartwheels-handstands-and-roundhouse-kicks-at-less-than-6000-184500276.html?src=rss
