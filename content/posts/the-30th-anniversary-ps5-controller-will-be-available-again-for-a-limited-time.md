<p>In a world of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-will-have-gorgeous-playstation-5-bundles-for-ghost-of-yotei-225956104.html">flashy limited-edition video game consoles</a>, the 30th anniversary PS5 hardware Sony <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstations-30th-anniversary-ps5-and-ps5-pro-consoles-are-so-very-pretty-170713396.html">released in September 2024</a> came off as remarkably refined, which might have been why it was so hard to actually buy. If you missed that original drop, you'll have another chance to order it, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/playstation/posts/pfbid02er4daJ2JHAvATGg7rxwedRkp22CQQQRw3oNCyRa42oFVwhnGz8wsmZSzWj1GhBnNl">a Facebook post</a> on the official PlayStation Facebook page. Sony is doing a limited restock of the 30th Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense controller on September 5, and you'll be able to preorder one for yourself next week.</p>
<p>Preorders start on July 21 at 10AM ET / 7AM PT for PlayStation Plus subscribers and July 23 at 10AM ET / 7AM PT for the general public. The controller will have to be ordered directly through the PlayStation Store â€” Sony hasn't said if the restock will extend to other online marketplaces like Amazon or Best Buy. Based on what the company has shared, only the DualSense controller will be restocked in the US, but the PlayStation Store in the UK and Canada will also have restocks of the 30th Anniversary Limited Edition PlayStation 5 Console and the PS Portal, as well.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony's 30th Anniversary Limited Edition hardware features the classic PS1 gray, with touches of color to represent the formerly cheery PlayStation logo and face buttons. On the DualSense in particular, the old-school red, green, yellow and blue PlayStation logo replaces the typical black one found on other PS5 controllers.</p>
<p>Limiting one round of preorders to PS Plus subscribers should hopefully make it easier to purchase the DualSense, something Sony didn't bother to do when it first dropped the limited edition hardware last year. Managing online sales and avoiding scalpers has prompted some interesting strategies as of late. With the launch of the Switch 2, for example, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-prioritizing-switch-online-subscribers-in-its-switch-2-pre-orders-171645498.html">Nintendo limited preorders</a> of its new console to customers with a Nintendo Online account that was at least 12 months old and had at least 50 hours of total playtime logged.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-30th-anniversary-ps5-controller-will-be-available-again-for-a-limited-time-195731358.html?src=rss
