<p>Game Science Studio isn&#39;t resting on its laurels after the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/black-myth-wukong-breaks-steams-concurrent-single-player-record-within-hours-of-launch-184559634.html">success</a> of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. The developer teased a follow-up project as the closer to Gamescom&#39;s Opening Night Live showcase with a brief but beautifully detailed glimpse at <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no date attached to the cinematic teaser, and that&#39;s because the game is still very much a work in progress. According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui/"><ins>FAQ</ins></a> entry about a possible release window, the team says &quot;Well, to be honestâ€”even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea&quot; when it&#39;ll be ready. But the same page does confirm that the plan is for <em>Zhong Kui </em>to launch on both PC and &quot;all mainstream console platforms&quot; whenever it is done.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From the title and the previous <em>Black Myth</em> game, this new project will once again be drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology. Legends around <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Kui"><ins>Zhong Kui</ins></a> dub him a conqueror of ghosts and evil spirits, so perhaps there will be some supernatural vibes in this entry to the emerging game series. Pretty much the only other thing we know besides the name and character is that <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em> will once again be a single-player ARPG and it will be &quot;following the same business model as before.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-zhong-kui-next-221537956.html?src=rss
