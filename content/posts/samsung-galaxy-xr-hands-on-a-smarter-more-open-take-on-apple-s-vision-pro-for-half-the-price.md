<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Vision Pro</a> was meant to usher in a new era for headsets. However, its high price and somewhat limited utility resulted in what may be the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://macdailynews.com/2025/03/10/the-apple-vision-pro-is-clearly-a-commercial-flop/">biggest</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/revisiting-the-three-biggest-flops-of-2024/">flop</a> in years. Now it&#39;s time for Samsung to give things a go with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR</a>. It&#39;s a fresh take on modern mixed reality goggles developed through deep partnerships with Qualcomm and Google and it attempts to address some of the Vision Pro&#39;s biggest shortcomings.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<div id="2d21abadac6841fbb681e3c699ef3e7c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJkbTave_I8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>While both Apple and Samsung&#39;s headsets have a lot of similarities (like their basic design and support for features such as hand and eye tracking), there are also some very important differences. First, at $1,800, the Galaxy XR is essentially half the price of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Vision Pro</a> (including the new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">M5-powered model</a>). Second, instead of Appleâ€™s homegrown OS, Samsung&#39;s headset is the first to run Google&#39;s new Android XR platform, which combines a lot of familiar elements from its mobile counterpart but with a bigger emphasis on AI and Gemini-based voice controls. And third, because Samsung relied more on partners like Google and Qualcomm, the Galaxy XR feels like it&#39;s built around a larger, more open ecosystem that plays nicely with a wider range of third-party devices and software.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy XR fundamentally doesn&#39;t look that much different from the Vision Pro. It features a large visor in front with an assortment of 13 different exterior sensors to support inside-out tracking, passthrough vision and hand recognition. There are some additional sensors inside for eye and face tracking. There&#39;s also a connector for the wire that leads to its external clip-on battery pack alongside built-in speakers with spatial audio. The one big departure is that unlike the Vision Pro, the Galaxy XR doesn&#39;t have an outward-facing display, so it won&#39;t be able to project your face onto the outside of the headset, which is just fine by me.</p>

<p>However, the devil is in the details because while the original Vision Pro weighed between 600 and 650 grams (around 1.3 to 1.4 pounds) depending on the configuration (not including its battery pack), the Galaxy XR is significantly lighter at 545 grams (1.2 pounds). And that&#39;s before you consider the new M5 Vision Pro, which has somehow gone backwards by being even heavier at 750-800 grams (around 1.6 pounds). Furthermore, it seems Samsung learned a lot from its rivals by including a much larger and thicker head cushion that helps distribute the weight of the headset more evenly. Granted, during a longer session, I still noticed a bit of pressure and felt relief after taking off the Galaxy XR, but it&#39;s nothing like the Vision Pro, which in my experience gets uncomfortable almost immediately. Finally, around back, there&#39;s a simple strap with a knob that you can twist to tighten or loosen the headband as necessary. So even without extra support running across the top of your head, getting in and out of the Galaxy XR is much easier and comfier than the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>On the inside, the Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip with dual micro OLED displays that deliver 4K resolution (3,552 x 3,840) to each eye at up to 90Hz. I wish Samsung was able to go up to a 120Hz refresh rate like on the Vision Pro, but considering the Galaxy XR&#39;s slightly higher overall resolution, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bothered. And I must say, the image quality from this headset is seriously sharp. It&#39;s even better than Apple&#39;s goggles and it might be the best I&#39;ve ever used, particularly outside of $10,000+ enterprise-only setups. Once again, when you consider that this thing costs half the price of a Vision Pro, this headset feels like a real accomplishment by Samsung to the point where I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the company is losing money on every unit it sells.</p>
<p>In terms of longevity, Samsung says that for general use the Galaxy XR should last around two hours. If you&#39;re only watching videos though, that figure is more like two and a half. Thankfully, if you do need to be in mixed reality for longer, you can charge the headset while it&#39;s being used. As for security, the Galaxy XR uses iris recognition to skip traditional passwords, which is nice.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-platform-android-xr">The platform: Android XR</h2>
<p>Sometimes, trying out a new software platform can be a little jarring. But that&#39;s not really the case for Android XR, which shouldn&#39;t present much of a learning curve for anyone who has used other headsets or Google&#39;s ubiquitous mobile OS. After putting the goggles on, you can summon a home menu with an app launcher by facing your palm up and touching your index finger and thumb together. From there, you can open apps and menus by moving your hands and pinching icons or rearranging virtual windows by grabbing the anchor point along the bottom and putting them where you want.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Even without a top strap, the Galaxy XR is surprisingly comfortable thanks to a larger forehead cushion and less weight than the Apple Vision Pro.

<p>Notably, while there is a growing number of new apps made specifically for XR, you still get access to all of your standard Android titles. Those include Google Photos, Google Maps and Youtube, all of which I got a chance to play around with during a 25-minute demo. In Photos, you can browse your pictures normally. However, to take advantage of the Galaxy XR&#39;s hardware, Google created a feature that allows the app to convert standard flat images (with help from the cloud) into immersive ones. While the effect isn&#39;t true 3D, it adds distinct foreground, midground and background layers to images in a way that makes viewing your photo roll just a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>In Maps, you start out with a view of the world before using hand gestures to move and zoom in wherever you want or voice commands to laser in on a specific location. The neat new trick for this app is that if you find bubbles over things like restaurants and stores, you can click those to be transported inside those businesses, where Android XR will stitch together 2D photos to create a simulated 3D environment that you can move and walk around in. Granted, this doesn&#39;t have a ton of practical use for most folks unless you want to take a virtual tour of something like a wedding venue. But, the tech is impressive nonetheless.</p>

Runtime is expected to be about two hours, or two and a half if you are only watching videos.

<p>Finally in the YouTube app, the Galaxy XR did a great job of making standard 360 videos look even better. While quality will always depend on the gear that captured the content, viewing spatial clips was a great way to show off its resolution and image quality. Google says it will also put a new tab on the app to make finding 360 videos easier, though you can always watch the billions of standard flat videos as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can use and navigate the Galaxy XR entirely with hand gestures, but voice commands (via Gemini) are also a major part of the Android XR platform. Because the goggles sit on your head, unlike with mobile devices, there&#39;s no need to use a wake word every time you want to do something. You just talk and Gemini listens (though you can choose to disable this behavior if you prefer), so this makes voice interactions feel a lot more natural. Because Gemini can also do things like adjust settings or organize all the apps you have open, in addition to answering questions, it feels like Google is starting to deliver on some of those Star Trek moments where you can simply ask the computer to do something and it just happens. Yes, it&#39;s still very early, but as a platform, Android XR feels much more like a virtual playground than VisionOS does at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-features">Other features</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4b701ee0-aeb8-11f0-b5ee-e4c5740e114c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4b701ee0-aeb8-11f0-b5ee-e4c5740e114c" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset has a handy knob for quickly loosening or tightening its headband." data-uuid="88e959cc-83ea-3368-a458-88c518245aca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>While I didn&#39;t get to test these out myself, there are some other important features worth mentioning. In addition to apps, you can also play your standard selection of Android games like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or connect the headset to your PC (like with Steam Link) to play full desktop titles. Furthermore, I was told that the Galaxy XR can be tethered to a computer and used like a traditional VR headset. And while Samsung is making optional wireless controllers for the Galaxy XR (and a big carrying case), you may not need them at all as you&#39;ll also have the ability to pair the goggles with typical Bluetooth-based gamepads along with wireless mice and keyboards.</p>
<p>Google also says it&#39;s working on a new system called Likenesses that can create personalized avatars for use in video calls and meetings that use data from interior sensors to deliver more realistic expressions. Additionally, you&#39;ll be able to use tools like Veo3 to make AI-generated videos while providing prompts using your voice. But this is just scratching the surface of the Galaxy XR&#39;s capabilities and I want to use this thing more before offering a final verdict.</p>

<p>In many ways, the Galaxy XR looks and feels like a flagship mixed reality headset in the same vein as the Vision Pro, but for the Android crowd (and Windows users to some extent as well). On top of that, Google has done some interesting things with Android XR to make it feel like there&#39;s a much wider range of content and software to view and use. In many ways, the addition of a dedicated AI assistant in Gemini and voice controls feels much more impactful on goggles than a phone because you can&#39;t always count on having physical inputs like a mouse or keyboard. And with the Galaxy XR being half the price of the Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have done a lot to address some of the most glaring issues with Apple&#39;s rival.</p>
<p>In case the price drop wasn&#39;t enough, it feels like all the companies involved are doing as much as possible to sweeten the deal. I actually started laughing when I first heard all the discounts and free subscriptions that come with the headset. That&#39;s because in addition to the goggles themselves, every Galaxy XR will come with what&#39;s being called the Explorer Pack: 12 months of access to Google AI Pro, 12 months of YouTube Premium (which itself includes YouTube Music), 12 months of Google Play Pass, 12 Months of NBA League Pass and a bundle of other custom XR content and apps. So on top of a slick design, top-tier optics and a new platform, Google and Samsung are basically tossing a kitchen sink of apps and memberships in with the headset.</p>

<p>My only reservation is that when it comes to mass adoption, I think smartglasses have supplanted headsets as the next big mainstream play. Granted, there is a lot of technology and software shared between both categories of devices (Google has already teased upcoming Android XR smartglasses) that should allow Samsung or Google to pivot more easily down the line. But the idea that in the future there will be a headset in every home seems less likely every day. Still, as a showcase for the potential of mixed reality and high-end optics, the Galaxy XR is an exciting piece of tech.</p>
