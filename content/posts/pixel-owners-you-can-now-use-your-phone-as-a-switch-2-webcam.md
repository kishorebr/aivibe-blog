<p>The Switch 2&#39;s lack of a built-in camera means you need an external one for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/gamechat-is-decades-late-and-looks-pretty-janky-202309823.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">GameChat video calls</a>. But now, if your phone is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Google Pixel</a>, you don&#39;t even need one of those. <em>Android Authority</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phone-as-switch-2-webcam-3622443/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reported</a> on Friday that the two now work nicely together (without needing third-party apps), and our tests confirm that.</p><p>Google has technically supported the use of Android devices as external webcams for two years: The company added it in a quarterly update for Android 14. (Specifically, it added the ability for devices to use USB Video Class mode, or UVC.) But that functionality didn&#39;t work with the Switch 2 before the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/remix-in-google-messages-brings-ai-photo-editing-to-even-more-phones-190000445.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">November Pixel Drop</a>.</p><p>How do we know it was that version? Well, before our Editor-in-Chief, Aaron Souppouris, installed November’s update on a Pixel, the Switch 2 webcam feature didn&#39;t work. After updating to that one today (but before installing the December update), it worked.</p><p>If that wasn&#39;t enough, the November firmware&#39;s release <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/386109819" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">notes</a> listed a &quot;fix for an issue where webcam mode does not work properly with connected devices under certain conditions.&quot; That pretty much cinches it. Regardless, we reached out to Google for official confirmation, and we&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pixel-owners-you-can-now-use-your-phone-as-a-switch-2-webcam-203407555.html?src=rss
