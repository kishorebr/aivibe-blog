<p>Hideo Kojima doesn't really go for half measures. Following a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/death-stranding-2-just-got-its-release-date-and-a-10-minute-new-trailer-231240932.html"><ins>10-minute trailer</ins></a> that unveiled some early details, the game creator participated in a beefy 80-minute panel discussion with Geoff Keighley about <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> on the final day of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-new-at-summer-game-fest-2025-xbox-handheld-resident-evil-requiem-and-more-185425578.html">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging conversation included some clips from the sequel to the acclaimed <em>Death Stranding</em>, including its first five minutes, which sparked lots of cheers as people recognized performers' names in the opening credits. Kojima also showed the English language version of a scene that was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show, highlighting the performances of Elle Fanning as Tomorrow and Shioli Kutsuna as Rainy. Fans also got a chance to see Tomorrow in action as she literally gets down and dirty in the tar to take out some robotic combatants. There was also a live gameplay demo, first showing Sam in combat with a blood boomerang and a tar cannon, then a more challenging fight against Neil that showed off some stealth attacks as well as some more weaponry.</p>
