<p>With the launch of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-will-be-released-during-the-2025-holiday-season-142135533.html">ROG Xbox Ally</a> only a few weeks away <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-handhelds-will-be-available-october-16-but-we-still-dont-know-the-price-134015698.html">on October 16</a>, the fantasy of a portable Xbox is about to be a lot more real. As <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3OK9A_RbSI">a recent video</a> from YouTuber James Channel shows, though, with a first-generation Xbox and the right components, you can make your own version of an Xbox handheld right now. Just don&#39;t expect it to be pretty.</p>
<p>James&#39; &quot;portable monstrosity&quot; strips away the original Xbox&#39;s large plastic casing and thick internal cables and preserves the bare essentials: a motherboard and the console&#39;s disk drive, with a new flash drive and a display from an iPod video accessory. All those components are precariously mounted between the left and right halves of an Xbox controller, for a complete package that seems less easy to hold than ASUS&#39; current handheld PCs, but only marginally so. It&#39;s a quick and dirty assembly with a surprising amount of super glue — a far cry from the polished <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-2dgSjljn4">Xbox 360 handheld</a> created by YouTuber Millomaker — but it gets the job done.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can already stream Xbox games to a multitude of screens, or play their PC versions on a growing number of handheld PCs. You don&#39;t need to turn an original Xbox into a portable device, but considering Microsoft and ASUS have yet to announce pricing for their new handhelds, maybe keep this cheaper alternative in your back pocket.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/theres-more-than-one-way-to-make-an-xbox-handheld-201503415.html?src=rss
