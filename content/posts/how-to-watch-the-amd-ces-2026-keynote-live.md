The company will outline the full scope of its vision for AI implementations from across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise applications. The presentation — which is the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/dr-lisa-su-chair-and-ceo-of-amd-to-keynote-ces-2026-on-how-ai-is-changing-the-world-302550208.html"><ins>lead keynote</ins></a> for CES 2026 — will be led by CEO Dr. Lisa Su.</p>

<p>Dr. Su will deliver a keynote speech from the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian on Monday, January 5 at 9:30PM ET (6:30PM PT). You can watch the event live on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvBNWbFK2lY"><ins>CES YouTube channel</ins></a> (we&#39;ve embedded the livestream below).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html"><ins>under wraps</ins></a>, we can expect &quot;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &quot;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&quot; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever"><ins>better single-threaded performance</ins></a>. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html"><ins>FSR Redstone</ins></a> technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD&#39;s upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025.</p>
<p>Su&#39;s presentation caps off CES&#39;s press day, so she&#39;ll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130028668.html"><ins>NVIDIA</ins></a> and Intel present their chipmaking and AI bona plans to the world.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-amd-ces-2026-keynote-live-190012078.html?src=rss
