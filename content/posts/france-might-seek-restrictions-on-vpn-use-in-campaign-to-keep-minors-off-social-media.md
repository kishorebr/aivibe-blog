<p>France may take additional steps to prevent minors from accessing social media platforms. As its government advances a proposed ban on social media use for anyone under age 15, some leaders are already looking to add further restrictions. During an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VfMKmeHnrM" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">appearance</a> on public broadcast service Franceinfo, Minister Delegate for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Affairs Anne Le Hénanff said <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">VPNs</a> might be the next target.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;If [this legislation] allows us to protect a very large majority of children, we will continue. And VPNs are the next topic on my list,&quot; she <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpns-are-next-on-my-list-france-set-to-evaluate-vpn-use-following-social-media-ban-for-under-15s" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">said</a>.</p><p>A virtual private network would potentially allow French citizens younger than 15 to circumnavigate the social media ban. We&#39;ve already seen VPN&#39;s experience <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a popularity spike in the UK</a> last year after similar laws were passed over age-gating content. However, a VPN also offers benefits for online privacy, and introducing age verification requirements where your personal data must be submitted negates a large part of these services&#39; appeal.&nbsp;</p><p>The French social media ban is still a work in progress. France&#39;s National Assembly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/frances-national-assembly-debates-banning-under-15s-social-media-2026-01-26/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">voted in favor</a> of the restrictions last week with a result of 116-23, moving it ahead for discussion in the country&#39;s Senate. While a single comment doesn&#39;t mean that France will in fact ban VPNs for any demographic, it does point to the direction some of the country&#39;s leaders want to take. Critics responded to Le Hénanff&#39;s statements with worry that these attempts at protective measures were veering into an authoritarian direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The actions in France echo several other legislative pushes around the world aimed at reducing children and teens&#39; access to social media and other potentially sensitive content online. The US had seen <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">25 state-level laws</a> for age verification introduced in the past two years, which has created a new set of concerns around users&#39; privacy and personal data, particularly when there has been no attempt to standardize how that information will be collected or protected. When data breaches at large corporations are already all too common, it&#39;s hard to trust that the individual sites and services that suddenly need to build an age verification process won&#39;t be an easy target for hacks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/france-might-seek-restrictions-on-vpn-use-in-campaign-to-keep-minors-off-social-media-205308716.html?src=rss
