<p>Every fall, dozens of maple and oak trees in my neighborhood shed their leaves. Thus begins the constant drone of gas-powered leaf blowers every day through early December. The noise is by far the most annoying thing about these yard tools, but I can appreciate it’s a necessary evil — unless you prefer to pick up a blister-inducing rake. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.whisper.aero/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Whisper Aero</a> argues there’s a better way. The company is using aerospace tech to quiet the noisy devices, introducing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://toneoutdoors.com/products/t1" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the T1</a> leaf blower <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">at CES 2026</a> under its sub-brand Tone Outdoors. The company promises the T1 is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading” handheld gas leaf blowers. More specifically, the T1 has 880 CFM of air flow, which easily surpasses my battery-powered EGO. And at 52 decibels of average noise at peak volume, his model is drastically quieter than any leaf blower I’ve used. I was able to confirm its lower roar on the CES show floor. </p>
<p>Tone says the T1 also offers extended run time of up to 50 minutes on a charge in Eco mode. That too is greater than what I get on my mid-grade EGO. What’s more, the company plans to sell a battery backpack that will extend any clean-up sessions for several hours. The T1 also has a built-in LED “nightlight” so you can still use it after dark. And since it’s quieter than what you have now, you can do so without annoying your neighbors.</p>

<p>So, how does Whisper Aero achieve this? The company originally set out to devise a quieter solution for electric aerospace motors. Its engineers discovered that they could dramatically reduce noise and increase overall efficiency by redesigning the fan and motor. They&#39;re still pursuing that, but the company discovered its technology had other uses too.</p>
<p>The T1 is already available for preorder for $599 and it’s scheduled to ship in September. If you don’t care for the standard green color, you can spend another $100 for limited edition “Silence Is Golden” version. The battery backpack won’t arrive until Q1 2027 though (price TBD). Tone also says it has additional models in the works and it has a partnership with Stanley Black and Decker that will likely produce additional products with this tech on board. </p>
