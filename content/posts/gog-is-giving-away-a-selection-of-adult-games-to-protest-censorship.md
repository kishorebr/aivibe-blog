<p>In partnership with developers, game marketplace GOG (Good Old Games) has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gog.com/pressroom/gog-and-game-publishers-launch-freedomtobuy-games-to-raise-awareness-on-censorship-in-gaming/">launched a new website</a> called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomtoBuy.games</a> that&#39;ll let you download select &quot;adult&quot; games for free. GOG believes the website takes a stand &quot;against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves,&quot; a response of sorts to recent decisions from Steam and Itch to delist certain violent and sexuality-explicit games from their respective platforms.</p>
<p>GOG is currently offering 13 games for free for the next 48 hours, some with well-known scandals and others that seem to fall into the &quot;NSFW visual novel&quot; bucket that makes up the majority of sexually-explicit games on digital storefronts. The titles available to download are:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ul>
<li><p><em>Leap of Love</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Being a DIK — Season 1</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Leap of Faith</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>POSTAL 2</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>House Party</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>HuniePop</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Lust Theory</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Agony + Agony Unrated</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Treasure of Nadia</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Summer&#39;s Gone — Season 1</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Fetish Locator Week One</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Helping the Hotties</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Sapphire Safari</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>POSTAL 2, a </em>graphically violent open-world game, is a notable inclusion because it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news301104postal2nz">banned in New Zealand</a> in 2004 and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.neowin.net/news/27-games-get-pulled-from-steam-in-germany-likely-for-being-controversial/">delisted from the German version of Steam</a> in 2016. <em>HuniePop, </em>one of several &quot;adult-only&quot; games Twitch streamers are <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/list-of-prohibited-games?language=en_US">explicitly forbidden to stream</a>, makes sense on the list, too. GOG has made a concerted effort to preserve games of all types, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-lays-out-the-business-case-for-robust-game-preservation">maintaining them</a> so that they run on current hardware. The point of making these games available to download is as much about preservation as it is about highlighting how apparently easy it is to pressure digital storefronts to remove content, though.</p>
<p>Valve&#39;s decision to delist titles from Steam was chalked up to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html">a new rule</a> that requires games to abide by the standards set by the payment processors that work with Steam. Itch offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html">a similar explanation</a> for the delistings on its storefront, pointing to pressure payment processors were receiving from a nonprofit called Collective Shout. In the process, indie games <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html">like <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> </a>have been delisted, primarily for depicting things that might make a certain group of people uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itch, for its part, seems to be trying to bring back as many games to its storefront as it can. The platform is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-starts-reindexing-free-nsfw-content-152431716.html">restoring free NSFW games</a>, and says it&#39;s still in talks with its payment partners about restoring paid games to its storefront.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gog-is-giving-away-a-selection-of-adult-games-to-protest-censorship-215048233.html?src=rss
