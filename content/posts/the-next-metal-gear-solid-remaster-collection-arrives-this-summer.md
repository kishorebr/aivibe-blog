<p>Volume two of the <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em> will arrive on August 27, publisher Konami <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-launches-aug-27-2026-on-ps5/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced today</a> during Sony’s latest State of Play presentation. The bundle will feature 2008’s <em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, </em>the HD remaster of 2010’s <em>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker </em>and a selection of bonus content, including <em>Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</em>, which was originally released for Game Boy Color in 2000. All told, that’s a smaller selection of games than Konami made available with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-heads-to-consoles-and-pc-on-october-24th-170009937.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Vol. 1</a> of the Master Collection, but Metal Gear fans will be excited nonetheless, if only for the fact it will mark the first time <em>MGS4</em> will be officially playable on a platform other than the PlayStation 3. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Le2VFSdYzPw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>That it has taken Konami nearly two decades to release the conclusion of Solid Snake’s story on more systems has to do with the nature of the game as a PS3 exclusive. <em>MGS4 </em>took extensive advantage of the console’s unique Cell architecture, a fact that made it difficult (and expensive) proposition to port to more recent x86-based systems. In recent years, it’s been possible to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHZeCjVGIY" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">emulate the game on a powerful PC</a>, but not everyone has that kind of hardware.    </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2  </em>will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Update, February 12, 6:30PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publish to add details about <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2</em>’s launch platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-next-metal-gear-solid-remaster-collection-arrives-this-summer-231711005.html?src=rss
