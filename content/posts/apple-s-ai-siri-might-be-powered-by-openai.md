<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple is considering enlisting the help of OpenAI or Anthropic to power its AI-upgraded Siri, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt">a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>. As Apple continues to struggle with the development of an upgraded “LLM Siri,” it reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to create versions of their large language models to test on the company’s private cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months, Apple has been working to get its AI-enhanced Siri back on track after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought">delaying the overhauled assistant’s launch</a> in March. Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633358/apple-replace-siri-leader-john-giannandrea">appointed Vision Pro head Mike Rockwell</a> as the leader of AI and Siri after CEO Tim Cook “lost confidence” in the team’s former chief, John Giannandrea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Rockwell asked his team to test whether Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or Google’s Gemini performs better at handling basic requests compared to its own models, with Anthropic’s apparently seen as the most promising. While Google has Gemini AI features for Android and its Pixel lineup, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/652746/google-samsung-gemini-default-placement-antitrust-trial">Samsung licenses Google’s AI model</a> for its phones. It is also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-01/samsung-nears-wide-ranging-deal-with-perplexity-for-ai-featurescheckout=true">reportedly</a> close to cutting a deal with Perplexity, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/656599/perplexitys-ceo-on-fighting-google-and-the-coming-ai-browser-war">already has a tie-up with Motorola</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/apple-executives-have-held-internal-talks-about-buying-ai-startup-perplexity"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported Apple executives had considered acquiring Perplexity to help boost its AI ambitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/682984/apple-punts-on-siri-updates-as-it-struggles-to-keep-up-in-the-ai-race">LLM Siri was largely absent</a> from Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month, where SVP of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685106/apple-ai-siri-delay-craig-federighi-greg-joswiak-wwdc-2025">admitted that the technology</a> “didn’t hit our quality standard.” <em>Bloomberg</em> notes that Apple’s plans to incorporate a third-party AI model into Siri are still at an “early stage” and that it’s still considering using in-house models.</p>
