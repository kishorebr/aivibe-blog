<p>Germany-based search engine and browser nonprofit <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ecosia.org">Ecosia</a> is the latest party to make an offer for Google&#39;s Chrome. Questions about Chrome&#39;s fate have been swirling since the news that the Department of Justice would push for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-still-have-to-break-up-its-business-the-justice-department-said-150000739.html"><ins>Google to sell the browser</ins></a> after the ruling that the company&#39;s search engine business constituted a monopoly. Although Google is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-plans-to-appeal-the-antitrust-ruling-against-its-search-engine-dominance-171748836.html"><ins>planning to appeal</ins></a> the decision, that hasn&#39;t stopped <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/openai-says-it-would-buy-chrome-if-google-is-forced-to-sell-215239832.html"><ins>other big tech businesses</ins></a> from pitching themselves as potential owners of Chrome.</p>
<p>Ecosia&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/ecosia-has-offered-to-take-stewardship-of-chrome-and-its-not-a-bad-idea/">proposal</a> is different. Rather than selling off the valuable browser for an upfront windfall, this plan would see Google transforming Chrome into a foundation. Ecosia would assume operational responsibility for the browser for ten years, but Google would retain the ownership and intellectual property rights. Under the arrangement, Ecosia would devote about 60 percent of Chrome&#39;s profits toward climate and environmental projects. It wouldn&#39;t pay a cent upfront for the stewardship role, but the remaining 40 percent of Chrome&#39;s profits would be given back to Google. Considering Ecosia is projecting Chrome to generate $1 trillion over the next decade, that&#39;s no small potatoes.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the surface, this idea is pretty far-out. However, going the stewardship route would deepen an existing relationship between Google and Ecosia. Google already powers the environmentally-focused benefit corporation&#39;s search engine, and the two parties have an established revenue-sharing agreement. Putting Chrome in the hands of a nonprofit rather than a for-profit rival may actually be a positive for Google, both financially and in public opinion.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nonprofit-search-engine-ecosia-offers-0-for-control-of-chrome-212158739.html?src=rss
