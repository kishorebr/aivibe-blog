<p>For many, summer means it's time to grill outdoors. But cooking inside does at least mean you’re likely to deal with fewer bugs. It also makes it easier to try out new kitchen equipment, such as a Ninja air fryer that’s on sale ahead of Prime Day.

<p>This is not a record low price for this model. However, it’s still a good price for this time of year, some five months away from Black Friday.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The DZ401 is one of our favorite air fryers. In fact, it's our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">best dual-zone air fryer</a>. It heats up quickly and runs quietly, but the real selling point here is the dual-basket setup. If you cook a lot or make meals for several people on a regular basis, the Ninja Foodi DZ401 could be a game changer.</p> 
<p>It's possible to use the two baskets to prepare entirely different foods at the same time with distinct cooking modes — you can't do that on a grill. You can also prepare food in both baskets in the same way with the Match Cook feature.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A very useful feature called Smart Finish can adjust cooking times automatically so that the food in both baskets (perhaps you have a protein in one and vegetables in the other) will be ready at the same time. That should help you avoid waiting for one basket to be down while the other gets cold.</p> 
<p>On the downside, this is a machine that will take up a considerable proportion of counter space, so it won't be ideal for small kitchens. If you can make room for it, though, the Ninja Foodi DZ401 could be a valuable addition to your setup.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-ninja-air-fryers-is-50-off-for-prime-day-131214407.html?src=rss
