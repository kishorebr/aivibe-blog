<p>Apple continues to seek a foothold in the artificial intelligence race, and its next effort could bring the company into web search. Mark Gurman at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance?embedded-checkout=true"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> reports that Apple is building a search platform that it may incorporate into its AI-driven overhaul of Siri. Sources said the tool, internally called World Knowledge Answers, could also be added to the Safari web browser and the Spotlight smartphone search interface.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s efforts in AI have been under the microscope since the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html"><ins>lackluster introduction</ins></a> of Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024. Since then, the company appears to still be foundering, with its revitalized and AI-empowered Siri now not due to arrive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html"><ins>until 2026</ins></a>. This proposed search tool would be part of that planned Siri re-launch next spring.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some core aspects of Siri are still up in the air. The company has reportedly trialed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-considering-using-gemini-to-power-the-new-siri-184528449.html"><ins>using Google&#39;s Gemini</ins></a> to power a version of the AI assistant, although it hasn&#39;t committed to using that approach. Considering an outside partnership for this critical feature is one path Apple could take to bolstering its AI offerings. CEO Tim Cook has also said the company is <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-open-to-acquisitions-to-boost-its-ai-roadmap-221925560.html"><ins>open to acquisitions</ins></a> to pursue its current roadmap. There were even rumors that the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-considering-the-acquisition-of-perplexity-ai-150012746.html"><ins>had its eyes on</ins></a> snapping up Perplexity.</p>
<p>Apple has historically avoided getting involved in search, but this development could reflect how more of its potential customers are turning to AI chatbots to access information online. And particularly if the company brings an AI option to Safari, Apple might be able to compete more directly to other tech majors that offer their own-branded chatbots, such as Google with Gemini or Microsoft with Copilot. It could also draw closer to parity with AI companies that are entering the browser game, such as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-available-now-for-200-per-month-180955616.html"><ins>Perplexity</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-own-web-browser-could-arrive-within-weeks-120039766.html"><ins>OpenAI</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-latest-ai-project-may-be-a-web-search-tool-230618495.html?src=rss
