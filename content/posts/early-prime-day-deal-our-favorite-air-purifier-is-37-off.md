Early deals have already started popping up on Amazon, and one of the best at the moment is on an Engadget-approved air purifier.

<p>The Levoit Core 400S is our current pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-air-purifier-120040002.html">best air purifier overall</a>. Sure, it might not have the prettiest design of all the options we have tested and the companion app might have a little too much going on. But the Core 400S does its job and does it well.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="577561af03ff4c2492aa0ee100c4f87b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/LEVOIT-Purifier-Allergies-Core-400S/dp/B08R794ZMX?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>This smart air purifier is slated to clean the atmosphere in spaces of up to 1,733 square feet in as little as one hour. The Core 400S has a cylindrical shape with vents at the top and a touch display that shows air quality readings. You'll be able to get a sense of the current air quality in your space at a glance with a color-changing ring that will light up in blue, green, orange or red. The 360-degree filtration system is said to be capable of capturing over 99.9 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns, such as dust, pet dander and pollen.</p> 
<p>There is an auto mode that should suffice for maintaining air quality, but the Core 400S is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls too. The fan isn't too loud, even when it's operating at maximum speed — the volume topped out at 62dB in our testing. Meanwhile, at $50 each, the air filter replacements aren't too expensive compared with those from many of Levoit's competitors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/early-prime-day-deal-our-favorite-air-purifier-is-37-off-143224190.html?src=rss
