<p>Hilarious co-op video game <em>Overcooked</em> is making the move to the real world. A24 has acquired the rights to the popular indie hit and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that the company is working with Netflix to develop the concept into an unscripted competition reality TV series. I adore this idea, and with the right people behind it, I think it could be a masterwork of reality TV. According to the reports, this is the first time independent film and TV studio A24 will make a reality show, but Netflix has already had some success with food and cooking programs, such as with the absolute gem that is <em>Nailed It!</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The often ridiculous antics of <em>Overcooked</em> are a wonderful match for that type of lighthearted competition show. In the game, one to four players work together to cook customers&#39; food orders as quickly as possible while the environment creates silly, unexpected obstacles. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way the Netflix legal team will green light challenges where contestants might fall into actual lava, and recreating the space travel levels would probably blow the budget. But I can see all sorts of <em>Overcooked</em>-style mayhem from sliding on icy floors or suddenly moving countertops. I’m also imagining a lot of dashing between inconveniently placed kitchen appliances and occasionally plunging the contestants into total darkness. There’s no timeline given in <em>Deadline</em>’s report, but I cannot wait for this to exist. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/co-op-game-overcooked-may-become-a-competition-reality-tv-show-on-netflix-222406920.html?src=rss
