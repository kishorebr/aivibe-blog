<p>Electronic Arts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> a new partnership with Stability AI, the creator of AI image generation tool <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/stable-diffusion-35-follows-your-prompts-more-closely-and-generates-more-diverse-people-184022965.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Stable Diffusion</a>. The company will &quot;co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows&quot; for the game developer, with the hopes of speeding up development while maintaining quality.</p><p>&quot;I use the term smarter paintbrushes,‚Äù Steve Kestell, Head of Technical Art for EA SPORTS said in the announcement. &quot;We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want.&quot; To start, the &quot;smarter paintbrushes&quot; EA and Stability AI are building are concentrated on generating textures and in-game assets. EA hopes to create &quot;Physically Based Rendering materials&quot; with new tools &quot;that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company also describes using AI to &quot;pre-visualize entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content.&quot; Stability AI is most famous for its powerful Stable Diffusion image generator, but the company maintains multiple tools for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stability.ai/stable-3d" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">generating 3D models</a>, too, so the partnership is by no means out of place.</p><p>It helps that AI is on the tip of most video game executives&#39; tongues. Strauss Zelnick, the head of Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two,<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-ceo-predicts-genai-will-create-jobs-not-kill-them" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"> recently shared</a> that generative AI &quot;will not reduce employment, it will increase employment,&quot; because &quot;technology always increases productivity, which in turn increases GDP, which in turn increases employment.&quot; Krafton, the publisher of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, made its commitment to AI even more clear, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcing plans</a> on Thursday to become an AI-first company. Companies with a direct stake in the success of the AI industry, like Microsoft, have also created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-windows-pcs-and-the-xbox-mobile-app-185452965.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">gaming-focused tools</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trained-an-ai-model-on-a-game-no-one-played-160038242.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">developed models</a> for prototyping. </p><p>The motivations for EA might be even simpler, though. The company is in the midst of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">being taken private</a>, and will soon be saddled with billions in debt. Theoretically cutting costs with AI might be one way the company hopes to survive the transition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-partners-with-the-company-behind-stable-diffusion-to-make-games-with-ai-222253069.html?src=rss
