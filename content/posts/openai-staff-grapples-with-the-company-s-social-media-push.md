Several current and former OpenAI researchers are speaking out over the company’s first foray into social media: the Sora app, a TikTok-style feed filled with AI-generated videos and a lot of Sam Altman deepfakes. The researchers, airing their grievances on X, seem torn over how the launch fits into OpenAI’s nonprofit mission to develop advanced AI that benefits humanity.

Former OpenAI researcher Rohan Pandey used the moment to plug a new startup, Periodic Labs, which is made up of former AI lab researchers trying to build AI systems for scientific discovery: “If you don’t want to build the infinite AI TikTok slop machine but want to develop AI that accelerates fundamental science … come join us at Periodic Labs.”

There were many other posts along the same lines.

The Sora launch highlights a core tension for OpenAI that flares up time and time again. It’s the fastest-growing consumer tech company on Earth, but it’s also a frontier AI lab with a lofty nonprofit charter. Some former O
