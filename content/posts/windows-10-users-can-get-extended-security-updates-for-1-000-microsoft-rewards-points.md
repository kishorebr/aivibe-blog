<p>As we edge closer to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-to-stop-selling-windows-10-downloads-as-part-of-planned-shutdown-133756584.html">Windows 10&#39;s end-of-support</a> on October 14, 2025, Microsoft is throwing its more stubborn users another bone. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-offers-windows-10-users-a-year-of-security-updates-for-30-160036244.html">previously announced</a> that, for the first time, consumers would be able to purchase one year of Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for $30. Today, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179753">Microsoft revealed</a> that you&#39;ll also be able to use 1,000 reward points to snap up an ESU. That could be helpful if, like me, you&#39;ve been slowly amassing Microsoft Rewards and completely forgot they existed. (You can earn points by searching on Bing, shopping on the Microsoft store and playing Xbox games.)</p>
<p>To recap, the Windows 10 ESU will get users bug fixes, security updates and technical support until October 13, 2026. If you don&#39;t pay for the ESU, you can still keep using Windows 10, you just won&#39;t get any major updates. At the very least, though, Microsoft will continue to deliver MS 365 app security updates, as well as Windows Defender antivirus intelligence updates, until October 2028. I&#39;d also wager you&#39;ll start to see plenty of notifications nagging you to update to Windows 11 after this October.</p>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says Windows 10 users will be able to enroll in its ESU through notifications and Windows Settings. The enrollment wizard is currently available to Windows Insider testers, and the company plans to start rolling it out to general users in July, with wide availability in mid-August.</p>

<p>I can understand why Windows 10 users would be reluctant to move. It was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-windows-10-review.html">a rock solid upgrade</a> after the fiasco of Windows 8, and it&#39;s simply annoying to readjust your entire workflow for a whole new OS. But I <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html">also liked Windows 11 when it debuted in 2021</a>, since it offered a more refined Windows experience. Microsoft has also addressed most of my concerns with Windows 11 by now â€” for example, you can finally see app names on the task bar again, instead of having them hidden for the sake of aesthetics.</p>
