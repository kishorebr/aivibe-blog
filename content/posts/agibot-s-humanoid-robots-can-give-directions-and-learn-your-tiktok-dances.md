<p>For better or worse, CES 2026 is already shaping up to be a big year for humanoid robots. Chinese company Agibot showed up with two: the roughly human-sized <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.agibot.com/products/A2_D" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">A2</a> and the slightly smaller <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.agibot.com/products/X2" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">X2</a>, both of which were displaying their surprisingly impressive dancing abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>We watched both robots walk around, wave at passersby and show off their best moves. The larger A2 mostly kept its legs still and danced mainly with its arms. The smaller X2 on the other hand is a bit more nimble — it has a larger set of &quot;feet&quot; to give it more stability — and those abilities were on full display.</p><p>At the time we saw them, the robots were controlled partially by an Agibot rep using a dedicated controller, but the company told me the robots are able to move autonomously in spaces once they&#39;ve been able to use their onboard sensors to map out their&nbsp; environmentThe company, which has already shipped several thousand robots in China and plans to make them available in the United States this year, says both the A2 and X2 are intended to provide a flexible platform so people can interact with the robots in a variety of situations.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year seems to be the year that the robots have learned to do laundry, dance and probably a bunch of other stuff. These humanoid 🤖 are made by Agibot and they have the dance moves down <a href="https://t.co/MnT11Xq4Yq">pic.twitter.com/MnT11Xq4Yq</a></p>— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) <a href="https://twitter.com/karissabe/status/2008392964180242887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Agibot envisions the larger A2 as a kind of hospitality helper robot that can greet visitors at museums or conferences (like CES) and provide directions or even walk alongside their human guests.&nbsp;</p><p>The smaller X2 on the other hand could be suited for educational purposes or other scenarios when you might want a robot with slightly more human-like movements. It could even be a good TikTok companion, as Agibot&#39;s head of communications, Yuheng Feng explained to me. &quot;Take a Tiktok video, for example, you can use that video to train the robot, [so] it can also dance exactly like you did in the video.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t given details on when its robots might show up in the US or how much they might cost. Feng told me a lot will depend on how companies want to use them because their hardware is able to be customized depending on the use case. For now, though, we&#39;ll just soak in the dance moves.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/agibots-humanoid-robots-can-give-directions-and-learn-your-tiktok-dances-045049798.html?src=rss
