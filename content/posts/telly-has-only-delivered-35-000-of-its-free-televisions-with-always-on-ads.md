<p>Telly appeared on the home theater scene <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/telly-will-give-you-a-free-tv-if-youll-watch-non-stop-ads-164319359.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">in 2023</a> with an unusual proposition. Its business model revolves around giving customers free dual-screen televisions where the lower screen shows non-stop advertisements. At the time, the start-up’s execs projected that Telly would ship its first 500,000 screens that summer. However, Janko Roettgers of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/telly-35000-tvs-10-percent-breakage" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Lowpass</em></a> reported that Telly only had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/telly-35000-tvs-10-percent-breakage" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">35,000 sets</a> in people&#39;s homes at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The figure appears to come from a quarterly investor update, but Telly didn&#39;t provide Roettgers with any comment on the report.</p><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want a free TV that perpetually pelts me with ads, but it seems Telly did in fact have some interest in its approach; the company reportedly had 250,000 pre-orders in June 2023. However, it ran into issues with getting those televisions to customers in one piece. The quarterly report allegedly said that 10 percent of Telly&#39;s shipments through FedEx arrived broken. A <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TellyTV/comments/1hjiwvo/broken_tellys/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">thread</a> on the company&#39;s Reddit page from a year ago backs that up, chronicling delayed shipments and broken replacements. So in short, things aren’t going so great for the company right now.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/telly-has-only-delivered-35000-of-its-free-televisions-with-always-on-ads-215033698.html?src=rss
