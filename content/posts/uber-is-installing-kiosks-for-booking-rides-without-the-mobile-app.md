<p>Uber is rolling out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/help-for-the-holidays/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">kiosks</a> for travelers to book rideshares without using the mobile app. The company is pitching the service as a convenience for international travelers who may not have a data plan, but it could also be a lifesaver if your phone runs out of juice and you don&#39;t have a way to recharge it. A passenger can use the kiosk to enter their destination and desired ride type, then will receive a printed receipt with the details about their booked ride. The first kiosk will debut in Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York City, but Uber said it would have additional locations in airports, hotels and ports over the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>In airport situations, these kiosks make Uber even more of a direct competitor to traditional taxis. With the removal of the app, the kiosk can essentially stand in as the dispatcher and a passenger can decide how to travel based on their preferences (or on wait times) for a rideshare versus a yellow cab.</p><p>Uber also used LaGuardia as the starting point for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-starts-offering-18-shuttle-rides-between-manhattan-and-laguardia-airport-193520618.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shuttle bus service</a> in New York, with $18 rides between the airport and Manhattan transit hubs in October 2024; it later <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-adds-new-shuttle-rides-between-jfk-airport-and-manhattan-100039821.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">rolled out</a> the shuttles to John F. Kennedy Airport in March 2025. Today, Uber said it is bringing the shuttle bus option to Newark Liberty International Airport, so all major NYC airports now have access to the service. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-is-installing-kiosks-for-booking-rides-without-the-mobile-app-220904106.html?src=rss
