<p>After a tumultuous 2025 that saw it lose around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-may-lose-close-to-4000-employees-after-latest-deferred-resignation-round-204452249.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">4,000 employees</a>, NASA finally has an operating budget for 2026, and one that largely preserves its scientific capabilities. On Thursday, the Senate passed an appropriations bill funding NASA, alongside the National Science Foundation and a handful of other federal agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Going into the appropriations process, the president called for a 24 percent year over year reduction to NASA&#39;s total operating budget. As part of that plan, the White House wanted to reduce the Science Mission Directorate&#39;s funding by nearly half, a move that would have forced NASA to cancel 55 ongoing and planned missions, including efforts like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OSIRIS-APEX</a>. The bill effectively rejects President Trump&#39;s plan, reducing NASA&#39;s total operating budget by just 1.6 percent year over year to $24.4 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Per the new appropriations, NASA&#39;s science budget will stand at $7.25 billion, 1.1 percent less relative to fiscal 2024, while shuffling the remaining funds to focus on different priorities. For instance, the House and Senate allocated $874 million (+8.7 percent) for the agency&#39;s heliophysics work; planetary sciences, which oversees missions like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-11-pluto-new-horizons-photos.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">New Horizons</a>, was cut to $2.5 billion (-6.5 percent) compared to 2024. At the same time, NASA&#39;s STEM engagement office, which the president proposed eliminating, escaped unscathed with its funding maintained at parity.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s almost everything we had been asking for, and it&#39;s very encouraging to see a House and Senate run by the president&#39;s own party agreeing that we need to keep investing in things like NASA science,&quot; says Casey Dreier, chief of policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit founded by Carl Sagan that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;It contains very clear and direct language that not only is this funding made available to these projects, but that it will be spent on the initiatives that Congress states.&quot;</p><p>Lawmakers also rejected Trump&#39;s effort to scuttle the Space Launch System after its third flight. NASA&#39;s heavy-lift rocket is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasas-sls-rocket-is-6-billion-over-budget-and-six-years-behind-schedule-091432515.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">billions of dollars over budget</a>, but remains — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-booster-for-spacexs-starship-v3-suffered-a-gas-system-failure-during-testing-181459063.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">as of now</a> — the only spacecraft ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. Compared to the rest of NASA, the fate of the SLS was never really in doubt. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured funding for the rocket as part of Trump&#39;s Big Beautiful Bill. &quot;I&#39;ve been saying for a long time you should never underestimate the political coalition behind the SLS, and I think that was very much validated this year,&quot; says Dreier.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, it appears the Goddard Space Flight Center will be safe from further damage. Over the summer, the future of the facility, known for its work on projects like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-has-captured-its-first-direct-image-of-an-exoplanet-172346802.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, was put in jeopardy. By some estimates, the campus has lost a third of its staff due to workforce cuts, and dozens of buildings, including some 100 laboratories, have been shut down by management. One of the casualties was <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cd421e48-bc53-4a4f-a1c2-3f92df7c2b2d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=NASA%27s+largest+library&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzMxL2NsaW1hdGUvbmFzYS1nb2RkYXJkLWxpYnJhcnktY2xvc2luZy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjZDQyMWU0OC1iYzUzLTRhNGYtYTFjMi0zZjkyZGY3YzJiMmQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTIvMzEvY2xpbWF0ZS9uYXNhLWdvZGRhcmQtbGlicmFyeS1jbG9zaW5nLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdDG4N3Z_ZUyGFVBZJ01qsP1SOmaB9N_9JSszOSmqQvh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F12%2F31%2Fclimate%2Fnasa-goddard-library-closing.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/climate/nasa-goddard-library-closing.html">NASA&#39;s largest library</a>, which houses irreplaceable documents chronicling the history of the space race. As part of a &quot;consolidation&quot; effort, many of those documents will be thrown out.</p><p>Under the appropriations bill, the Senate has directed NASA to “preserve all the technical and scientific world-class capabilities at Goddard.” It has also instructed the agency to ensure employees of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are able to continue their work with &quot;minimal disruption.&quot; The New York-based office, one of America&#39;s leading climate labs, was sent into limbo last spring after the Trump administration moved to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/climate/nasa-giss-lab-turmoil-trump-budget" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">shut it down</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill also provides a lifeline for NASA&#39;s to bring <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">back samples of Martian dirt</a> collected by the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasas-perseverance-rover-finds-potential-signs-of-ancient-life-on-mars-173457976.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Perseverance rover</a>. Congress has effectively cancelled the official program tied to that ambition, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-sample-return/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Mars Sample Return</a> (MSR), but has set aside $110 million for the agency to continue developing technologies for future science missions to the Red Planet. MSR advocates have argued the mission could lead to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-budget-calls-for-stranding-nasas-mars-samples-on-the-red-planet/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">significant scientific discoveries</a>, but Dreier notes the program was &quot;ripe for cancellation&quot; after it became mired in mismanagement.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I worry MSR now has this stink of bloat, excess cost and threat of overruns that are really going to make it challenging to restart this without having a dramatically different approach,&quot; says Dreier, adding that deciding what to do with mission will likely be top of mind for the agency&#39;s new administrator, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Jared Isaacman</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2026 budget leaves NASA with fewer resources. Even in areas where Congress allocated the same amount of funds as it did in 2024, the agency will need to do more with less due to inflation. Compared to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trumps-defunding-of-nasa-would-be-catastrophic-153053020.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">absolute blood bath</a> that would have been Trump&#39;s proposed budget, a marginal funding cut is the best case scenario given the circumstances, but the circumstances remain less than ideal.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;There will be another presidential budget request coming out in the next couple of months,&quot; Dreier said. &quot;They could do this all over again if they wanted to.&quot;</p><p>In the immediate future, NASA and its employees are at least protected from the potential fallout of another impending government shutdown. Congress has until January 30 to fully fund the federal government, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5685563-congress-funding-government-shutdown/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">as of earlier this week</a>, it has yet to find a way forward on appropriations for agencies like the Department of Labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Correction 9:05PM ET</strong>: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Casey Dreier’s surename as Drier.
