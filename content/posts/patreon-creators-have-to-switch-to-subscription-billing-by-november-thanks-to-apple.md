<p>Patreon creators will need to make some changes soon, thanks to Apple. On Wednesday, Patreon said Apple has renewed its requirement that all Patreon creators must move to subscription billing. The deadline to do so is November 1, 2026.</p><p>Patreon&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a> announcing the change made it clear that it had no other choice. &quot;We strongly disagree with this decision,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months.&quot;</p><p>Up to this point, Patreon’s billing model has operated in a gray area, allowing its creators to charge fans outside the App Store without paying Apple’s fees. When the issue first surfaced, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">described</a> it as stemming from how paid content was accessed (only some creators offered content that could be consumed in-app). On Wednesday, a Patreon representative described the gray area as being “because Apple’s In-App Purchase system doesn’t support some of Patreon’s longstanding billing models.”</p><p>But now Apple has reimposed its subscription mandate, eliminating the gray area. &quot;We know that Apple is serious about enforcing this mandate,&quot; Patreon wrote. &quot;Late last year, they blocked a Patreon app update and made it clear that in order to remain in the App Store, we have to comply with their billing requirement. Because millions of fans use iOS as their primary way to access Patreon and connect with creators, having our app blocked — or not available in the App Store at all — isn&#39;t an option.&quot;</p><p>Patreon’s &quot;whiplash&quot; description isn&#39;t hyperbole. Apple first announced the mandate in 2024. At that time, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="slk:deadline;cpos:3;pos:1">deadline</a> for all Patreon creators to make the switch was set to November 2025 — one that Patreon grudgingly accepted. But according to the company, Apple told it last May that the original 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. Now, it appears to have reversed that again.</p><p>If there&#39;s a silver lining, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/apple-tells-patreon-to-move-creators-to-in-app-purchase-for-subscriptions-by-november/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a> that only 4 percent of Patreon creators are using the affected (legacy) billing models. And fans can still bypass Apple&#39;s fees on iOS by joining via their iPhone&#39;s web browser. Patreon has much more detail for creators in its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcement post</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" style="height:3290px;width:4934px;" alt="DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 21: U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks to Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) as he attends a reception for business leaders at the&nbsp;World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting on January 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland.
