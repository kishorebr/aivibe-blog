<p>Remedy Entertainment&#39;s <em>Control </em>is a bizarre yet totally captivating action game that feels like <em>Die Hard</em> by way of David Lynch. In<em>Control: Resonant</em>, players step into the role of the original game&#39;s most enigmatic and unsettling characters for their own jaunt through a &#39;new-weird&#39; world outside The Oldest House.</p><p>Just ahead of the reveal at The Game Awards, we got an early look at <em>Control: Resonant</em>, the next game in the Remedy Connected Universe. Along with learning why the developers wanted a new protagonist, they also explain why this <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion-</em>inspired<em> </em>sequel is the most expansive game they have made to date.</p><p>Seven years after the events of <em>Control</em>, the hostile supernatural force that plagued The Oldest House has invaded Manhattan. As the massive urban landscape morphs into an otherworldly nightmare and the Federal Bureau of Control director, Jesse Faden, goes missing, the remaining FBC sends her brother, the notorious supernatural entity Dylan Faden, into the city to stop the invasion. To find his sister and stop the devastation from spreading beyond New York City, Dylan will have to embrace his powers, and some occasional guidance from The Board, to take on the malevolent forces looking to reshape the world.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In the years since <em>Control</em>&#39;s release, developer Remedy has expanded the story into a larger, connected universe spanning multiple games, including the Alan Wake<em> </em>series and the co-op spin-off <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. <em>Control: Resonant</em> picks up on many threads left by recent games including <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which saw the FBC investigate the supernatural events following the titular character.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the sequel is going with a bit of a different direction, this time embracing melee-driven combat and a more &quot;open-ended&quot; approach to exploration within the <em>Inception</em>-style landscape of Manhattan. Though the developers were clear that it is not an open-world game, they stated during the presentation that it is embracing a more action-RPG approach and that it&#39;s also the most expansive game they have ever made.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting premise for a sequel, especially considering the focus on the original game&#39;s most unnerving characters. But according to creative director Mikael Kasurinen, the concept ties into showing parallels between the Faden siblings and how they navigate this new-weird world.</p><p>&quot;Each game represents one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world. Because of this, you can play these games in any order; they stand on their own feet like two independent siblings,&quot; Kasurinen said. &quot;When Dylan wakes up, he&#39;s the only one who can fight back against the Hiss and try to contain the disaster. He has lived his whole life inside The Oldest House, so the door leading outside to Manhattan might as well be a portal to an alien world. To him, this leads to a discovery of a new reality, just like what The Oldest House was to Jesse.&quot;</p><p>Much like the original game, <em>Control: Resonant</em> maintains that balance of exploration, discovery, and over-the-top action beats to overcome. The sequel leans a bit further into the latter, with Dylan adopting a more aggressive, brawler combat style with his shapeshifting melee weapon. We got to see Dylan switch between short-bladed weapons and a massive hammer, which opened some cool looking combo attacks. It&#39;s very much in the vein of Jesse&#39;s Service Weapon, but now designed for getting up close to deal heavy melee damage.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/controlresonant3_6143.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/controlresonant3_6143.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Control Resonant screenshot" data-uuid="0b8ed291-20ec-4ca4-9566-c67d000b3340" data-display-size="large"/><figcaption>Control Resonant screenshot</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Remedy Entertainment</div></figure><p>From what we saw in the footage, the core combat feels equal parts <em>Nier: Automata</em> and <em>DmC: Devil May Cry</em>, showing Dylan dodging attacks and slipping through blind spots to unleash ground and aerial combo strikes. It&#39;s a notable shift away from the third-person shooting gameplay from the original, but it still captures the same weird, otherworldly feel.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the creative director, the core inspiration for making a sequel with a new character was to contrast storytelling perspectives and gameplay styles — as he puts it, both characters represent two sides of the same coin.</p><p>&quot;When we looked at the siblings [as characters], it was almost like turning to the other side of a coin – Jesse uses a gun, but Dylan chooses a melee weapon. When we created the large environments, compared to the original, it was a challenge to incorporate shooting combat, as we didn&#39;t want people to have to keep finding cover to avoid fire. But with melee weapons, the combat instantly became more aggressive and intimate, where you&#39;re really going for the enemies. It really changed the dynamic of the Control combat experience. So it felt right, and it&#39;s also refreshing for us to create something a bit new for us.&quot;</p><p>So far, <em>Control: Resonant</em> looks like a sequel that ups the weirdness of the series and takes it into the twisting, inverted streets of Manhattan. It&#39;s a stunning-looking game, and one particular source of inspiration for the creative direction was the seminal 1990s anime series <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. Having seen the game&#39;s corrupted world and enigmatic protagonist in motion, that totally tracks. I can&#39;t wait to see what other oddities are to come in Remedy&#39;s new-weird sequel.</p><p><em>Control: Resonant </em>will arrive in 2026 for PC/Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CTRL_R_Announce_SS_1_6038.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CTRL_R_Announce_SS_1_6038.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Control Resonant screenshot" data-uuid="6e5691f6-7956-4bf6-a264-6fb3f12b2e7e" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Control Resonant screenshot</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Remedy Entertainment</div></figure><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html?src=rss
