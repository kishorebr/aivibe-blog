<p>After revealing his company&#39;s latest <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-offer-an-ar-display-for-799-002921925.html">augmented reality</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-unveils-its-second-gen-ray-ban-smart-glasses-at-connect-000834325.html">smart</a> glasses at Meta Connect this year, Mark Zuckerberg has introduced a new entertainment hub for its Quest headsets called Horizon TV. Zuckerberg said Meta believes watching video content is going to be a huge category for both virtual reality headsets and glasses in the future. Meta has already teamed up with several major streaming services to provide shows and movies you can enjoy in VR. One of those partners is Disney+, which will give users access to the Marvel Cinematic Universe on their headsets, as well as to content from ESPN and Hulu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the interface Zuckerberg showed on the event, which had a lineup of streaming apps that will be available on the hub, Meta also teamed up with Prime Video, Spotify, Peacock and Twitch. That will allow you to watch shows, such as <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Fallout</em> on your virtual reality devices. Meta also partnered with Universal Pictures and iconic horror company Blumhouse, so that you can watch horror flicks like <em>M3GAN</em> and <em>The Black Phone</em> on your Quest &quot;with immersive special effects you won’t find anywhere else.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Horizon TV hub supports Dolby Atmos for immersive sounds, with Dolby Vision arriving later this year for richer colors and crisper details. For a limited time, you&#39;ll be able to watch an exclusive 3D clip of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> on Horizon TV, as well, as part of Meta&#39;s partnership with James Cameron’s Lightstorm Vision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/meta-horizon-tv-is-an-entertainment-hub-for-vr-headsets-011216955.html?src=rss
