<p>It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-may-start-hosting-user-generated-ai-videos-185000745.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Bob Iger’s promise</a> to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-openai-sora-agreement/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">agreement with OpenAI</a> to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Sora app</a> and ChatGPT.  With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. </p><p>The agreement does not include voices or “talent likenesses,” meaning Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson in it. Instead, both Sora and ChatGPT will only have access to animated and illustrated versions of Marvel and Star Wars characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Han Solo, Darth Vader and others. Disney will stream “curated selections” of Sora-generated fan videos on Disney+. Sora and ChatGPT users will be able to start generating images and videos with Disney characters starting in early 2026.    </p><p>“Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”</p><p>Disney has also agreed to become an OpenAI customer, promising to use the company’s APIs to build new products, tools and experiences. Additionally, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI, with the option to purchase additional equity down the road. OpenAI recently completed a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-completes-corporate-reorganization-with-support-from-microsoft-133109385.html" data-i13n="slk:restructuring;cpos:4;pos:1">restructuring</a> to become more of traditional profit-seeking corporation, clearing the way for a potential IPO sometime in the next year or so. Still, the pact <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">brings together two unlikely bedfellows</a> who have been on opposite sides of the copyright debate. </p><p>Reaction from the entertainment industry was mixed. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wgawest.bsky.social/post/3m7qhlzd6js2x" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a statement released on Bluesky</a>, The Writers Guild of America, which represents writers across film, television and other media, made it clear it is unhappy with the deal:</p><blockquote><p>“Disney’s deal with OpenAI appears to sanction its theft of our work and cedes the value of what we create to a tech company that has built its business off our backs. We will meet with Disney to probe the terms of this deal, including the extent to which user-generated videoes will use the work of WGA members. We will continue to fight to protect our members’ creative and economic interests in the context of AI technology.”</p></blockquote><p>SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors union which has around 160,000 members worldwide, was less incendiary. It <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/disney-openai-dealgoogle-notice" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">posted a notice on its site</a> saying that both Disney and OpenAI had reached out to the union to give “their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers.” The union noted it would “closely monitor the deal and its implementation to ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice, and likeness.”</p><p><strong>Update, December 11, 5:45PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publish to include comment from the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html?src=rss
