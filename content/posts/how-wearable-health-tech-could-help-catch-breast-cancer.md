    How wearable health tech could help catch breast cancer
     
    Coupled with AI, health data from wearables could significantly improve survival rates. This MIT professor is developing a device to do just that.

On a recent segment with Bloomberg, Dr. Dagdeviren discussed a breast cancer monitoring device her team is working on. These devices take biological signals and turn them into electrical signals for condition interpretation and analysis. The device is described as a wearable ultrasound patch that would screen for breast cancer outside of the doctor's office. She explains that the current standard of care for breast cancer screening is mammography, which she describes as a "painful" technology that doesn't work perfectly, especially for those with higher breast density. A non-invasive, more effective alternative The device her team is developing, on the other hand, is radiation-free, non-invasive, and can detect anomalies in "subseconds," accord
