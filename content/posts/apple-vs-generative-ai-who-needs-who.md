And the AI features that have arrived -- such as summaries of a string of text messages -- have been both game-changing and, at times, super frustrating to use. Also: Apple's de-chatbot-ification of AI is nearly completeStill, the generative AI revolution that is sweeping the tech industry is in desperate need of many of the qualities that Apple usually exemplifies in its approach to products. I'm talking about qualities like polish, attention to detail, user trust, and patience.While generative AI is racing forward at a breakneck pace, it continues to feel half-baked and overhyped much of the time.
