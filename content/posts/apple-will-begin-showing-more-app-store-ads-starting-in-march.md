<p>More ads are coming to App Store search results starting in March, Apple shared on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/ad-placements/0082-search-results" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">an advertising help page</a>. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-bringing-even-more-ads-to-the-app-store-193416921.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">first said</a> that it would increase the number of App Store ads last month, and this new rollout of search ads will begin on Tuesday, March 3, according to a developer email <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/more-app-store-ads-coming-soon/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">viewed by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>&quot;Search is the way most people find and download apps on the App Store, with nearly 65 percent of downloads happening directly after a search,&quot; Apple says. &quot;To help give advertisers more opportunities to drive downloads from search results, Apple Ads will introduce additional ads across search queries.&quot; Up until this point, ads for related apps have appeared at the top of search results, but now they&#39;ll also appear &quot;further down in search results,&quot; according to Apple.</p><p>App Store activity makes up a significant portion of what Apple calls its <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/2025-marked-a-record-breaking-year-for-apple-services/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1">&quot;services&quot; business</a>. The company makes money on every App Store transaction, whether it&#39;s an app download or an in-app purchase, and increasingly, by selling ad space to companies looking to reach users. App Store ads are hardly new, but the number of ads has steadily increased over the years. Apple <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-today-tab-ads-152249659.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">added ads to the Today tab</a> in 2022 — a space that&#39;s already home to editorial curation that doubles as marketing — and in 2025, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-26/what-s-next-for-the-ipad-pro-iphone-17-pro-like-vapor-chamber-apple-maps-ads-mh7nq39h" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a> the company planned to bring ads to Apple Maps.</p><p>Apple&#39;s decision to rebrand its advertising business from Apple Search Ads to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/14/apple-rebrands-search-ads-business-as-apple-ads/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Apple Ads</a> in April 2025 was maybe the best indication that the company was interested in expanding the number of places it would help partners try and reach customers. And it makes sense: the company&#39;s billions of devices, each pre-installed with default apps, are some of the most valuable real estate it owns.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-will-begin-showing-more-app-store-ads-starting-in-march-192031226.html?src=rss
