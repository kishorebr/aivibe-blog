If you aren&#39;t looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 30 percent off, bringing it down to just $90 from its usual price of $130. The ANC version is on sale too, for anyone not on as tight a budget. AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation are going for $150 right now, down from $180.</p>

<p>The Apple AirPods 4 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html"><ins>best budget AirPods</ins></a> you can get in 2025, with Apple&#39;s H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won&#39;t have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple&#39;s hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don&#39;t have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. With the ANC version, you also have access to Live Translation, which can be initiated by pressing and holding the stem on both AirPods simultaneously.</p> 
<p>You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. On the other model with ANC active, that play time drops by about an hour.</p>
