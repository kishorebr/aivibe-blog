<p>In a mad, mad world, speedruns for charity can be a calm oasis. Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) has your fix with the 2025 edition of the marathon. You can tune in starting on Sunday, July 6. As usual, the lineup includes loads of fun games and bonkers challenges.</p>
<p>It's fitting that this year's lineup includes a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> game. On the event's last day, the speedrunner Peas will take on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-mario-kart-world-is-the-opposite-of-punishing-110039837.html"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> on the new console.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a7ee2080-5770-11f0-b7df-0ceb3cc474a6" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a7ee2080-5770-11f0-b7df-0ceb3cc474a6" style="height:1181px;width:2100px;" alt="Mario racing in Mario Kart World." data-uuid="35a536b5-0a9d-323f-a939-69b6dde9ee48"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure>
<p>Perhaps to commemorate the new console's launch, Nintendo is everywhere at this event. There are three Zelda games on tap: <em>Majora's Mask</em>, <em>Phantom Hourglass</em> and <em>Link's Awakening</em>. The company's plumber mascot is peppered all over the place, too. You'll find <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-review.html"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <em>Mario Paint</em> and the <em>Super Mario World</em> hack, <em>Sayonara Mario World 2</em>. (Not done yet!) There's also <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-super-mario-maker-2-review-switch.html"><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em></a>, <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Super Mario 64</em>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of non-Nintendo stuff, too. The week kicks off with an "All Emeralds Glitched" run of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. One of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html">Engadget's all-time favorites</a>, <em>Balatro</em>, has a run scheduled on July 11. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-great-movie-good-game-000029449.html"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a> makes an appearance. And two speedrunning legends will try to beat <em>Cuphead</em> during an allotted 35 minutes. (Say what??!) Anyone who can finish <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-22-cuphead-hands-on.html">that bloodbath</a> in less than that should be named the leader of the free world.</p>

<p>The event will raise funds for <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a>. The humanitarian nonprofit has a legion of nearly 63,000 medical personnel. It offers clinical and humanitarian care in over 70 countries. Last summer's event raised $2.5 million. To date, Games Done Quick events have raised over $50 million for charity.</p>
<p>SGDQ 2025 runs from July 6 to 13. If you're in or near Minneapolis, you can <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">register</a> to attend in person.
