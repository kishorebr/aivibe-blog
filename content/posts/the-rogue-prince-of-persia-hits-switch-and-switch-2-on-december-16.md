<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 consoles on December 16. The game was in early access for around a year before being officially released for PC and consoles <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-officially-out-for-pc-and-consoles-184621675.html"><ins>back in August</ins></a>.</p>
<p>This version has been &quot;optimized for handheld and hybrid play&quot; and includes all content from the original release. That means players will be able access a wide variety of biomes, weapons and secrets.</p>

<p>This is a unique take on the Prince of Persia franchise, bringing parkour-style movement and combat to the roguelike genre. It&#39;s a fun and frenetic experience that calls to mind another sidescrolling roguelike, <em>Dead Cells</em>. This game was actually co-developed by Evil Empire, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-13-motion-twin-dead-cells-nintendo-switch-irl.html"><ins>the company behind </ins><em><ins>Dead Cells</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>This is a digital release, but collectors have something to look forward to. <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is getting a deluxe physical release on April 10 for Switch, Switch 2 and PS5.</p>
<p>This physical version ships with a game key card, a double-sided poster and a set of cards depicting scenes from the game. When flipped, the cards join together to make up a portion of the title&#39;s world map. Incidentally, there&#39;s no physical version coming for Xbox Series X/S, despite already being available to download.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-hits-switch-and-switch-2-on-december-16-194828522.html?src=rss
