<p class="has-text-align-none">After quietly pausing the rollout of Google Photos’ AI-powered “Ask Photos” search tool, Google is now expanding access once again and making some improvements to the feature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google’s Gemini AI models power Ask Photos so that you can ask complex questions to help you find photos. But earlier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678858/google-photos-ask-photos-ai-search-rollout-pause">this month</a>, a member of the Google Photos team <a href="https://x.com/jamieasp/status/1929895255844745284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1929895255844745284%7Ctwgr%5Ee0f85e14daa8f01284e2d8aa616c150ccf7965db%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F678858%2Fgoogle-photos-ask-photos-ai-search-rollout-pause">said on X that</a> the feature “isn&#8217;t where it needs to be, in terms of latency, quality and UX.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a blog post published Thursday, <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/updates-ask-photos-search/">Google said</a> that it has “heard your feedback” that the feature should “return more photos faster for simple searches, like ‘beach’ or ‘dogs.’” Now, “you’ll now see results right away while Gemini models continue to work in the background to find the most relevant photos or information for more complex queries,” according to Google.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company adds that the feature is now “opening up beyond early access” and is beginning to roll out to more “<a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">eligible users</a>” in the US.</p>
