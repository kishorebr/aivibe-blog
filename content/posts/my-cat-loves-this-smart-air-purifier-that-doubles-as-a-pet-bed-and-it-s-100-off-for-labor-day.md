And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services weâ€™re assessing.When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews.  Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers.ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader.

    The PetAir Pro from Blueair gets rid of pet hair, cleans the air of pet dander, and even acts as a comfy bed for your pet. Plus, you can save $100 on it during Labor Day weekend.
