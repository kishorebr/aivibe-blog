<p>Mozilla is working on a new tool for Firefox called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">AI Window</a>. This will be an opt-in space for chatting with an AI assistant and getting help from it while browsing. The goal with this project appears to be giving users more control over when and how they choose to interact with AI. AI Window will be another option for users alongside the standard Firefox window and the Private Window, which will continue to offer more privacy protections. The feature is still in development, so interested users can sign up in Mozilla&#39;s blog post to be among the first users and provide feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>AI built into browsers is one of the current hot issues among tech companies.
