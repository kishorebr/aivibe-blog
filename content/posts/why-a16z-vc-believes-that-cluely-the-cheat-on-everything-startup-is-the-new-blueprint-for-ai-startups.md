When Cluely, a startup claiming to be building a product that helps people “cheat” on everything, announced that it raised a $15 million Series A financing round from Andreessen Horowitz, some people on X criticized the VC firm for backing the controversial company.

After all, Cluely isn’t just offering a product that may have questionable uses; the startup has also become famous for using what many people call rage-bait marketing.


	
	




	
	



But Cluely’s ability to grab attention is precisely what attracted a16z to the startup.

Even before meeting Cluely’s founder Roy Lee, Andreessen Horowitz’s partner Bryan Kim thought that startups need new marketing tactics in the AI era.

Kim, like many investors, previously thought that building a superb “artisan” product with highly desired features was the key to a startup’s lasting success, he explained on the latest a16z podcast episode.

But shortly after the emergence of generative AI, he noticed that offering an exceptional product might not be enough.

“If you craft this thing and OpenAI or someone builds a new model to include that part in their product, you’re done,” Kim said. “So, it couldn’t become this highly thoughtful, slow-build product. It needed to be something where founders moved extremely quickly.”
