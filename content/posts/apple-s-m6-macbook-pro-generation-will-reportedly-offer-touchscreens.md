<p>Apple insiders are pointing to a tactile new future for the company&#39;s laptops. Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/a-macbook-pro-touchscreen-about-damn-time-180000315.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">suggested</a> that Apple would incorporate touchscreens into MacBooks some time in the next few years, &quot;further blurring the line with the iPad.&quot; Today, Mark Gurman at <em>Bloomberg</em> confirmed that prediction, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">sharing</a> even more specifics about the touchscreen approach for a MacBook Pro that is currently projected for release in late 2026 or early 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>Gurman reports that the touchscreen laptops are internally known as K114 and K116, and will run on M6 chips; Apple just introduced the M5 generation of its silicon for this year&#39;s iteration of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-first-products-with-apples-m5-chip-could-make-their-debut-this-week-163149688.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">MacBook Pro</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">iPad Pro</a>. His sources also say that the laptops will have OLED screens and will boast &quot;a reinforced hinge and screen hardware&quot; so that the display portion doesn&#39;t move when being used. The laptops will still have a trackpad and keyboard for non-touchscreen control, and will be housed in &quot;thinner and lighter frames.&quot; Finally, this laptop will reportedly abandon the notch housing for the MacBook Pro&#39;s camera in favor of a hole-punch design that leaves a display area around that sensor.</p><p>Longtime Apple leader Steve Jobs was adamantly opposed to touchscreen computers. But most other computer companies have had touchscreen models available for about a decade, so Apple did adhere to that philosophy for a really long time. Rather than bring touch to a laptop, for a while Apple was trying to position the iPad as being capable of doing all the tasks you&#39;d use a laptop for, as epitomized in the notorious &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">what&#39;s a computer?</a>&quot; ad. It should be interesting to see how touch MacBooks and iPads will coexist.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-m6-macbook-pro-generation-will-reportedly-offer-touchscreens-203029809.html?src=rss
