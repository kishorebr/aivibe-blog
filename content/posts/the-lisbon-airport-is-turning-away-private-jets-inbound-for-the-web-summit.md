<p>Startup founders and government officials have been confronted with a unique flavor of first-world problem at this year&#39;s Web Summit<em>, </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/90f518e1-907a-4526-9cc1-e405f3ac7be1" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Financial Times</em> reports</a>. The Lisbon Airport has been forced to turn some private jets away, sending flights to seek runway space at airports as far away as Badajoz, a Spanish city two hours away from Lisbon.</p><p>The issue might come with the territory. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://websummit.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Web Summit</a> is a technology business conference that tends to attract investors, startups and high-profile keynote speakers — this year&#39;s conference features talks from the CEO of Qualcomm and the President of Microsoft, for example — many of whom prefer to fly private. That poses a problem for the Lisbon Airport.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Please be advised that there is currently a shortage of private jet slots during Web Summit at Lisbon Airport (LIS) and surrounding smaller airports,&quot; Web Summit organizers reportedly told attendees. &quot;Lisbon Airport is experiencing difficulty managing the volume of traffic, resulting in a lack of available take-off and landing slots for all operations.&quot;</p><p><em>FT</em> writes that this kind of airport bottleneck is a first for the conference, and likely caused as much by a growing predilection for private jets as it is the larger number of attendees at this year&#39;s Web Summit. Setting aside the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/carbon-pollution-from-high-flying-rich-in-private-jets-soars" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">environmental impact</a> of flying private, you&#39;d think all those brilliant minds could come up with some kind of solution beyond flying further away and driving into Portugal. Maybe a jet that hundreds of people can charter at once?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-lisbon-airport-is-turning-away-private-jets-inbound-for-the-web-summit-222136161.html?src=rss
