<p>Customer service support company 5CA has released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://5ca.com/blog/holding-statement-security-incident/">statement</a> contradicting <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-now-says-70000-government-ids-may-have-leaked-in-provider-hack-225753321.html">claims by Discord</a> that it was the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/discord-users-ids-and-data-compromised-in-customer-service-provider-hack-140053655.html">victim of a hack</a> last month. On October 3, Discord <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/discord-users-ids-and-data-compromised-in-customer-service-provider-hack-140053655.html">disclosed</a> a data breach that the company says included a “small number” of government IDs like driver’s licenses and passports, which some users had submitted to verify their ages. Days later the company updated <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">its statement</a> to name 5CA as the target of the hack, which Discord contracts as part of its customer service efforts. It also disclosed that the &quot;small number&quot; of government IDs encompasses roughly 70,000 users.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of media reports naming 5CA as the cause of a data breach involving one of our clients. Contrary to these reports, we can confirm that none of 5CA’s systems were involved, and 5CA has not handled any government-issued IDs for this client. All our platforms and systems remain secure, and client data continues to be protected under strict data protection and security controls,&quot; the company’s statement reads in part. The company goes on to explicitly state &quot;the incident occurred outside of our systems and that 5CA was not hacked.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>5CA says that a preliminary investigation showed that the incident may have been the result of &quot;human error,&quot; though it offers no details as to what exactly that implies. In a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-claim-discord-breach-exposed-data-of-55-million-users/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a>, the hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach said they had access to Discord&#39;s Zendesk account for 58 hours on September 20. The group claims they gained entry through compromised login credentials belonging to a support agent employed by a third-party company.  Discord has not yet responded to the company’s claims.</p>
