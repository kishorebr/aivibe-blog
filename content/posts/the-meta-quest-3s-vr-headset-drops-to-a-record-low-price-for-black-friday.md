It normally goes for $300. With the purchase, you also get the game <em>Gorilla Tag</em> for free. There&#39;s also a 256GB option, which is on sale as well and comes with <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>. That version costs $330, down from its usual price of $400.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html"><ins>90 in Engadget&#39;s review</ins></a>, landing it among our picks for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html"><ins>the best VR headsets</ins></a> around right now. It&#39;s comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn&#39;t quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience. In his review, Engadget&#39;s Devindra Hardawar said the 3S is &quot;the best $300 standalone VR headset we&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-drops-to-a-record-low-price-for-black-friday-180911805.html?src=rss
