The Peace Corps&#39; latest proposal will recruit STEM graduates or those with professional experience in the artificial intelligence sector and send them to participating host countries.</p>
<p>According to the press release, volunteers will be placed in Peace Corps countries that are part of the American AI Exports Program, which was created last year from an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://aiexports.gov/">executive order</a> from President Trump as a way to bolster the US&#39; grip on the AI market abroad. Tech Corps members will be tasked with using AI to resolve issues related to agriculture, education, health and economic development. The program will offer its members 12- to 27-month in-person assignments or virtual placements, which will include housing, healthcare, a living stipend and a volunteer service award if the corps member is placed overseas.</p>
