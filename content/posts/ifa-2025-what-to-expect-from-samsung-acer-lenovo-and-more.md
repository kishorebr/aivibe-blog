<p>IFA, Europe&#39;s answer to the CES, kicks off on September 5 in Berlin, Germany. The show likely won&#39;t be the biggest source of news in September — Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9--heres-what-we-expect-090059664.html"><ins>iPhone launch event</ins></a> is officially happening on September 9 — but it is usually home to its fair share of announcements. IFA 2024 featured new &quot;AI PCs&quot; from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-introduces-six-new-copilot-pc-laptops-160014998.html"><ins>ASUS</ins></a> and Dell, including <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-brings-qualcomms-snapdragon-x-plus-to-inspiron-and-latitude-laptops-110009714.html"><ins>the first Inspiron laptop</ins></a> with Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon X Plus chip. There were plenty of more unusual ideas, too: Honor used the show to introduce <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/honors-new-laptop-has-a-detachable-webcam-130006729.html"><ins>a laptop with a detachable webcam</ins></a>, for example.</p>
<p>Based on the companies that are confirmed to have presence at the show, similar themes will be woven through IFA 2025. AI and features enabled by it will likely be everywhere, especially in home appliances. Laptops, whether they&#39;re running Intel&#39;s Panther Lake chips or something Arm-based, are sure to be in the mix. And smart glasses will likely continue to be a going concern. Below are the companies who are confirmed to be holding events at the show, and what we think they might announce.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z foldables and Galaxy Watch 8 in the rear view, there aren&#39;t many personal electronics Samsung has left to announce this year. That could be why the company&#39;s IFA press conference seems focused on the smart home. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.ifa-berlin.com/programme/samsung-md-pc"><ins>Samsung&#39;s IFA presentation</ins></a>, dubbed &quot;AI Home: Future Living, Now&quot; is supposed to be focused on the company&#39;s home appliances. Specifically, Samsung says it will &quot;highlight the transformative potential of AI in the home.&quot; Samsung already showed off how AI plays into its new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsungs-2025-bespoke-appliances-are-going-all-in-on-ai-020018377.html"><ins>Bespoke AI home appliances</ins></a> at CES 2025, so it&#39;s possible the company could have new additions to the lineup. It&#39;ll hopefully also share when its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/the-cute-samsung-ballie-home-robot-will-actually-go-on-sale-this-year-223528677.html"><ins>Ballie robot</ins></a> will be available for purchase.</p>
<p>We also know for a fact that Samsung is hosting <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-will-hold-another-unpacked-on-september-4-230040711.html"><ins>a virtual Unpacked event</ins></a> on September 4, which could point to some other products the company will show off at IFA 2025. All signs point to the next Unpacked being about tablets and midrange phones. Samsung is rumored to be announcing both the Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra, which will carry over the general look and feel of the company&#39;s past tablets with a few important tweaks, <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://winfuture.de/news,153113.html"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>WinFuture</ins></em></a>. Besides battery improvements and Android 16, the biggest change Samsung is reportedly making is using a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip in the tablets rather than its own Exynos models or something from Qualcomm. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is considered the top of the line, so opting for MediaTek could raise questions about performance, but we&#39;ll have to use the tablets to know for sure.</p>
<p>Samsung is also rumored to be announcing the Galaxy S25 FE at the event. It becomes less clear by the year what &quot;FE&quot; or &quot;Fan Edition&quot; means, but the Galaxy S25 FE is expected to have some meaningful improvements over the Galaxy S24 FE. Alongside a Samsung-designed Exynos chip, the S25 FE is rumored to feature an improved 12MP selfie camera and a 4,900mAh battery with 45W charging, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-s25-fe-leak-shows-it-all-angles-reveals-color-options/"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>SamMobile</ins></em></a>.</p>

<p>Like Samsung, Acer is hosting its own <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Acer;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=56197a86-8c27-4ba2-9aa1-20de6e52c761&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a02aa910-7539-49e7-bc3a-afb19e0bc931&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Acer&amp;linkText=press+conference&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2VyLmNvbS91cy1lbi9ldmVudHMvbmV4dGF0YWNlciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTAyYWE5MTAtNzUzOS00OWU3LWJjM2EtYWZiMTllMGJjOTMxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2VyLmNvbS91cy1lbi9ldmVudHMvbmV4dGF0YWNlciJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASJ1Q38OcU__P7nzgI-6WPU_RkU37_GCsx3d4EOdfOL2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fus-en%2Fevents%2Fnextatacer" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.acer.com/us-en/events/nextatacer"><ins>press conference</ins></a> at IFA 2025. The company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.ifa-berlin.com/programme/acer-pc"><ins>description</ins></a> of the event is frustratingly vague, but does suggest announcements focused on both productivity and gaming. At IFA 2024, Acer introduced multiple Copilot+PCs, including updates to the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/acers-new-swift-edge-14-ai-laptop-packs-in-a-matte-display-and-ai-features-130010112.html"><ins>Swift</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-refreshes-its-swift-and-aspire-laptops-with-intel-core-ultra-and-dedicated-copilot-keys-170029734.html"><ins>Aspire</ins></a> lines with the latest Intel Core Ultra chips and Windows AI features. Updates to both lineups seem highly likely at IFA 2025. Don&#39;t be surprised if Acer shows off some more concept devices, too. The company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/acers-project-dualplay-is-a-truly-wild-gaming-laptop-with-a-built-in-controller-130027845.html"><ins>Acer Project DualPlay</ins></a>, a laptop with a detachable game controller, was a big hit at last year&#39;s show, and something the company is bound to top.</p>
<p>When it comes to handheld gaming PCs, Acer&#39;s detailed its plans to sell <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-acer-nitro-blaze-11-is-an-absolutely-massive-handheld-gaming-pc-194505881.html"><ins>three different sizes of handheld</ins></a>, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11, Blaze 8 and Blaze 7, but yet to release them all globally. It might make sense to use IFA 2025 to finalize that and tease whatever it&#39;s working on next.</p>

<p>When it comes to Lenovo, the company has a tried and true playbook for events like IFA. It demoes a slew of new laptops, updates its non-foldable Motorola phones and introduces one or two absolutely bizarre concept devices. The pattern seems like it&#39;ll <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Lenovo;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=59bdf74a-dd5e-49bf-af3d-ef9ab46255e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a02aa910-7539-49e7-bc3a-afb19e0bc931&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Lenovo&amp;linkText=repeat+for+IFA+2025&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW5vdm8uY29tL3VzL2VuL2V2ZW50cy9pbm5vdmF0aW9ud29ybGQvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMDJhYTkxMC03NTM5LTQ5ZTctYmMzYS1hZmIxOWUwYmM5MzEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxlbm92by5jb20vdXMvZW4vZXZlbnRzL2lubm92YXRpb253b3JsZC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAecrIG4YWkDIlKrTb4axniEB1kcJHovhVCVWllcgNnz9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fevents%2Finnovationworld%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/events/innovationworld/"><ins>repeat for IFA 2025</ins></a>.</p>
<p>If the stars of last year&#39;s show were a <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-announces-its-first-16-inch-legion-gaming-laptop-040004058.html"><ins>16-inch Legion gaming laptop</ins></a> and an <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-auto-twist-concept-laptop-has-a-lid-that-can-swivel-and-bow-down-at-your-command-150022971.html"><ins>&quot;Auto Twist&quot; concept</ins></a> that swivels with a voice command, this year Lenovo&#39;s looking at a different kind of rotation. Leaker Evan Blass <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1961175554029203549"><ins>shared images</ins></a> at what looks like a new concept laptop with a display that can be rotated into portrait orientation.

<p>Lenovo has a new handheld PC of its own to announce, too.

<p>According to the event description for <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.ifa-berlin.com/programme/hisense-pc"><ins>Hisense&#39;s IFA 2025 press conference</ins></a>, the company plans to &quot;further upgrade its RGB-MiniLED TV with powerful hardware improvements and AI-driven software.&quot; Hisense introduced the <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-debuts-116-inch-ux-tv-with-rgb-miniled-for-stunning-color-precision"><ins>116-inch UX RGB-MiniLED TV</ins></a> back in July, what the company claims is the first mass-produced television with dedicated red, green and blue LEDs. The approach lets the TV reach a peak brightness of 8,000 nits, among other benefits.</p>
<p>Detailing how much the TV will cost, and what kind of features its &quot;Hi-View AI Engine X&quot; chip will power makes sense.

That likely means Anker&#39;s Eufy or Soundcore brands could be the real focus. Maybe the company has new AI improvements for its Eufy robot vacuums, or audio improvements for its Soundcore headphones? We&#39;ll have to wait for IFA to start to find out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ifa-2025-what-to-expect-from-samsung-acer-lenovo-and-more-181825489.html?src=rss
