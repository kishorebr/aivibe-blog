<p>Mark Zuckerberg has for months <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">publicly hinted</a> that he is backing away from open-source AI models. Now, Meta&#39;s latest AI pivot is starting to come into focus. The company is reportedly working on a new model, known inside of Meta as &quot;Avocado,&quot; which could mark a major shift away from its previous open-source approach to AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>Both <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/meta-avocado-ai-strategy-issues.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">CNBC</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/inside-meta-s-pivot-from-open-source-to-money-making-ai-model" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em> </em>have reported on Meta&#39;s plans surrounding &quot;Avocado,&quot; with both outlets saying the model &quot;could&quot; be proprietary rather than open-source. Avocado, which is due out sometime in 2026, is being worked on inside of &quot;TBD,&quot; a smaller group within Meta&#39;s AI Superintelligence Labs that&#39;s headed up by&nbsp; Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who apparently favors closed models.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear what Avocado could mean for Llama. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said he expected Meta would &quot;continue to be a leader&quot; in open source but that it wouldn&#39;t &quot;open source everything that we do.&quot; He&#39;s also cited safety concerns as they relate to superintelligence.&nbsp;As both <em>CNBC</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> note, Meta&#39;s shift has also been driven by issues surrounding the release of Llama 4. The Llama 4 &quot;Behemoth&quot; model has been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">delayed for months</a>; <em>The New York Times</em> <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-superintelligence-lab-ai.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1">reported</a> earlier this year that Wang and other execs had &quot;discussed abandoning&quot; it altogether. And developers have reportedly been unimpressed with the Llama 4 models that are available.&nbsp;</p><p>There have been other shakeups within the ranks of Meta&#39;s AI groups as Zuckerberg has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">spent billions</a> of dollars building a team dedicated <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">to superintelligence</a>. The company laid off <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/meta-layoffs-ai.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1">several hundred</a> workers from its Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit. And Meta veteran and Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, who has been a proponent for open-source and skeptical of LLMs, recently announced he was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-chief-ai-scientist-is-leaving-the-company-after-12-years-224325268.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">leaving</a> the company.&nbsp;</p><p>That Meta may now be pursuing a closed AI model is a significant shift for Zuckerberg, who just last year said &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-says-fck-that-to-closed-platforms-235700788.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">fuck that</a>&quot; about closed platforms and penned a lengthy memo titled &quot;Open Source AI is the Path Forward.&quot; But the notoriously competitive CEO is also apparently intensely worried about falling behind OpenAI, Google and other rivals. Meta has said it expects to spend <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-will-invest-600-billion-in-the-us-with-ai-data-centers-front-and-center-195000377.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">$600 billion</a> over the next few years to fund its AI ambitions. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ai-model-called-avocado-and-it-might-not-be-open-source-215426778.html?src=rss
