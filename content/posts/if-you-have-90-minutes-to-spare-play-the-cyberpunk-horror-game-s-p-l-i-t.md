<p><em>s.p.l.i.t</em> is the most badass typing game I’ve ever played. It’s actually more of a hacking simulator, cyberpunk thriller and puzzle experience than a typing game, but its core loop is bookended by sequences of high-intensity letter pecking with gruesome consequences — think <em>Mavis Beacon</em> as designed by Ted Kaczynski — and the final scenes have a way of searing themselves into your psyche. Not to mention, the whole thing takes place on a keyboard, no mouse or gamepad. So I guess it’s technically <em>only</em> a typing game, but it’s also not a traditional typing game at all. Trust me, it makes perfect sense in practice.</p>
<p><em>s.p.l.i.t </em>comes from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2433730/Unsorted_Horror/"><em><ins>Unsorted Horror</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?curator_clanid=45275615"><em><ins>Buckshot Roulette</ins></em></a> developer Mike Klubnika, and it features his signature layers of grit, retro hardware and purely concentrated nightmares. In <em>s.p.l.i.t</em>, you’re seated at a ’90s-style computer terminal in a cramped, gray-washed shack. The world appears in PS2-era 3D graphics, and you’re surrounded by distended black screens crawling with orange monospaced text. To your left, a window looks onto a dense forest. To your right, there’s an electronic device in a lockbox. By pressing Alt and A or D, you’re able to twist your torso to interact with two separate screens: One displays an active IRC channel with your co-conspirators, and the other is where the hacking takes place.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="da82252caa77461cb658c55bdf5349b2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3yd6qi9FS0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The narrative unfurls in strings of data logs, file directories, command prompts and instant messages, while a bed of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://mikeklubnika.bandcamp.com/album/s-p-l-i-t-original-soundtrack"><ins>ambient industrial music</ins></a> pulses in hypnotic waves. You’re attempting to gain root access to a facility where mysterious but clearly unethical things are taking place, and you’re working with two colleagues, Sarah and Viktor, to infiltrate the systems. Sarah and Vikor’s messages automatically appear in the chat box, each one accompanied by a satisfying <em>bloop</em> sound, and when it’s your time to respond the SEND button flashes once, prompting you to type. It doesn’t matter which keys you press while chatting, as lines of pre-written dialogue will appear to push the narrative along smoothly. Sarah, Viktor and the player character, Axel, have distinct personalities and they clash in believable ways. The game does a fantastic job of building robust characters in such a short time, through dialogue alone.</p>
<p>On the hacking side, it very much matters which keys you press. You are in full control of the typing while digging through the facility’s files, so spacing, capitalization, punctuation and spelling are all taken into account, alongside use of the proper commands. This portion of the game is a maze of directories and data, operating as one big logic puzzle. Your colleagues outline the goals but once you’re in the system, you’re on your own, relying on context clues to figure out what information you need and how to gain access. The hacking riddles in <em>s.p.l.i.t </em>are perfectly complex, requiring failure and tenacity to work out, and this balance makes each victory feel like a real accomplishment.</p>

<p>Typing “help” at any time pulls up a list of all possible commands, and I found this screen useful whenever I hit a dead end in my investigations — it’s a natural way to mentally reset and visualize any unexplored paths. The “print” command functions as a notepad, allowing you to save relevant numbers and other information on a strip of paper attached to the PC screen, and it’s a useful tool especially in the game’s later stages.</p>
<p>I’m no coder, but I got used to the keyboard style of navigation really quickly. There’s a strong sense of internal logic in <em>s.p.l.i.t</em> and it’s satisfying to play in this sandbox, learning the game’s language and steadily building skills as the narrative tension grows. The first-person interface, rhythmic electronic soundtrack and consistent characters combine to make <em>s.p.l.i.t </em>an incredibly immersive experience. It all pays off in a massive way by the end, when the typing game returns and things really get gruesome.</p>
<p><em>s.p.l.i.t</em> tests critical-thinking skills and keyboard proficiency in a dystopian near-future setting, and it’s a uniquely unnerving, heart-pounding slice of interactive psychological horror. It’s no more than a few hours long, but it’s something you’ll think about for days after the credits roll, guaranteed. <em>s.p.l.i.t</em> is available now <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3684610/split/"><ins>on Steam</ins></a> for just $2.50 through July 31, and $3 after that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/if-you-have-90-minutes-to-spare-play-the-cyberpunk-horror-game-split-120033911.html?src=rss
