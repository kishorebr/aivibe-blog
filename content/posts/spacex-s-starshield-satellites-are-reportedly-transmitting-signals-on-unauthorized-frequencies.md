<p>SpaceX may be violating international telecommunication standards by allowing its Starshield satellites to transmit to Earth on frequencies it&#39;s not supposed to use, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/17/nx-s1-5575254/spacex-starshield-starlink-signal" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>NPR</em> reports</a>. Starshield is a classified version of SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellite network offered on contract to government agencies &quot;to support national security efforts,&quot; according to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.spacex.com/starshield" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">company&#39;s website</a>.</p><p>The report is based on findings from amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley, who observed what appeared to be Starshield satellites broadcasting on frequencies normally dedicated to &quot;uplink&quot; transmissions from the Earth to satellites in orbit. Using the frequencies that way violates <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/sa/R-REC-SA.1154-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">standards</a> set by the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">International Telecommunication Union</a>, a United Nations agency dedicated to coordinating the use of radio spectrum across the world.</p><p>Standards around which frequencies are used for uplink and downlink broadcasts to satellites were created to avoid interference, among other technical issues. &quot;Nearby satellites could receive radio-frequency interference and could perhaps not respond properly to commands — or ignore commands — from Earth,&quot; Tilley told <em>NPR</em>. It&#39;s not clear yet whether SpaceX ignoring these rules is causing any issues with satellite communication, but should problems arise, there&#39;s now a possible cause.</p><p>SpaceX&#39;s first major Starshield project was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-lands-us-space-force-contract-for-starshield-satellite-communications-085045883.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a $70 million contract</a> with US Space Force in 2023.
