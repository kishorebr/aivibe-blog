<p>For most <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-have-brought-down-steam-142116085.html"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> players, the combat is challenging and the boss fights are punishing. However, there&#39;s another layer of complexity for anyone playing the sequel in Simplified Chinese: the bizarre translations. On its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/#app_reviews_hash">Steam store page</a>, <em>Silksong</em> currently sits at a &quot;Mostly Positive&quot; rating across reviews in all languages. Once you filter for the Simplified Chinese reviews, the Metroidvania-style game plummets to &quot;Mostly Negative.&quot;</p>
<p>There are plenty of complaints about <em>Silksong</em> being too hard and not rewarding enough, but the translation issues are a common theme across the reviews for Simplified Chinese. In the reviews and comments, players compared the translations to a jarring mix of ancient and modern Chinese. Tiger Tang, who worked on the Simplified Chinese translation of an indie RPG called <em>OMORI</em>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/TigerHixTang/status/1963850592595677350">posted on X</a> that the &quot;translation reads like a Wuxia novel instead of conveying the gameâ€™s tone,&quot; referencing the literary genre that features martial arts and is often set in ancient China.</p>
