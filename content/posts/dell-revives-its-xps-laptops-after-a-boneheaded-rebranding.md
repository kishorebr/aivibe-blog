<p>Last year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $2,050 and $2,200, respectively. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper prices with lower specs in February.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6/26, 12:30p: </strong>Pricing updated to reflecrt new numbers from Dell. Originally, we were told they would start at $1,650 and $1,850.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html?src=rss
