A startup called Pig.dev that participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch was working on a potentially revolutionary idea: AI agentic tech to control a Microsoft Windows desktop.

But in May, the founder announced he was abandoning the tech and pivoting his company to something entirely different: Muscle Mem, a cache system for AI agents that allows them to offload repeatable tasks. 


	
	




	
	



An early-stage YC company pivoting is nothing out of the ordinary, of course. What’s interesting — and what sparked a dynamic conversation on Thursday’s Y Combinator podcast — is that Pig was working on computer use, one of the big areas that needs to be solved for agents to be truly useful in the workforce. Another company — and another YC alum — that is tackling that for the browser is called Browser Use.

Browser Use surged to popularity when the Chinese agentic tool Manus, which relied on it, went viral. Browser Use essentially scans the buttons and elements of a website to turn them into a more digestible, “text-like” format for agents, helping the AI understand how to navigate and use the website.

During the Y Combinator podcast, released Thursday, partner Tom Blomfield likened Pig to the Browser Use for Windows desktops. The podcast featured Amjad Masad, the founder and CEO of popular vibe-coding startup Replit.

Masad, Blomfield, and YC partner David Lieb were discussing how long-term computer use of hours, rather than minutes, was still a stumbling block for agents. As the context window for reasoning grows, an agent’s accuracy wavers while LLM costs increase.

“The advice I would give founders today is taking either Browser Use or Windows automation with Pig and trying to apply that into enterprise, into a vertical industry,” Blomfield suggested.
