It is relatively pricey however, and the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-vs-apple-watch-series-11-how-do-they-compare-120140064.html">Watch SE 3</a> is probably enough for most users, but the Series 11 has a brighter and larger display, a thinner design, longer battery life and more advanced health features.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch Series 11 is available on Amazon in all sizes, colors and connectivity options. There are a few case color and band combinations that are $10 off Apple's base price.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-apple-watch-series-11-gets-its-first-discount-135020658.html?src=rss
