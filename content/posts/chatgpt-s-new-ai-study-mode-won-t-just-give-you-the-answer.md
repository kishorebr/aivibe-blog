<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI is adding a new study mode for ChatGPT that “helps you work through problems step by step instead of just getting an answer,” according to <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/">an OpenAI blog post</a>. It will be available today for ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users and for ChatGPT Edu users “in the next few weeks.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you ask a question with study mode turned on, ChatGPT can give you interactive prompts that combine “Socratic questioning, hints, and self-reflection prompts” to help you learn about your question. OpenAI also says that study mode responses will be organized “into easy-to-follow sections that highlight the key connections between topics” and that lessons will be tailored to users based on “questions that assess skill level and memory from previous chats.” Study mode can give quizzes, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI companies are increasingly competing for the attention of college students, with OpenAI rival Anthropic introducing its own “Learning mode” feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/641193/openai-anthropic-education-tool-college">for Claude in April</a>. Tools like study mode could encourage students to use ChatGPT for learning instead of easy answers. But since users are able to turn off study mode at their own discretion, they’ll have to motivate themselves to actually use the feature instead of relying on ChatGPT to spit out a response or <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html?isNewSocialUser=false&amp;providerId=google.com">using the AI chatbot to cheat</a>. (At the moment, OpenAI doesn’t have tools for parents or administrators to force students to stay in study mode, VP of education Leah Belsky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/">told <em>TechCrunch</em></a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI says that study mode is powered by “custom system instructions” the company wrote with teachers, scientists, and pedagogy experts. OpenAI picked custom instructions because it lets the company “quickly learn from real student feedback and improve the experience — even if it results in some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations.” Down the line, OpenAI says it plans to add clearer visualizations, goal setting across conversations, and “deeper personalization.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google also announced new features for some of its AI tools today that could be useful for students. AI Mode in Search is getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715218/google-ai-mode-image-upload-canvas-update-students">a new canvas mode</a> that can help you make things like study guides, while NotebookLM’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715283/google-notebooklm-video-overviews-studio-ai">Video Overviews feature</a> uses AI to create slideshows with narration.</p>
