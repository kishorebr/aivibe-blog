<p>Fans will have to wait a little bit longer for the hotly-anticipated <em>Balatro</em> 1.1 update. Developer LocalThunk just announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">it will not be coming out in 2025</a>, despite previously promising a release this year. Instead, it&#39;ll come out &quot;when it&#39;s done.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth remembering that <em>Balatro</em> was created by a single person, and the same goes for this update. The lone developer also made the original balance patch and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-is-an-almost-perfect-mobile-port-163050971.html">well-regarded mobile port</a>. He says he&#39;s &quot;well and truly burned out.&quot;</p>

<p>LocalThunk apologizes for the delay and says &quot;it has become clear now that it won&#39;t happen by the end of the year.&quot; It&#39;s actually nice to let us know now instead of forcing us to wonder where the update is for the next several months.</p>
<p>&quot;I still consider this my hobby,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Now for some good news. The update is definitely coming, just not right now. It&#39;ll be free for all players on all platforms. The developer also hinted that this update would not be the final DLC drop for the game.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Balatro</em> is a deckbuilding roguelike that&#39;s loosely based on poker. Consider it the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html">highly addictive sequel to poker</a> we never knew we needed. It has proven to be a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-is-about-to-hook-a-lot-more-players-now-that-its-on-game-pass-192958603.html">bona-fide phenomenon</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatros-big-2025-update-wont-be-coming-out-this-year-after-all-183511401.html?src=rss
