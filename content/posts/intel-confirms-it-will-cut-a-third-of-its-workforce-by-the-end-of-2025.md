<p>Intel provided more detail about the scope of its planned job cuts and other business changes while sharing its second-quarter earnings <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1745/intel-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results"><ins>results</ins></a>.

Today, the chipmaker said it anticipates having a core workforce of 75,000 employees by the end of 2025. That&#39;s about a third less than the 108,900 people it employed at the close of the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>These cuts are part of the company&#39;s current goal to bring its non-GAAP operating expenses down to $17 billion this year, then to $16 billion at the end of 2026. The effort to rein in spending is also leading Intel to abandon some previously announced expansions. The business will no longer embark on new projects in Germany and Poland, and it said it will consolidate its Costa Rican testing and assembly operations into existing efforts in Vietnam and Malaysia. Finally, it will also &quot;slow the pace&quot; of its stateside growth at a construction site in Ohio.</p>
