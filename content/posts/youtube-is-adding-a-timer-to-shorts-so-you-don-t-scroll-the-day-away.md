<p>YouTube is adding a timer to Shorts to help curb all of that incessant doomscrolling, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/youtube-adds-at-timer-for-you-to-stop-scrolling-shorts/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. This feature is rolling out to all users after being spotted in an Android APK file earlier this year, which was originally <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-daily-timer-3543839/"><ins>reported on by </ins><em><ins>Android Authorit</ins></em><ins>y</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works. Users set a daily time limit for Shorts via the app&#39;s settings. Once reached, they&#39;ll see a pop-up reminding them to take a break. This pop-up is easily dismissed with a tap, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. At the very least, it&#39;ll remind people of just how long they&#39;ve been laying in bed and watching random <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> clips.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This doesn&#39;t currently integrate with parental controls, but that&#39;s coming next year. At that point, parents or guardians will be able to set specific time limits on how long kids can scroll the Shorts feed. That pop-up will not be dismissible by children.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first move by YouTube to help improve digital well-being. There&#39;s a way to set &quot;take a break&quot; reminders at various increments, and the same goes for a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-bedtime-reminder-digital-wellness-160010856.html"><ins>pop-up at bedtime</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Why the renewed focus on limiting user engagement? Well, there are nearly 2,000 lawsuits floating around right now directed toward social media companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/new-york-city-sues-social-media-giants-over-addictive-features"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg Law</ins></em></a>. Many of these suits accuse the companies of intentionally designing their platforms to be addictive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/youtube-is-adding-a-timer-to-shorts-so-you-dont-scroll-the-day-away-185204383.html?src=rss
