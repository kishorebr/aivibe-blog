<p class="has-text-align-none">Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is threatening Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta with a deceptive business practices claim because their AI chatbots allegedly listed Donald Trump last on a request to &#8220;rank the last five presidents from best to worst, specifically regarding antisemitism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bailey&#8217;s <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/attorney-general-bailey-fights-to-expose-big-tech-censorship-of-president-trump-as-ai-chatbots-produce-fake-news/">press release</a> and letters <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.09-Google-LLC-Sndar-Pichai-Letter.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.09-Microsoft-Satya-Nadella-Letter.pdf">all</a> <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.09-OpenAI-Sam-Altman-Letter.pdf">four</a> <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.09-Meta-Properties-Inc.-Mark-Zuckerbrg-Letter.pdf">companies</a> accuse Gemini, Copilot, ChatGPT, and Meta AI of making &#8220;factually inaccurate&#8221; claims to &#8220;simply ferret out facts from the vast worldwide web, package them into statements of truth and serve them up to the inquiring public free from distortion or bias,&#8221; because the chatbots &#8220;provided deeply misleading answers to a straightforward historical question.&#8221; He&#8217;s demanding a slew of information that includes &#8220;all documents&#8221; involving &#8220;prohibiting, delisting, down ranking, suppressing … or otherwise obscuring any particular input in order to produce a deliberately curated response&#8221; — a request that could logically include virtually every piece of documentation regarding large language model training.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;The puzzling responses beg the question of why your chatbot is producing results that appear to disregard objective historical facts in favor of a particular narrative,&#8221; Bailey&#8217;s letters state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are, in fact, a lot of puzzling questions here, starting with how a ranking of anything &#8220;from best to worst&#8221; can be considered a &#8220;straightforward historical question&#8221; with an objectively correct answer. (<em>The Verge</em> looks forward to Bailey&#8217;s formal investigation of our picks for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">2025&#8217;s best laptops</a> and the best games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/680659/day-of-the-devs-2025-summer-game-fest">last month&#8217;s Day of the Devs</a>.) Chatbots spit out factually false claims so frequently that it&#8217;s either extremely brazen or unbelievably lazy to hang an already tenuous investigation on a subjective statement of opinion that was <em>deliberately requested</em> by a user.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The choice is even more incredible because one of the services — Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot — appears to have been falsely accused. Bailey&#8217;s investigation is built on a <a href="https://mrcfreespeechamerica.org/blogs/free-speech/gabriela-pariseau/2025/06/26/find-out-where-six-ai-rank-trump-last-five">blog post</a> from a conservative website that posed the ranking question to six chatbots, including the four above plus X&#8217;s Grok and the Chinese LLM DeepSeek. (Both of those apparently ranked Trump first.) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/10/missouri-ag-any-ai-that-doesnt-praise-donald-trump-might-be-consumer-fraud-no-really/">As <em>Techdirt</em> points out</a>, the site itself says Copilot refused to produce a ranking —&nbsp;which didn&#8217;t stop Bailey from sending a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella demanding an explanation for slighting Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;d think somebody at Bailey&#8217;s office might have noticed this, because each of the four letters claims that only <em>three</em> chatbots &#8220;​​rated President Donald Trump dead last.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Bailey is saying that &#8220;Big Tech Censorship Of President Trump&#8221; (again, by ranking him last on a list) should strip the companies of &#8220;the &#8216;safe harbor&#8217; of immunity provided to neutral publishers in federal law&#8221;, which is presumably a reference to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act filtered through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview">nonsense legal theory</a> that&#8217;s been floating around for several years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You may remember Bailey from <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/angelo-carusone/media-matters-statement-winning-injunction-against-missouri-ag-andrew-bailey">his blocked probe into Media Matters</a> for accusing Elon Musk&#8217;s X of placing ads on pro-Nazi content, and it&#8217;s highly possible this investigation will go nowhere. Meanwhile, there are entirely reasonable questions about a chatbot&#8217;s legal liability for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755057/openai-chatgpt-false-information-defamation-lawsuit">pushing defamatory lies</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/624209/chatgpt-ethics-specs-humanism">which subjective queries</a> it should answer. But even as a Trump-friendly publicity grab, this is an undisguised attempt to intimidate private companies for failing to sufficiently flatter a politician, by an attorney general whose math skills are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/why-is-chatgpt-so-bad-at-math/">worse than ChatGPT&#8217;s</a>.</p>
