<p>China wants to work with other countries and has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/de06e1ac-6a12-45a4-a31c-0dfecea4343e">laid out its plans</a> for the global governance of artificial intelligence at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai. Li Qiang, the country&#39;s premier, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/26/china-calls-for-global-ai-cooperation-days-after-trump-administration-unveils-low-regulation-strategy">warned</a> about &quot;technological monopolies&quot; and said that AI could become &quot;an exclusive game for a few countries and companies.&quot; As such, he proposed the creation of a &quot;world AI cooperation organization&quot; during the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li didn&#39;t specifically mention the United States when he talked about monopolies, but the US restricts AI chip exports to his country. NVIDIA had to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html">develop chips</a> that are only meant for China and conform to export rules so it wouldn&#39;t lose the Chinese market completely. Meanwhile, Chinese companies like Huawei are <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/huawei-shows-off-ai-computing-system-rival-nvidias-top-product-2025-07-26/">developing their own</a> AI systems to make up for China&#39;s lack of access to more advanced AI chips from American firms. Li also made the statement a few days after the Trump administration <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/trumps-ai-action-plan-targets-state-regulation-and-ideological-bias-163247225.html">revealed its AI Action Plan</a>, which seeks to limit state regulation of AI companies and which aims to ensure that the US can beat China in the AI race.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Chinese premier said his country would &quot;actively promote&quot; the development of open source artificial intelligence and that China is &quot;willing to provide more Chinese solutions to the international community&quot; when it comes to AI. He also said that his country was eager to share AI technologies with developing countries in the global south.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, overall global AI governance is still fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas such as regulatory concepts [and] institutional rules,&quot; Li said. &quot;We should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-calls-for-the-creation-of-a-global-ai-organization-160005350.html?src=rss
