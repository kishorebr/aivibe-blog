Google believes its new algorithm is further proof of that assumption. The Quantum Echoes algorithm is able to illustrate how different parts of a quantum system interact with each other, in a way that&#39;s repeatable by other quantum computers and that &quot;runs 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;echo&quot; in Quantum Echoes comes from how Google&#39;s algorithm interacts with a quantum system, in this case the Willow chip. &quot;We send a carefully crafted signal into our quantum system (qubits on Willow chip), perturb one qubit, then precisely reverse the signal’s evolution to listen for the &#39;echo&#39; that comes back,&quot; the company explained in its announcement blog. That echo is magnified by the &quot;constructive interference&quot; of quantum waves, making the measurement Google is able to take extremely sensitive.</p><p>That sensitivity suggests quantum computers could be an important tool in modeling things like the interaction of particles or the structure of molecules. In a separate experiment with the University of California, Berkeley, Google tried to prove that by running the Quantum Echoes algorithm to study two different molecules, and comparing it to the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method currently used by scientists to understand chemical structure. The results from both systems matched, and Google says Quantum Echoes even &quot;revealed information not usually available from NMR.&quot;</p><p>In the longterm, a full-scale quantum computer could be used for everything from drug discovery to the development of new battery components. For now though, Google believes its Quantum Echoes research means real-world quantum computer applications could arrive within the next five years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/google-says-it-made-a-breakthrough-toward-practical-quantum-computing-183502245.html?src=rss
