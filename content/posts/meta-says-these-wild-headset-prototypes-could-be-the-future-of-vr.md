<p>Meta <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/reality-labs-research-tiramisu-boba-3-siggraph-2025-ultrawide-fov-hyperrealistic-vr/"><ins>previewed</ins></a> some of its latest virtual reality prototypes this week, with concepts that are compelling on the specs and long on the design. Literally. The company shared some details on its Tiramisu project, dubbing it &quot;hyperrealistic VR.&quot; This set promises three times the contrast, 14 times the maximum brightness and 3.6 times the angular resolution of the Meta Quest 3. In actual stats, that&#39;s up to 1,400 nits of brightness and an angular resolution of 90 pixels per degree.</p>
<p>One of the goals for Reality Labs Researchâ€™s Optics, Photonics and Light Systems (OPALS) team is to create a virtual reality experience that is indistinguishable from the real world, or what it calls a visual Turing test. &quot;Our mission for this project was to provide the best image quality possible,&quot; said Xuan Wang, an optical research scientist with OPALS. But the team achieved that quality with some tradeoffs; Tiramisu has a limited field of view of just 33 degrees by 33 degrees compared to the 110 degrees horizontal and 96 degrees vertical FOV in the Meta Quest 3. And the form factor is currently a pretty bulky beast, as you can see above.</p>

<p>The other prototypes detailed in the company&#39;s blog post are Boba 3 headsets. These mixed and virtual reality headsets offer an ultrawide field of view. All three projects will be on display during the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver next week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-says-these-wild-headset-prototypes-could-be-the-future-of-vr-225132683.html?src=rss
