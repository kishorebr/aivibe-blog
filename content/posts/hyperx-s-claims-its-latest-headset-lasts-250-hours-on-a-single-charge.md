<p>HyperX has announced its latest flagship wireless gaming headset, and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyperx-cloud-alpha-gaming-headset-ces-2022-181018444.html"><ins>once again</ins></a>, the brand’s primary mission statement seems to be chasing eternal life for headphone batteries. The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-cloud-alpha-2-wireless-gaming-headset"><ins>Cloud Alpha 2</ins></a> will last, according to its maker, for up to 250 hours on a full charge.</p>
<p>While that number halves if you make use of the headsets’s simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity, a more than 10-day battery life is impressive for any wireless headset. Its new multi-layer 53mm drivers are engineered to reduce distortion as much as possible, while spatial audio is supported via HyperX’s Ngenuity software.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Cloud Alpha 2 isn’t actually the longest-lasting headset HyperX has made. The honor still belongs to its 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyperx-cloud-alpha-gaming-headset-ces-2022-181018444.html"><ins>predecessor</ins></a>, which could last for up to 300 hours on a single charge. On paper, losing 50 hours of battery life on a newer headset could be viewed as a disappointment, but the Cloud Alpha 2’s ace card is its eye-catching RGB base station. With its colorful programmable buttons and pleasingly chunky-looking dial, you can tweak audio settings, launch shortcuts, adjust the volume and switch between connected devices. HyperX says the control station is the first of its kind on a wireless gaming headset.</p>
<p>The Cloud Alpha 2 is compatible with PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Mac and mobile devices wireless over a 2.4Ghz connection, as well as Xbox provided you’re happy to go wired. It comes with a detachable 10mm boom mic, but you won’t find any active noise-canceling tech built in. HyperX promises all-day comfort from breathable microfiber earpads and the memory foam support around the steel headband</p>
<p>The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 headset costs $300 and is available now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyperxs-claims-its-latest-headset-lasts-250-hours-on-a-single-charge-155125206.html?src=rss
