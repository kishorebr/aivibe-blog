The game's price first came into question when its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-up-to-september-12-154958162.html">September 12 release date</a> was announced without pre-order details, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggested that whether the game came with a $80 price tag was out of his hands.</p>
<p>Pitchford put his foot in his mouth in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922406958813835584">a thread on X</a> sharing a behind-the-scenes video about bringing <em>Borderlands 4 </em>to the Switch 2. A fan replied to the video asking Pitchford to not charge $80 for the game, to which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">Pitchford responded</a>, "A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="21110e0716434481a6e272ec06c615c1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>Naturally, that came off as a bit glib to anyone surprised by the sudden emergence of $80 games following the release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-perfect-launch-game-for-the-switch-2-130003924.html"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a><em>. </em>Pitchford didn't exactly double-down next, but at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mvsx1FzIKEg?si=2ArxJpEdYBIOmROE&amp;t=3732">a PAX East panel later in May</a>, he also didn't deny the game would have a higher price, noting that "<em>Borderlands 4</em> has more than twice the development budget than <em>Borderlands 3.</em>"</p>
<p>The official pre-order information settles things: the game is not going the way of Mario Kart. The Standard Edition of <em>Borderlands 4</em> costs $70 and comes with free Vault Hunter, weapon and drone skins if you pre-order. If you step up to the $100 Deluxe Edition, you get even more skins and a "Bounty Pack Bundle" that includes exclusive areas and weapons. For the $130 Super Deluxe Edition, you get all of that plus the "Vault Hunter Pack," which includes the game's two story DLC packs and new playable characters. A $70 game is not a $60 game, but if price is your biggest concern, it's better than $80.</p>
<p>Gearbox plans to show off more of <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s story and gameplay at Borderlands Fan Fest on June 21. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X / S and PC on September 12. The Switch 2 release is scheduled for 2025, too, and Gearbox plans to share more information about it at a later date.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/borderlands-4-will-not-cost-80-despite-misguided-executive-comments-205622443.html?src=rss
