<p>The astronauts part of SpaceX&#39;s Crew-10 mission are <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/08/08/dragon-undocks-crew-10-departs-station-for-earth-return/">on their way back home</a>. Their Dragon capsule called Endurance is scheduled to splash down at approximately 11:33 AM Eastern time off the coast of California. Endurance undocked from the International Space Station at 6:15PM Eastern on August 8 with NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov onboard. They stayed on the ISS for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-crew-10-mission-is-on-its-way-to-the-iss-133045695.html">five months</a> and left a week after Crew-11 arrived to take their place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they were on the space station, Crew-10 helped expand our knowledge on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8413">physiological and psychological changes</a> humans undergo on long-duration missions that range from weeks to a year. They also observed how blood flows from the brain to the heart <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8776">in microgravity</a>, among the other studies and experiments they conducted.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As NASA notes, this will be its first Commercial Crew mission to splash down into the Pacific Ocean, as previous capsules splashed down off the coast of Florida. NASA will broadcast the crew&#39;s return, with its coverage starting at 10:15AM today, August 9. You can watch Endurance splash down into the ocean on NASA+ or on the YouTube video embedded below. NASA will also hold a teleconference after retrieving the astronauts and will broadcast the event <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.nasa.gov/live/">on its website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
