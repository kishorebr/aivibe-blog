On Monday, Clio, a 17-year-old Canadian law firm management software company, announced that it has agreed to acquire vLex, a 26-year-old legal data intelligence platform, in a $1 billion cash-and-stock deal.

The announcement comes about a year after Clio’s massive $900 million funding round, which nearly doubled the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company’s valuation from $1.6 billion in 2021 to $3 billion.


	
	




	
	



vLex, which was largely bootstrapped until it was purchased by private equity firm Oakley Capital in 2022, has been a highly sought-after asset, according to Jack Newton, CEO and founder of Clio.

Harvey, the AI-native legal tech startup, attempted to purchase vLex a year ago, but the acquisition didn’t come together, as reported by The Information last July.  

vLex is a valuable property because its database of legal documents can greatly improve AI models for lawyers.

“Data is one of the only long-term defensible competitive moats a company can have in the space,” Newton told TechCrunch.

vLex competes with the Thomson Reuters-owned legal database and LexisNexis. The acquisition comes shortly after Harvey announced a partnership with LexisNexis, aiming to enrich Harvey’s AI with LexisNexis data.
