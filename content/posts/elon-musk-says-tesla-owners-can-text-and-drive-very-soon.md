<p>Elon Musk went on stage on Thursday night during <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation-package-233217531.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Tesla’s</a> annual shareholders <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://livestream.tesla.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">meeting</a> and made some big claims and promises. The company is “almost comfortable” letting owners with Full Self-Driving (FSD) “text and drive,” he said. At the moment, its vehicles are still strictly monitoring drivers to make sure their eyes are on the road, but Musk said that Tesla will enable unsupervised FSD that will allow texting and driving within “a month or two.”  </p><p>To note, Tesla’s FSD is currently capable of level 2 autonomous driving. Musk is promising at least a level 4 capability, in which the driver can be disengaged as the car performs all driving tasks for them, within a short span of time. While he said that Tesla will look at its safety data first, he didn’t discuss the steps it’s taking to enable texting while driving and whether it’s already discussing the legalities of it with regulators. </p><p>Talking about the Cybercab, Musk said production of the robotaxis will begin by April next year. Since it will be specifically built with autonomy in mind, it will not have pedals, a steering wheel and even side mirrors. The Cybercab’s manufacturing process, he explained, is vastly different from typical car production and is more comparable to phone manufacturing. That’s why he thinks the company will be able to produce one unit every 10 seconds.</p><p>Musk also talked about the flying car he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/elon-musk-teases-a-flying-car-on-joe-rogans-show-120022824.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">teased on Joe Rogan’s show</a>. When asked at the event, he said the demo will now take place on April 1, 2026, instead of this month or the next like he told Rogan. It remains to be seen whether we’re going to get April Fooled, but Musk claimed that production of Tesla’s flying vehicle will happen a year or so after its unveiling. As always, take Musk’s claims with a grain of salt, as he’s pretty infamous for being overly ambitious with his timelines. </p><p>While Musk was on stage talking about Tesla’s plans, an Optimus humanoid robot was standing by the side. The CEO said Optimus is bound to become the “biggest product of all time,” bigger than cellphones, “bigger than anything.” Tesla will start with a 1-million production line and then a 10-million production line, but he said the company expects to eventually produce 100 million to a billion Optimus robots a year. He envisions a world wherein the humanoid machines will provide people with medical care… as well as a world wherein instead of being jailed, Optimus follows criminals around to stop them from committing more crimes. </p><p>Before Musk went on stage, Tesla’s shareholders had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation-package-233217531.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">voted to approve</a> his pay package worth up to $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Tesla has to hit several goals for Musk to become the first trillionaire, though, including reaching a market value of $8.5 trillion from its current worth of  $1.4 billion and selling a million Optimus robots. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-says-tesla-owners-can-text-and-drive-very-soon-042454805.html?src=rss
