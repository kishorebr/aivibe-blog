<p>One of Tesla's fully autonomous robotaxis grazed a parked car after completing a ride recently in Austin, Texas. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/N2l2KcwBXZ8?si=IPJgorXycXyKGbdc&amp;t=295">video recorded</a> by YouTuber DirtyTesla, a self-driving Model Y is seen turning and accelerating into a Toyota, making light contact with its tire. As seen in the video, the Model Y already dropped off its passenger, but had trouble navigating out of the dark alleyway afterwards. Tesla's robotaxi service <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/teslas-first-robotaxi-rides-are-already-running-into-a-few-bumps-205308245.html">launched in Austin</a> just two weeks ago with a small fleet.</p>
<p>According to DirtyTesla, there were no serious injuries or damages and the robotaxi's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-inaugural-robotaxi-rides-will-have-a-human-safety-monitor-on-board-161307639.html">safety monitor</a> eventually swapped to the driver's seat and drove off. Although the sideswipe was minor, it's unclear what caused the Tesla to drive into the parked car instead of driving off normally after completing the ride.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside this incident involving another car, other invited guests have shared their unexpected experiences with Tesla's robotaxi service. So far, we've seen the robotaxi service abruptly stop for emergency lights that aren't on the road and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1936922325808562343">briefly drive</a> on the wrong side of a double yellow line. It's important to note that Tesla's self-driving software relies mostly on cameras and artificial intelligence. That's unlike some of its competition, like Waymo, which uses a combination of cameras, lidar and radar for its robotaxi service. However, Waymo isn't without its own incidents, one of which led to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issues-recall-after-one-its-self-driving-taxis-crashed-into-a-pole-121937607.html">voluntary recall</a> of its fleet in Phoenix, Arizona, following a collision with a telephone pole last year. More recently, Waymo issued <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/alphabets-waymo-recalls-over-1200-vehicles-after-collisions-with-roadway-2025-05-14/">another recall</a> for its robotaxis, which were reportedly prone to hit roadway barriers that are harder to see.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-tesla-robotaxi-inexplicably-drove-into-a-parked-car-171004400.html?src=rss
