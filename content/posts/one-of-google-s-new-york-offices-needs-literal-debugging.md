<p>Bed bugs: the nightmare of any city dweller, frequent traveler, and now Google employee. The team at the company&#39;s Chelsea campus were notified on Sunday that a possible bed bug infestation had been discovered in the building and were told to remain at home so the location could be treated. As if working over the weekend wasn&#39;t enough of a bummer. Fortunately, exterminators collected their bug bounty, and employees were allowed to return to the building on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Google told employees to file a report if they had symptoms of bed bug bites or saw evidence of bed bugs on site, according to an email sent by the company and obtained by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-beg-bug-infestation-at-googles-manhattan-offices/"><em>Wired</em></a>. They were also told to contact professional exterminators if they accidentally brought bed bugs home; hopefully Google foots the bill for those unlucky people.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <em>Wired</em>&#39;s sources, the infestation may have been caused by &quot;a number of large stuffed animals&quot; in the Google office, but the publication wasn&#39;t able to confirm that. It&#39;s always the ones you least suspect.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/one-of-googles-new-york-offices-needs-literal-debugging-194029103.html?src=rss
