<p>Amazon is making its satellite communication network a bit more official with a rebrand. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-leo/project-kuiper-becomes-amazon-leo" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that Project Kuiper will now be called &quot;Amazon Leo,&quot; a nod to the fact that its network is composed of satellites in low Earth orbit.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Kuiper&#39;s journey to becoming a proper Amazon brand has been a long one. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-04-amazon-internet-satellite-network-project-kuiper.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">introduced the project</a> in 2019 with the goal of offering internet in regions without a reliable connection, through a proposed constellation of over 3,000 satellites that could blanket 95 percent of the global population in high-speed internet. That constellation has yet to fully take shape, however. In the years following the Project Kuiper reveal, Amazon launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-internet-satellite-launch-was-a-success-202130763.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">prototype satellites</a>, detailed plans for a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-boosts-its-satellite-internet-network-with-the-help-of-space-lasers-123535946.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">space laser mesh network</a> and showed off <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-satellite-internet-antennas-can-double-as-picnic-tables-for-dolls-153450879.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the antennas</a> customers will use to connect to its network, but it didn&#39;t actually <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-deploys-the-first-project-kuiper-internet-satellites-140006298.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">launch the first 27 satellites</a> in its constellation until April 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, its competitor Starlink has had a much faster expansion. SpaceX launched the Starlink satellite internet service in beta in 2020, and has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">rapidly expanded it</a> since then. Now SpaceX has a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/t-mobile-is-offering-its-starlink-satellite-texting-feature-for-free-until-july-130044054.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">deal with T-Mobile</a> for satellite-enabled texting, and has struck up partnerships with airlines to test or offer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">internet connection on flights</a>. Rebranding Project Kuiper to Leo suggests Amazon is finally ready to think about its satellite network as a product in its own right, but the company still has some catching up to do.</p><p>Amazon hasn&#39;t shared a date for when its satellite internet service will be widely available for personal and commercial use, but you can sign-up on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://leo.amazon.com/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Amazon Leo website</a> to receive updates as the company works towards launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html?src=rss
