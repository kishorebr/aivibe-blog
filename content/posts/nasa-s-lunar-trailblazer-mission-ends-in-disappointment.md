<p>The Lunar Trailblazer mission to the moon officially ended on July 31, but it wasn&#39;t a complete journey. NASA <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/lunar-trailblazer/nasas-lunar-trailblazer-moon-mission-ends/"><ins>said</ins></a> today that its teams lost contact with the satellite shortly after its launch several months prior.</p>
<p>The NASA satellite was part of the IM-2 mission by Intuitive Machines, which took off from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center on February 26 at 7:16PM ET. The Lunar Trailblazer successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 48 minutes after launch. Operators in Pasadena, CA established communication with the satellite at 8:13PM ET, but two-way communication was lost the next day and the team was unable to recover the connection. From the limited data ground teams received before the satellite went dark, the craft&#39;s solar arrays were not correctly positioned toward the sun, which caused its batteries to drain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;While it was not the outcome we had hoped for, mission experiences like Lunar Trailblazer help us to learn and reduce the risk for future, low-cost small satellites to do innovative science as we prepare for a sustained human presence on the Moon,&quot; said Nicky Fox, associate administrator at NASA Headquarters&#39; Science Mission Directorate. &quot;Thank you to the Lunar Trailblazer team for their dedication in working on and learning from this mission through to the end.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lunar Trailblazer mission was one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/2025-is-going-to-be-another-big-year-for-commercial-moon-missions-160038622.html"><ins>several commercial spaceflights</ins></a> planned for travel to the moon during 2025. Its goal was to create high-resolution maps of any water on the moon&#39;s surface, as well as assessing how much water was present, in what forms and how it may have changed over time. Fingers crossed the remaining missions have better success.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasas-lunar-trailblazer-mission-ends-in-disappointment-201318932.html?src=rss
