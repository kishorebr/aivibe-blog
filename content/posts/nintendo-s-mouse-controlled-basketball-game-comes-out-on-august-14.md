<p>Nintendo just revealed that <em>Drag x Drive</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1937499572453913057"><ins>will be available on August 14</ins></a>, exclusively for the recently-released <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/"><ins>Switch 2 console</ins></a>. The company made this announcement on its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-today-app-will-provide-updates-on-games-events-and-the-switch-2-150808151.html"><ins>Today! news app</ins></a>.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Drag x Drive</em> is a 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game. The main hook is that it&#39;s controlled <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-joy-cons-can-double-as-mouse-like-controllers-133355339.html"><ins>via the mouse-like functionality</ins></a> of those new Joy-Con controllers. This will be the first major test of this feature and will let us know if it&#39;ll be a barely-used gimmick or a real opportunity for new gameplay experiences.</p>

<p>The game looks pretty fun, though it will likely be something of a niche title. Think <em>Arms</em> and not <em>Wii Sports</em>. We don&#39;t have a price yet and it remains to be seen if the concept is robust enough to charge $60 or $70. My guess is that it&#39;ll come somewhere in the $30 to $40 range.</p>
<p>This does, however, prove one thing. Nintendo is trying to release a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-monthly-release-make-sense-mario-kart-world-launch/"><ins>first-party game each month</ins></a>, which is something it did during much of the lifecycle of the original Switch. The new console launched with <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-revealed-pauline-as-a-surprise-character-in-donkey-kong-bananza-165132377.html"><ins>comes out on July 17</ins></a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, the next big Switch 2 exclusive co-stars Pauline from the original arcade game and looks like an absolute blast. DK gets to eat giant, golden bananas and destroy everything in his sight. It could also very well be a prequel to both the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, given Pauline&#39;s age in <em>Bananza</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-mouse-controlled-basketball-game-comes-out-on-august-14-163200335.html?src=rss
