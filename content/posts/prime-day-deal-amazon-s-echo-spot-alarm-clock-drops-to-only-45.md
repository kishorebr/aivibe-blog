<p>If you’re looking to replace your old alarm clock with an Alexa-powered modern <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html">smart</a> alternative then, well, you’re more overwhelmed with options than ever. But a $35 saving on last year’s updated <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0BFC7WQ6R&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ca0ec883-874e-466d-835b-3ec1daef6bbe&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Echo+Spot&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FtYXpvbi1FY2hvLVNwb3QtMjAyNC1yZWxlYXNlLVNtYXJ0LWFsYXJtLWNsb2NrLXdpdGgtdmlicmFudC1zb3VuZC1BbGV4YS1CbGFjay9kcC9CMEJGQzdXUTZSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNhMGVjODgzLTg3NGUtNDY2ZC04MzViLTNlYzFkYWVmNmJiZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbWF6b24tRWNoby1TcG90LTIwMjQtcmVsZWFzZS1TbWFydC1hbGFybS1jbG9jay13aXRoLXZpYnJhbnQtc291bmQtQWxleGEtQmxhY2svZHAvQjBCRkM3V1E2UiIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVhY7Pqh_Pj_cq6wG0Gmm0d0gEJhsBFN2bjgYt4tf5HV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black%2Fdp%2FB0BFC7WQ6R" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?th=1">Echo Spot</a> might make your decision a bit easier.</p> 
<p>The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-revives-the-echo-spot-smart-alarm-clock-and-swiftly-discounts-it-by-44-percent-160304634.html">introduced</a> in July 2024, and this matches its record-low price. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="08802cc496484a38aa201dc5a03ca95b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too.</p> 
<p>Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-2023-echo-show-is-faster-and-offers-improved-audio-140027400.html">Echo Show 5</a>. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best.</p> 
<p>Amazon’s Prime Day sale returns on October 7, so you can expect a range of deals on its various Echo devices.
