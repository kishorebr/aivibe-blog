That also means that it's difficult to keep track of new product launches -- but GPT-5 is one you'll want to keep an eye out for. Here's why. Also: OpenAI teases imminent GPT-5 launch. Here's what to expectWhen OpenAI CEO Sam Altman teased GPT-5 in February, he gave a glimpse into the model's best feature: the ability to pick the best model to automatically answer your specific queries. This will be done by unifying the o-series reasoning models, which produce higher-quality answers, with the GPT-series models, which are more time-efficient, eliminating guesswork on the user's end. "The plan is to unify all of these ideas into something like GPT-5  such that you just ask it a question and it needs to think of things, very much like when you talk to a human; sometimes it will think before responding, sometimes it will respond immediately, sometimes it'll respond and keep thinking," said Nick Turley, Head of ChatGPT to ZDNET.  How will this make your life easier?It is no secret that the OpenAI models available on the market can sound like a bit of an alphabet soup, with similar-sounding models, like GPT-4o and o4, which are each best suited to different tasks. This makes it difficult to kee
