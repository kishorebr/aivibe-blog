<p>Grokipedia, the encyclopedia powered by xAI&#39;s assistant Grok briefly went online Monday, before it promptly crashed. At the time of this writing, the website appears to be working, and contains more than 885,000 articles, according to a counter on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://grokipedia.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">its homepage</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk, who has previously <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/elon-musk-also-has-a-problem-with-wikipedia" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">railed against</a> Wikipedia, has described the project as a &quot;a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the Universe.&quot; Musk and his allies have long claimed that Wikipedia is biased. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/wikipedia-founder-responds-to-elon-musk-wokepedia" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">has called</a> Musk&#39;s claims about the crowd-sourced encyclopedia &quot;factually incorrect.&quot;&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are building Grokipedia <a href="https://twitter.com/xai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@xAI</a>. <br><br>Will be a massive improvement over Wikipedia.<br><br>Frankly, it is a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the Universe. <a href="https://t.co/xvSeWkpALy">https://t.co/xvSeWkpALy</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1972992095859433671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

Such entries do have a small disclaimer that “the content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License.”</p><p>In other cases, social media users have already spotted instances where Musk’s worldview is more obvious in the &quot;AI-powered encyclopedia.&quot; Here&#39;s an excerpt from the entry for &quot;university,&quot; as captured by Bluesky user <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeremyfcohen.bsky.social/post/3m47dlennhs26" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Jeremy Cohen</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-27_at_15.25.20.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-27_at_15.25.20.png" style="height:695px;width:604px;" alt="Bluesky screenshot of a Grokipedia entry for &quot;university.&quot;" data-uuid="e7bc4782-1646-49be-be63-1b7c28867f8e"><figcaption>Bluesky screenshot of a Grokipedia entry for &quot;university.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluesky</div></figure><p>And here&#39;s a screenshot of Grokipedia&#39;s entry for Musk, which was captured by Bleusky user <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/milesklee.bsky.social/post/3m47dv3uh4c25" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Miles Lee</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-27_at_15.23.15.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-27_at_15.23.15.png" style="height:486px;width:590px;" alt="Grokipedia entry for Elon Musk." data-uuid="82fd1576-9ade-49b9-bbd7-af51f9376f1b"><figcaption>Grokipedia entry for Elon Musk.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluesky</div></figure><p>X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-grokipedia-is-online-after-it-briefly-crashed-out-231108836.html?src=rss
