<p>LG has revealed a new lineup of gaming monitors <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html">just ahead of CES</a>. The UltraGear evo displays offer 5K visuals. Many incorporate on-device AI upscaling, taking some of the burden away from the GPU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG says the tech will let consumers skip out on some card upgrades. This could end up being extremely beneficial because the AI boom has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html"><ins>been impacting GPU prices</ins></a>.</p>

<p>There are three displays in the lineup so far, with more to come down the line. There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &quot;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&quot;</p>
<p>This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time. It&#39;s curved with a 21:9 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a 27-inch MiniLED (27GM950B) in the lineup. This display has been &quot;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&quot;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &quot;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&quot;</p>
<p>This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display. You didn&#39;t read that wrong. This is a 52-inch gaming monitor. This 5K display offers a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.</p>
<p>LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost. With all the tech on offer, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll cost a pretty penny.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html?src=rss
