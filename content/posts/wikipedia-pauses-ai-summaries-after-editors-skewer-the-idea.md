<p>Wikipedia is backing off AI article summaries… for now. Earlier this month, the platform trialed the feature in its mobile app. To say they weren't well-received by editors would be an understatement. The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) paused the test a day later.</p>
<p>The AI summaries appeared at the top of articles for 10 percent of mobile users. Readers had to opt in to see them. The AI-generated summaries only appeared "on a set of articles" for the two-week trial period.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Editor comments in the WMF's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">announcement</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">via</a> <em>404 Media</em>) ranged from "Yuck" to "Grinning with horror." One editor wrote, "Just because Google has rolled out its AI summaries doesn't mean we need to one-up them. I sincerely beg you not to test this, on mobile or anywhere else. This would do immediate and irreversible harm to our readers and to our reputation as a decently trustworthy and serious source."</p>
<p>"Wikipedia has in some ways become a byword for sober boringness, which is excellent," the editor continued. "Let's not insult our readers' intelligence and join the stampede to roll out flashy AI summaries."</p>

<p>Editors' gripes weren't limited to the idea. They also criticized the nonprofit for excluding them from the planning phase. "You also say this has been 'discussed,' which is thoroughly laughable as the 'discussion' you link to has exactly one participant, the original poster, who is another WMF employee," an editor wrote.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>404 Media</em>, a WMF spokesperson said the backlash influenced its decision. "It is common to receive a variety of feedback from volunteers, and we incorporate it in our decisions, and sometimes change course," the spokesperson stated. "We welcome such thoughtful feedback — this is what continues to make Wikipedia a truly collaborative platform of human knowledge."</p>
<p>In the "discussion" page, the organization explained that it wanted to cater to its audience's needs. "Many readers need some simplified text in addition to the main content," a WMF employee <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_218#Simple_Article_Summaries:_research_so_far_and_next_steps">wrote</a>. "In previous research, we heard that readers wanted to have an option to get a quick overview of a topic prior to jumping into reading the full article."</p>
<p>The WMF employee stated that the average reading level for adult native English speakers is that of a 14- or 15-year-old. "It may be lower for non-native English speakers who regularly read English Wikipedia," they added.</p>
<p>The organization didn't rule out future uses of AI. But they said editors won't be left in the dark next time.  "Bringing generative AI into the Wikipedia reading experience is a serious set of decisions, with important implications, and we intend to treat it as such," the spokesperson told <em>404 Media</em>. "We do not have any plans for bringing a summary feature to the wikis without editor involvement."</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editors-skewer-the-idea-200029490.html?src=rss
