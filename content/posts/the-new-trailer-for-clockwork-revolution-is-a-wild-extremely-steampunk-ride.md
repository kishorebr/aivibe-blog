<p>Two years after it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-traveling-rpg-of-steampunk-anarchy-183507054.html">first announced</a>, we just got an extended trailer for inXile entertainment's <em>Clockwork Revolution </em>at the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/live-updates-from-the-xbox-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-200036748.html">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it looks kind of incredible â€” and completely over the top. (A man dubbed "The Knob" pisses his pants a minute and 56 seconds in, and someone else later gets cursed out by an automaton doll).</p>
<p><em>Clockwork Revolution </em>is a first-person steampunk RPG set in 1895 in a place called Avalon, which is ruled by the time-manipulating Lady Ironwood. As the customizable player-character Morgan Vanette, you'll have to use her own tactics against her to turn back time and undo the damage she's caused. As with all things time travel, the butterfly effect will be at play. The new trailer, which is over 5 minutes long, shows us this will be one with a lot of action and bloodshed (plus some <em>brain</em>-shed), and a good share of ridiculousness too.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We still don't have a release date, though, just the assurance that it's "coming in due time." When it does eventually arrive, <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox PC, Steam and Xbox Cloud. It'll also support Xbox Play Anywhere, and will be available through Xbox Game Pass.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-new-trailer-for-clockwork-revolution-is-a-wild-extremely-steampunk-ride-203854022.html?src=rss
