<p>Believe it or not, this sale actually makes the two-meter version cheaper than the one-meter version. The latter at the moment would set you back $39.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>If you have an iPhone 16, iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-magsafe-charger-will-juice-up-the-iphone-16-faster-than-the-old-accessory-can-203435004.html">this cable can charge your device at 25W</a> as long as it's connected to a 30W power adapter on the other end. While you'll need a more recent iPhone to get the fastest MagSafe charging speeds, the charger can wirelessly top up the battery of any iPhone from the last eight years (iPhone 8 and later). With older iPhones, the charging speed tops out at 15W. The cable works with AirPods wireless charging cases too — it's certified for Qi2.2 and Qi charging.</p>
