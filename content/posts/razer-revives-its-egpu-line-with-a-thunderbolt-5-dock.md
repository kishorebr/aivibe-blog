<p>Razer is back with a new addition to its Core line of external graphics enclosures. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-egpus/razer-core-x-v2"><ins>Razer Core X V2</ins></a> external graphics enclosure can house recent GPUs from brands including NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon. It uses a single Thunderbolt 5 cable to the host device; in its press materials, Razer claims this tech delivers up to twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4. This is true, but Thunderbolt 5 still isn't on the level of a modern desktop GPU connection, being roughly equivalent to 8 lanes of PCIe Gen 3. The Core X V2 s not available yet, but will retail for $350 when it does go on sale some time "soon."</p>
<p>An eGPU can beef up the visual power of a gaming laptop or handheld. Razer has had several available over the years, starting with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-22-razer-blade-stealth-core-review.html"><ins>Core</ins></a> alongside its Blade Stealth model in 2016. It followed up with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-22-razer-core-x-egpu.html"><ins>Core X</ins></a> in 2018 and the colorful <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-16-razers-new-egpu-box-features-a-700w-power-supply-and-chroma-rgb.html"><ins>Core X Chroma</ins></a> in 2019. The availability of Thunderbolt 5 ports has renewed interest in this product category since it increases the maximum bandwidth for an eGPU. ASUS also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/product-news/2025-rog-xg-mobile-leads-new-era-of-egpus-with-thunderbolt-5/"><ins>introduced</ins></a> an eGPU of its own at CES 2025.</p>
