<p>X is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/2014079005025247240" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">rolling out a new feature</a> called “Starterpacks” to all users in the coming weeks, the company’s head of product has announced. It’s made up of compilations of accounts new users can follow based on their interests. If that sounds familiar, it’s because Bluesky <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-starter-packs-help-new-users-find-their-way-234322177.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched a very similar feature</a> that’s also called “starter packs” back in 2024. Bluesky allows ordinary users to curate their own packs as long as each one doesn’t exceed 50 accounts. They can then share those lists broadly on the platform or directly with new users via QR code. X, on the other hand, compiled and curated its own lists. </p><p>In his announcement, X head of product Nikita Bier said the company “scoured the world for the top posters in every niche and country.” X then compiled them into Starterpacks “to help new users find the best accounts — big or small — for their interests.” Before X announced its own take on the feature, other social media services had already launched their clones of Bluesky’s tool. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-take-on-bluesky-starter-packs-is-live-193106158.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Threads’ version</a>, which rolled out in late 2024, puts collections of recommended profiles as suggestions in the feeds of new users. Mastodon launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodon-is-adding-bluesky-like-starter-packs-182014446.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">its own in 2025</a>, which gives existing users the freedom to choose whether they can or can’t be included in the lists. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-also-launching-bluesky-like-starter-packs-050057033.html?src=rss
