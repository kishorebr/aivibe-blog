<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Several neat-looking games arrived this week, we got release dates for several others that I&#39;m <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heist-game-relooted-gets-a-release-date-173456541.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">really looking forward to</a> and a brand-new Steam festival was announced.&nbsp;</p><p>The Love, Romance, and Heartbreak Debutante Ball is said to be the first Valentine&#39;s Day-themed Steam festival. It&#39;ll run from February 13 to 20 and feature more than 100 games, including discounts and demos. A showcase will take place on February 13 at 1PM ET on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHFkzHblsQfyuQF-mR-MPA" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Sunny Demeanor Games YouTube channel</a> too.</p><p>Organizers say the festival includes a wide variety of games about love, including RPGs, puzzle games and (naturally) visual novels. You might play as a cat or someone trying to fish an engagement ring out of a claw machine, as a secret agent or a couple that&#39;s run off to another planet. I&#39;m intrigued! There will be some NSFW games involved, for what it&#39;s worth.</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn1pi1UKJXc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check </em>seems like a 3D version of <em>Papers Please</em> but with zombies. At a checkpoint amid a zombie outbreak, your mission is to screen survivors for signs of infection. If you&#39;re unsure of their status, you can send an individual to quarantine for further observation or a lab for additional screening. Otherwise, you can let them in or send them to &quot;liquidation.&quot; Get things wrong and it could spell disaster, but at least you have a sidearm (and a weaponized drone) to help you deal with sticky situations.</p><p>It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check,</em> which is from Brigada Games and publisher Devolver Digital. There are base and resource management aspects as well. It&#39;s out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam</a> (usually $20, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until January 26) and PC Game Pass.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1c9juK-z7Fw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Air Hares</em> seems to draw inspiration from classic top-down shoot-&#39;em-ups. But instead of simply blowing up countless ships, your mission is to restore farmland. You&#39;ll fire seeds and water to turn barren land into fertile carrot fields. There are still enemies to contend with — you (and perhaps a co-op partner) can dodge and ram them as you try to protect the land.&nbsp;Expect boss battles, too.</p><p>I really like the aesthetic here. It has a &#39;90s-style cartoon look (I suddenly really want a modern Bucky O&#39;Hare game). Also, the song from the trailer is going to live in my head for weeks.</p><p>Husband-and-wife team Tim and Megan Bungeroth created <em>Air Hares </em>over six years with the help of several contributors. According to a press release, the game is &quot;inspired by the creators’ personal journey with infertility and the idea of creating life rather than destroying it.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Air Hares</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Steam</a>. It typically costs $9, but there&#39;s a 20 percent discount until January 28.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpEAiQ5BCqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Luckshot Games&#39; <em>Big Hops</em> looks like my kind of 3D platformer: joyous and playful. As a young frog who has been kidnapped, you&#39;ll try to find airship parts for a raccoon who has promised to help get you home.</p><p>There are tons of movement mechanics here, and Hop&#39;s tongue plays a major role in those. You can use it to swing across gaps, hookshot your way to higher platforms and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/big-hops-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016219" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">PS5</a> for $20. The Switch and Steam versions have a 10 percent launch discount until January 19.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXk4QbJthX8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Cassette Boy </em>is a pixel-art game that might appear to be a 2D exploration puzzler, but there&#39;s more going on here. You can rotate the world to discover new secrets and hide enemies and hazards from view so you can move past them. If you can&#39;t see something on your screen, it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s a bit of a <em>Fez </em>influence here, it would appear.</p><p>Wonderland Kazakiri and publisher Pocketpair are behind this one, which I&#39;m looking forward to checking out when I have a chance. <em>Cassette Boy </em>is available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cassette-boy-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Switch</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016744" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">PS4, PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=65a90182-7193-42ba-8fdd-e43829c445b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+One+and+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jYXNzZXR0ZS1ib3kvOU5DTlJIS0cySDQ0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NWE5MDE4Mi03MTkzLTQyYmEtOGZkZC1lNDM4MjljNDQ1YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2Nhc3NldHRlLWJveS85TkNOUkhLRzJINDQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcgUS1P_S6SZc3gQOZUAPu-jnXaxMK7syPIPSyWIV-6w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcassette-boy%2F9NCNRHKG2H44" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cassette-boy/9NCNRHKG2H44">Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S</a> for $13.</p><h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-spooky-nes-platformer-more-n-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000259.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">I really enjoyed the demo</a> for <em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em> (as well as Aerial_Knight’s previous games). I&#39;m for sure going to be playing the full game when it hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3465190/Aerial_Knights_DropShot/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Steam</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/aerial_knights-dropshot-b8cc03" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">Epic Games Store</a> on February 17.</p><p>This is a single-player first-person shooter in which you&#39;re skydiving with finger guns. You compete with four enemies to grab the only available parachute as you&#39;re falling through the air. Rounds are fast-paced too, generally lasting under a minute.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nr0mqovgrHA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Point-and-click adventure <em>Earth Must Die</em> has been on my radar for a while and we&#39;ll all get a chance to try it soon. It&#39;s designed to be a playable cartoon (with a runtime of about eight hours) and it has an art style to match.&nbsp;</p><p>The cast is pretty stellar, with Ben Starr (<em>Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II</em>), Joel Fry (<em>Our Flag Means Death</em>) and a whole load of British comedy figures on board. There&#39;s a demo available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Steam</a> now and the full game — from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots — will land on January 27.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3EZWYCHknCU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s wrap things up for this week something very silly-looking from Monster Shop Games. <em>Pie in the Sky </em>is a Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater-inspired action arcade game in which you play as a magpie that terrorizes bystanders. You can knock people off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, ram kids off of scooters, actually go skateboarding and, uh, cause havoc from above. In classic <em>THPS</em>-style, there are hidden areas too.&nbsp;</p><p>This looks like a fun distraction from [gestures at everything]. <em>Pie is the Sky</em> will swoop onto <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941360/Pie_in_the_Sky/" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">Steam</a> on February 2.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/papers-please-but-with-zombies-a-farming-based-shoot-em-up-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-123000437.html?src=rss
