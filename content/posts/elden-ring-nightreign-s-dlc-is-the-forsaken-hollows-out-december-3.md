This DLC is the first big content update for the spinoff, although Nightreign did receive previous updates to add improved tuning for the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-is-adding-two-player-co-op-next-week-182708700.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">two-player</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-patch-will-make-gameplay-easier-for-solo-players-183644323.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">solo-player</a> experiences, as well introducing an even-more-punishing Deep of Night mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer shows exactly the grim, macabre setting and inventive-looking boss designs that we&#39;ve come to expect from FromSoft. <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> will add two more character classes for players to choose from. The book-wielding Scholar is an arcane magic user who &quot;gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.&quot; This seems like a good choice for the tactically-minded players, while the new Undertaker class favors faith and strength builds.&nbsp;There will also be a new region to explore and two new bosses. </p><p>We learned yesterday that DLC was in the works for Nightreign thanks to a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">mention</a> during the earnings report from parent company Kadokawa, but it seemed the new content might not be ready until early 2026. Hopefully today&#39;s announcement will calm the players who have been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">review-bombing</a> the game on Steam due to the lack of information about updates. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-dlc-is-the-forsaken-hollows-out-december-3-233113937.html?src=rss
