<p>The egg-cooking roguelike <em>Omelet You Cook</em> is officially available for PC via Steam. It was shadow-dropped during the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-watch-the-wholesome-direct-showcase-on-june-7-at-12pm-et-181249575.html"><ins>Wholesome Direct livestream</ins></a>, which falls in the middle of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-what-new-game-announcements-to-expect-how-to-watch-and-schedule-151743902.html"><ins>Summer Game Fest</ins></a>. This quirky title was first revealed last year, but now we can get our grubby little paws on it.</p>
<p>The game looks like a good combination of chaos and strategy, casting players as a line cook at a middle school cafeteria. There&#39;s a bit of <em>Overcooked</em> here, along with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.comfycozygaming.com/2024/01/10/venba-review/"><ins>narrative-focused cooking sim </ins><em><ins>Venba</ins></em></a> and the sushi minigame part of <em>Dave the Diver</em>. It looks really fun.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just a chaotic minigame. Players can add and prep ingredients between rounds, and there are rare relics that provide power-ups. There&#39;s even a hungry dog that hoovers up unwanted ingredients.</p>
<p>This is an early access release, so folks should expect updates and changes as the months roll on. Developer SchuBox Games is also working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2174850/Dicey_Birdball/?curator_clanid=45187966"><ins>football sim that stars chickens</ins></a> called <em>Dicey Birdball</em>, but that one didn&#39;t get a surprise drop today. That team sure does love poultry.&nbsp;</p>
