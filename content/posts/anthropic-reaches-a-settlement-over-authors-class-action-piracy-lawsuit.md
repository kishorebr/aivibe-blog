<p>Anthropic has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.434709/gov.uscourts.cand.434709.354.0.pdf">settled</a> a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of authors for an undisclosed sum. The move means the company will avoid a potentially more costly ruling if the case regarding its use of copyright materials to train artificial intelligence tools had moved forward.</p>
<p>&quot;This historic settlement will benefit all class members,&quot; said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. &quot;We look forward to announcing details of the settlement in the coming weeks.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In June, Judge William Alsup handed down <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/judge-rules-anthropics-ai-training-on-copyrighted-materials-is-fair-use-182602056.html">a mixed result</a> in the case, ruling that Anthropic&#39;s move to train LLMs on copyrighted materials constituted fair use. However the company&#39;s illegal and unpaid acquisition of those copyrighted materials was deemed available for the authors to pursue as a piracy case. With statutory damages for piracy beginning at $750 per infringed work and a library of pirated works estimated to number about 7 million, Anthropic could have been on the hook for billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Litigation around AI and copyright is still shaking out, with no clear precedents emerging yet. This also isn&#39;t Anthropic&#39;s first foray into negotiating with creatives after using their work; it was sued by members of the music industry in 2023 and reached <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-agrees-to-work-with-music-publishers-to-prevent-copyright-infringement-154742806.html">a partial resolution</a> earlier this year. Plus, the details of Anthropic&#39;s settlement also have yet to be revealed. Depending on the number of authors who make a claim and the amount Anthropic agreed to pay out, either side could wind up feeling like the winner after the dust settles.</p>
