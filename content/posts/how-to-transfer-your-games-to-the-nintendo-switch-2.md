<p>Upgrading to the Switch 2 is a big step forward, thanks to the larger screen, new features and improved performance. But shifting to a new console naturally raises the question of what happens to all your games and save data on the one you already have. Thankfully, Nintendo has built a clear <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">System Transfer</a> process that lets you move your account, digital purchases, save files and other key data from your original Switch to the Switch 2. If you prepare ahead of time, you can be back to playing your favorite titles on new hardware in minutes.</p><p>We’ll walk you through everything you need to know, including what transfers, how to start the process and what to check once you’re set up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="3dfe3624-a994-4b63-99b4-fad2f96c1ada">Before you transfer: A quick checklist</h2><p>Running through these steps first will save you time later:</p><ul><li><p>Charge your original Switch and your Switch 2, and keep them near each other.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a stable Wi-Fi connection, as this is required to verify your Nintendo Account and manage redownloads.</p></li><li><p>Update your original Switch by installing the latest system software so the transfer can run without interruptions.</p></li><li><p>Confirm your Nintendo Account is linked, and each user you want to move is tied to a Nintendo Account.</p></li><li><p>Most Switch titles work on Switch 2, but a few may have issues, so it’s worth checking <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Nintendo’s compatibility list</a> ahead of time.</p></li><li><p>Back up screenshots and videos if needed. These should transfer, but it never hurts to have your own copy.</p></li></ul><h2 id="891d7969-dd53-4f00-aadf-b7f103a15903">How to start the transfer of data from your old Switch to the Switch 2</h2><p>With your original Nintendo Switch to hand, navigate to <strong>System Settings</strong>, select <strong>Users</strong> then select <strong>Transfer Your User &amp; Save Data</strong>. Pick the user profile you want to move, confirm your Nintendo Account information and follow the on-screen prompts.</p><p>Power on your Switch 2 and go through the initial setup. When the console asks if you want to transfer data from another system, select <strong>Start System Transfer</strong>. Make sure both consoles are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and remain powered on during the process.</p><p>Once the Switch 2 detects your original console, it will guide you through pairing the systems for the transfer. After the connection is established the original Switch will begin sending your user information, save data and settings.</p><p>When the transfer is complete, your new console will automatically log in using your Nintendo Account. Your digital games will appear in the <strong>Redownload</strong> section of the eShop so you can pull them onto your Switch 2 as needed.</p><h2 id="29c233fd-4d3e-499d-a230-9610a6f53319">What to do after your transfer is complete</h2><p>Once everything has moved to the Switch 2, there are a few final steps that help round out the process. You can redownload your digital games from the eShop and start reinstalling your favorites. Any controllers, Joy-Con or Bluetooth accessories you used with your original console will need to be paired again (provided they are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Switch 2-compatible accessories</a>), which only takes a minute. It’s also a good time to update your games to their latest versions and restore any parental controls or family group settings you had before.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re confident that all your data has transferred and everything is working as expected, you can then decide whether to keep your old console, hand it down or perform a factory reset if you plan to sell it.</p><h2 id="befe0488-a5e3-439e-aa5d-82588c531b8c">What data transfers to the Switch 2</h2><p>Nintendo’s System Transfer moves everything tied to your Nintendo Account, including digital games you’ve purchased, save data, user profiles, parental controls, system settings and screenshots and video captures.&nbsp;</p><p>Your Nintendo Switch Online membership moves as well, and you’ll be able to immediately re-download your digital games on the Switch 2 once the transfer completes. Physical Switch game cards also work on the new console, though some titles may require patches or updates for the best performance. Nintendo has noted that a small number of older games may have temporary compatibility issues, but these are being reviewed.</p><h2 id="7e9a71ec-e7f4-47b9-a453-c1debd2cdada">What data doesn’t transfer automatically</h2><p>A few settings won’t carry over on their own, so you may need to handle them manually once your Switch 2 is set up. Bluetooth pairing for controllers or headphones will need to be reconnected, since those device links stay tied to the original console. Your Wi-Fi passwords also won’t transfer, so you’ll have to sign in to your home network again.&nbsp;</p><p>Some game-specific preferences, as well as language or region settings, may require another quick adjustment on the Switch 2, but these are simple to reconfigure and only take a few moments.</p><h2 id="cf32dad8-d241-4151-95c7-5ab4e46a8d2f">Troubleshooting and other things to consider</h2><p>If you run into issues while getting settled, a few common scenarios are worth keeping in mind. Some older titles may have temporary compatibility problems on the new console, so if a game behaves unexpectedly, check <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Nintendo’s updated compatibility list</a> for known issues.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also notice slower download speeds as the Switch 2 queues up your full library after the transfer. It helps to prioritize the games you want to play first so they can download ahead of the rest. Storage can also play a role. If you use a microSD card, wait until the system transfer is complete before inserting it into the new console, since the Switch 2 may need to reformat the card.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, don’t reset your old Switch right away. Keeping it powered on and accessible ensures you can confirm that all your saves and data made it across safely.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-transfer-your-games-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000702.html?src=rss
