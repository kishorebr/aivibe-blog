<p>We now have some idea of what&#39;s at stake in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html">longstanding feud</a> between Elon Musk and OpenAI. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the latest filing, as part of a lawsuit that accuses the AI giant of abandoning its non-profit status, claims that Musk is owed anywhere between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages from the &quot;wrongful gains&quot; of OpenAI and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Musk claimed in the filing that he&#39;s entitled to a portion of OpenAI&#39;s recent valuation at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-private-company-at-500-billion-133028221.html">$500 billion</a>, after contributing $38 million in &quot;seed funding&quot; during the AI company&#39;s startup years. Along with providing &quot;roughly 60 percent of the nonprofit&#39;s seed funding,&quot; Musk offered recruiting of key employees, introductions with business contacts and startup advice, according to the filing. The monetary estimate comes from C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist who&#39;s serving as Musk&#39;s expert in the case. According to Wazzan&#39;s calculations, OpenAI earned between $65.5 billion and $109.43 billion in wrongful gains, while Microsoft saw between $13.3 billion and $25.06 billion.</p>
