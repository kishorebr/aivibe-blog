<p>Ubisoft continues to raise eyebrows around how it is treating employees as it attempts a business overhaul. David Michaud-Cromp, a level design team lead at Ubisoft Montreal, said last week that he was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-punishes-developer-union-strike-return-to-office-2000663771" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">suspended</a> for three days without pay after voicing opposition to the company&#39;s return to office mandate. Today, Michaud-Cromp <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=11e7f272-fc8b-4167-bc55-096c33c2e509&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;linkText=posted&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAASWkyz-XO-ajVFlb-8GlqOcifn5Jqvg0AASrov_I_3Wi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdavid-michaud-cromp-10668035_today-i-was-terminated-by-ubisoft-effective-activity-7424133083051978757-F2ho%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LinkedIn;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_today-i-was-terminated-by-ubisoft-effective-activity-7424133083051978757-F2ho/">posted</a> on LinkedIn that he has been fired. &quot;I was terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This was not my decision.&quot;</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft gave <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Kotaku</em></a> the following statement regarding Michaud-Cromp&#39;s dismissal: &quot;Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal. We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity, and repetition of the breach.&quot; We&#39;ve reached out to the company for additional confirmation and comment.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the latest in a sequence of bad press Ubisoft has faced regarding its workforce. Shortly after many employees at Ubisoft Halifax unionized, the parent company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">shut down</a> the studio. In announcing the closure, Ubisoft said the move was part of a broader cost-cutting endeavor across its operations; it shut down a support studio and cut more jobs <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">later in January</a>, with even more layoffs <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">proposed</a>. Most recently, unions representing other Ubisoft workers called for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">a three-day strike</a> in response to the &quot;penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions&quot; they alleged of the company&#39;s management.</p><p>All these issues could all be coincidental timing. But if so, they&#39;re coincidences that don&#39;t reflect favorably on Ubisoft.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html?src=rss
