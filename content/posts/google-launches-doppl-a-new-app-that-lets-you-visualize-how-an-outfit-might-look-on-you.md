Google is launching a new experimental app called Doppl that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you, the company announced on Thursday. The app is available on iOS and Android in the U.S.

Doppl is designed to let you virtually try on outfits on a digital version of yourself. The app works by first getting you to upload a full-body photo of yourself. From there, you can use photos or screenshots of different outfits to virtually try them on. These images could be a photo of an outfit you see at a thrift store or on a friend, or even a screenshot of an outfit you see while scrolling through social media. 


	
	




	
	



Once you select an outfit that you want to visualize, Doppl will create an image of a virtual version of yourself wearing the outfit. Doppl can also take these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos so you can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. 

You can save your favorite looks and browse through all of your other virtual try-ons. Plus, you can also share your look with others.

The tech giant says the new app builds on Google Shopping’s recently launched capabilities that allow you to try on clothes virtually. By launching the functionality in a stand-alone app, Google is making the feature easier to access while allowing people to explore their style in a fun and interactive way, the company believes. It may also help Google collect more data on how apps like this could work, to aid its future efforts in the space.

While Google has offered virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. With Doppl, the company is letting you try clothes on an animated version of your own body.

“We hope Doppl helps you explore your style in new and exciting ways,” Google said in a blog post. “As a Google Labs experiment, Doppl is in its early days and it might not always get things right. Fit, appear
