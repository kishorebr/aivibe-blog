AI needs a better brain — and Edo Liberty is building it.

At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Pinecone founder and CEO Edo Liberty will explain why the next wave of AI-native apps won’t be driven by bigger models, but by smarter search. With 10,000+ startup and VC leaders expected to be at Disrupt, this AI Stage fireside chat and presentation is a must-attend session.



The future of AI isn’t more data — it’s better retrieval

As AI becomes more embedded in every workflow, the real differentiator isn’t just the algorithm — it’s how you access and use the right data at the right time. Liberty believes that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and purpose-built infrastructure are the next frontier, and search is at the center of it all.


	
	




	
	



In his session, “Why the Next Frontier Is Search,” Liberty will unpack how vector databases and high-performance infrastructure are unlocking the full potential of AI. With so much data in play, knowing how to find what matters — fast — is everything. This talk goes deep into the stack that’s powering smarter, more scalable applications across industries.

Why you don’t want to miss this session

Liberty helped build the backbone of AI at Amazon, and now with Pinecone, he’s scaling next-gen search for hundreds of thousands of developers and enterprise teams. If you’re building with AI, this is your roadmap to where the ecosystem is heading next.
