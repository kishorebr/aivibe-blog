<p>As has been the case for many years now, Fire TV devices are among the almost-guaranteed sales to be included in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a>. On of the best deals in this category right now is the Fire TV Stick HD, which is down to an all-time-low price of $18.</p> 
<p>We recently added this dongle to our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">best streaming devices</a> guide as our top budget pick. It simply gets the job done without too much fuss or extra money spent. It's easy to set up, gives you access to all of the major streaming platforms and streams content in 1080p.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>It also comes with an updated remote control, which is the same remote that comes with Fire TVs. It allows for voice control, so you can simply ask it to look for something to watch and let Alexa do the rest. It can also control the power and volume on the TV, which is something previous Fire Stick remotes couldn't do.</p> 
<p>The one caveat is right there in the name. This is a stick that supports HD content and cannot stream in 4K. That could be a dealbreaker for some, though the price is most certainly right. If you absolutely must have that 4K magic on your set, consider the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0BP9SNVH9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2d5ae540-1f13-4a27-aab5-f19b9e89a45f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Fire+TV+Stick+4K+Max&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQlA5U05WSDk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmQ1YWU1NDAtMWYxMy00YTI3LWFhYjUtZjE5YjllODlhNDVmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQlA5U05WSDkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQbeEif1DvpEtxRfJdGTXxNa0KoCFwd1webhQrmH8Jky&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BP9SNVH9" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?ref_=MARS_NAVSTRIPE_desktop_firetv_smp_stick4kmax">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle.
