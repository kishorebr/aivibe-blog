<p>If you can't get your hands on the latest <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-finally-buy-the-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-but-dont-expect-a-prime-day-deal-195558235.html">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, you might be able to keep the FOMO at bay in the meantime with a clever mod for your Switch Lite. Retro Remake's co-founder, Taki Udon, posted a video showing off a working version of the SUPER5 OLED Touch HDMI mod. As the lengthy name suggests, this third-party mod adds an OLED display, a glass touchscreen and HDMI output to the Switch Lite.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is barely a month old so it's too early to expect any news on a Switch Lite successor. However, the Retro Remake's mod adds some crucial upgrades to Nintendo's handheld that was released in 2019 and gives us some idea of what a next-gen version could look like. Notably, it's a no-solder mod that mostly only requires connecting cables and can output 1080p HDMI video to a larger screen than the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch LCD touchscreen.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Retro Remake previously offered a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit-batch-3-preorder-1">SUPER5 OLED Touch mod</a>, which lacked the HDMI feature. Adding the extra feature proved to be a serious challenge, according to the company's co-founder, who said the project took "18 months of R&amp;D, just as many failed revisions, and more than $200K in costs."</p>
<p>"I can't describe how soul-crushing it was to go through so many failed revisions," Taki Udon <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942600677542486340">wrote on X</a>. "After the third failure, I was hopeful every subsequent version would be successful, but they weren't."</p>
<p>Testing is still underway for the SUPER5 OLED Touch HDMI upgrade kit, but the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1943535021035544885">latest post</a> shows that the Switch Lite mod playing <em>Mario Kart</em> on a larger display. Retro Remake's HDMI upgrade kits start at $90, but are currently sold out on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit">its website</a>. According to an email sent out to preorder customers, the company is unsure of when it will ship these kits out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/this-hdmi-mod-lets-you-play-nintendo-switch-lite-on-a-big-screen-164625907.html?src=rss
