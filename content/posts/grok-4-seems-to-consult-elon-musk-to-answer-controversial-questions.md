During xAI’s launch of Grok 4 on Wednesday night, Elon Musk said — while livestreaming the event on his social media platform, X — that his AI company’s ultimate goal was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” But where exactly does Grok 4 seek out the truth when trying to answer controversial questions?

The newest AI model from xAI seems to consult social media posts from Musk’s X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, and immigration laws, according to several users who posted about the phenomenon on social media. Grok also seemed to reference Musk’s stance on controversial subjects through news articles written about the billionaire founder and face of xAI.


	
	




	
	



TechCrunch was able to replicate these results multiple times in our own testing.


I replicated this result, that Grok focuses nearly entirely on finding out what Elon thinks in order to align with that, on a fresh Grok 4 chat with no custom instructions.https://t.co/NgeMpGWBOB https://t.co/MEcrtY3ltR pic.twitter.com/QTWzjtYuxR— Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward) July 10, 2025


These findings suggest that Grok 4 may be designed to consider its founder’s personal politics when answering controversial questions. Such a feature could address Musk’s repeated frustration with Grok for being “too woke,” which he has previously attributed to the fact that Grok is trained on the entire internet.

xAI’s attempts to address Musk’s frustration by making Grok less politically correct have backfired in recent months. Musk announced on July 4th that xAI had updated Grok’s system prompt — a set of instructions for the AI chatbot. Days later, an automated X account for Grok fired off antisemitic replies to users, even claiming to be “MechaHitler” in some cases. Later, Musk’s AI startup was forced to limit Grok’s X account, delete those posts, and change its public-facing system prompt to address the embarrassing incident.
