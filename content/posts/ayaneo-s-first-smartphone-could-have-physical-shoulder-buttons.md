<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-premium-handheld-from-ayaneos-budget-brand-arrives-in-september-183533792.html">Ayaneo</a> is breaking into the competitive smartphone market with its latest offering, but it&#39;s hoping to attract the mobile gamers out there. In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dol0mdKunVE">teaser posted</a> to its YouTube, the gaming handheld maker offered its first look at the Ayaneo Phone. As vague as the trailer is, Ayaneo clearly has a target demographic in mind, describing the smartphone as when a &quot;mobile phone meets the soul of gaming handheld.&quot;</p>
<div id="afcbc24040e84828867a398f4b7cadd6"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dol0mdKunVE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>From the teaser, it looks like the Ayaneo Phone will be built with a standard dual-camera setup. Perhaps more relevant for its gaming-centric design, it looks like the smartphone will have physical shoulder buttons when held horizontally. Ayaneo previously mentioned the Ayaneo Phone during a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfOJU3jf9_g&amp;t=4667s">product sharing session</a> in the summer, where it hinted at a form factor that slides out. This could be another hint that Ayaneo is looking at making a modern-day version of the Sony Xperia Play, particularly since the Ayaneo Phone will fall under the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/796">Remake branding</a> that features remakes of retro consoles and devices.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Considering Ayaneo&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html">price tags</a> for its other products, the Ayaneo Phone likely won&#39;t be cheap. However, it could offer serious competition to other gaming smartphones from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-rog-phone-8-from-asus-finally-puts-a-good-camera-in-a-gaming-phone-002618805.html">Asus</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://redmagic.tech/pages/redmagic-10-pro">Redmagic</a>.</p>
