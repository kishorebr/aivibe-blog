<p>The peak time for deals on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That&#39;s $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>
