<p>The new <em>Street Fighter</em> movie has been given a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/"><ins>release date</ins></a> of October 16, 2026. Kitao Sakurai is directing the project and a few generic plot details have been disclosed. The story will be set in 1993, a nod to the year <em>Street Fighter II </em>was released in arcades, and will have familiar characters from the game uncovering &quot;a deadly conspiracy&quot; in the midst of all their street fighting.</p>
<p>It seems safe to expect a fair bit of camp in a <em>Street Fighter</em> project, and that bears out in some of the casting. Andrew Koji will play Ryu; he&#39;s had several past action roles such as <em>Bullet Train</em> and TV series <em>Warrior</em>, so that feels like a solid choice. Noah Centineo is taking a break from his work in Netflix rom-coms (notably <em>To All the Boys I&#39;ve Loved Before</em> and its sequels) to play Ken. Newcomer Callina Liang, who only has a few credits to date, will play Chun-li. David Dastmalchian will be filling the great Raul Julia&#39;s shoes (and oversized hat) as M. Bison.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Then things really get wacky. Curtis Jackson (who you know as rapper 50 Cent) is playing Balrog and country artist Orville Peck is Vega. Jason Momoa has been cast as Blanka, while WWE wrestler Cody Rhodes has even been chosen to play Guile. This could be absolute gold or absolute trash or possibly both at the same time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-new-street-fighter-movie-lands-in-theaters-next-october-222724911.html?src=rss
