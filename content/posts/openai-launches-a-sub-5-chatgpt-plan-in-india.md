OpenAI today launched a new, cheaper ChatGPT paid subscription plan in India called ChatGPT GO, priced at ‚Çπ399 per month ($4.60), which is more affordable than the ‚Çπ1,999 (about $23) per month Plus Plan.

The company had turned on local currency pricing for all its plans a few days ago, and with this launch, it will also allow users to pay through UPI (Unified Payment Interface), India‚Äôs payment framework.


	
	




	
	



Nick Turley, VP at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT, said that this plan will increase the message, image generation, and file uploads by 10 times over the free tier. The ChatGPT Go plan will also enable better memory retention for more personalized responses, Turely said.


We just launched ChatGPT Go in India, a new subscription tier that gives users in India more access to our most popular features: 10x higher message limits, 10x more image generations, 10x more file uploads, and 2x longer memory compared with our free tier. All for Rs. 399. üáÆüá≥‚Äî Nick Turley (@nickaturley) August 19, 2025


‚ÄúMaking ChatGPT more affordable has been a key ask from users! We‚Äôre rolling out Go in India first and will learn from feedback before expanding to other countries,‚Äù Turley said.

From a currency conversion standpoint, the Plus plan was higher than $20 for Indian users when offered in local currency. The new Go plan offers a more affordable alternative to people who are looking to use ChatGPT primarily for chat, image generation, and file processing.

Tibor¬†Blaho, a software engineer with a reputation for accurately leaking upcoming AI products, had previously teased this plan and its details. 

While the company is geo-restricting this plan to India, the company said on its support page that it is working to expand this plan to more regions.
