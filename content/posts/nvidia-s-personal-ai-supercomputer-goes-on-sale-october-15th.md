<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-dgx-spark-arrives-for-worlds-ai-developers">will start selling</a> its DGX Spark “personal AI supercomputer&#8221; this week. The machine is powerful enough to let users work on sophisticated AI models but small enough to fit on a desktop.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia said Spark can be ordered online at <a href="http://nvidia.com">nvidia.com</a> starting Wednesday, October 15th, as well as from select partners and stores in the US. It said units would cost $3,000 when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631957/nvidia-dgx-spark-station-grace-blackwell-ai-supercomputers-gtc">revealed Spark</a> earlier this year, but it appears the DGX Spark will now cost $3,999, according to an infographic embedded <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-dgx-spark-arrives-for-worlds-ai-developers">in Nvidia’s press release</a>. Most PC makers have their own customized version, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769695/acer-veriton-gn-100-ai-nvidia-digits-dgx-spark">the Acer Veriton GN100, as one example,</a> also costing $3,999.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spark boasts the kind of performance that once required access to pricey, energy-hungry data centers. It could help democratize AI and would be particularly useful for researchers. When first announcing Spark earlier this year (then called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai">Digits</a>), Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said “placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buyers can expect to see a variety of similar models on the market as Nvidia has said third-party manufacturers are welcome to make their own versions. Acer, Asus, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, and MSI are all debuting their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632685/asus-ascent-gx10-dell-pro-max-gb10-hp-zgx-nano-nvidia-ai">customized versions of Spark</a>, Nvidia confirmed today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spark comes with Nvidia’s GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, 128GB of unified memory, and up to 4TB of NVMe SSD storage. Nvidia says it can deliver a petaflop of AI performance — meaning it can do a million billion calculations each second — and is capable of handling AI models with up to 200 billion parameters. It’s also small, comfortably fitting on a desk and running from a standard power outlet. Nvidia calls it “the world’s smallest AI supercomputer.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We agree: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339195/nvidia-digits-ai-supercomputer-in-person-photos-small">it really is quite tiny</a>. Spark also has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631957/nvidia-dgx-spark-station-grace-blackwell-ai-supercomputers-gtc">bigger brother, Station</a>, though there’s no word on when or if that might hit the general market.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, October 13th: </strong>An earlier version of this story misstated that the DGX Spark was “now available to buy.” It will actually go on sale October 15th.</em></p>
