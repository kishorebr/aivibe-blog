<p>Threads is working on new features that could make the text-based social network a bit more audio-friendly. Starting today, Threads is rolling out some new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@threads/post/DQ7OtMeEftX" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">features</a> for sharing podcasts and podcast episodes.

It should be interesting to see if the audiovisual addition makes it any more appealing for people to visit podcast pages. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-adding-features-for-creators-to-promote-their-podcasts-215711793.html?src=rss
