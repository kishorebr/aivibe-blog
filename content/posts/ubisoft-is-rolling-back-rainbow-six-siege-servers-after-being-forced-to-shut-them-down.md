As of Sunday afternoon, the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">status page</a> on <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>&#39;s website still shows &quot;unplanned outage&quot; on all servers across PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

<p>The fiasco began Saturday morning when Ubisoft <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808?s=20">said on X</a> that they were &quot;aware of an incident currently affecting <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>&quot; and &quot;working on a resolution.&quot; A couple of hours later, the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> servers were shut down, following plenty of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?s=20">user reports</a> showing either zero or billions in R6 credits, rare skins in their lockers and either account bans or unbans. Ubisoft later clarified Saturday afternoon <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?s=20">on X</a> that nobody would be banned if they spent their ill-gotten credits, but that a rollback of all transactions starting from Saturday, 6AM ET would soon be underway.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Sunday afternoon, Ubisoft informed the playerbase that they&#39;re currently performing a rollback, but that &quot;extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.&quot; The company added that &quot;this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed&quot; and didn&#39;t provide an estimate for when servers would be back online.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-rolling-back-rainbow-six-siege-servers-after-being-forced-to-shut-them-down-191049440.html?src=rss
