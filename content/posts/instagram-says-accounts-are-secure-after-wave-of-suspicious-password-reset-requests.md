<p>If you received a bunch of password reset requests from Instagram recently, you&#39;re not alone. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malwarebytes.com/post/3mbywfybiil26">Malwarebytes</a>, an antivirus software company, initially reported that there was a data breach revealing the &quot;sensitive information&quot; of 17.5 million Instagram users. Malwarebytes added that the leak included Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and more. However, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?s=20">Instagram said</a> there was no breach and that user accounts were &quot;secure.&quot;</p>
<div id="8216e5e1a1644775bfbb6b8aba9e1f76"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people. There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. <br><br>You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion.</p>— Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>In Malwarebytes post, the company added that the &quot;data is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals.&quot; Malwarebytes noted in an email to its customers that it discovered the breach during its routine dark web scan and that it&#39;s tied to a potential incident related to an Instagram API exposure from 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reported breach has resulted in users receiving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q93j15/instagram_data_leak_exposes_sensitive_info_of/">several</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q8pcq1/is_someone_trying_to_hack_me/">emails</a> from Instagram about password reset requests. According to Malwarebytes, the leaked information could lead to more serious attacks, like phishing attempts or account takeovers. In response, Instagram posted on X that users can ignore the recent emails requesting password resets.</p>
<p>&quot;We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,&quot; Instagram&#39;s post on X read. &quot;There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.&quot;</p>
<p>While Instagram said this isn&#39;t a data breach, its parent company has been in hot water for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-gdpr-data-breach-eu-fine-173528015.html">data breaches</a> in the past. If you haven&#39;t already, it&#39;s always a good idea to turn on two-factor authentication and change your password. Even better, you can review what devices are logged into your Instagram account in Meta&#39;s Accounts Center.</p>
