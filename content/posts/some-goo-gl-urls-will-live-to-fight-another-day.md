<p>Google&#39;s shortened URLs are the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-13-friday-the-13th-video-game-jason.html">horror movie monster</a> of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">Google Graveyard</a>: They keep finding a way to stay alive. On Friday, the company said goo.gl links that don&#39;t show the above warning will work for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Google <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-turning-off-its-googl-shortener-links-next-year-130030435.html">cut off the ability to create new shortened links</a>. But it kept existing URLs active as a courtesy to those who relied on them. Then, a year ago, the company said its bit.ly rival would <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-turning-off-its-googl-shortener-links-next-year-130030435.html">shut down completely</a> on August 25, 2025. That appeared to be the final nail in the coffin. Not so fast.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That brings us to Google&#39;s change of heart today. &quot;We understand these links are embedded in countless documents, videos, posts and more, and we appreciate the input received,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/googl-link-shortening-update/">explained</a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll know yours is shutting down if it currently shows a warning message. (&quot;This link will no longer work in the near future.&quot;) If it redirects to the destination without that detour, it will live to fight another day. Google says the survivors were chosen based on whether they showed activity in late 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/some-googl-urls-will-live-to-fight-another-day-183508123.html?src=rss
