<p class="has-text-align-none">During its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/748017/gpt-5-chatgpt-openai-release">big GPT-5 livestream on Thursday</a>, OpenAI showed off a few charts that made the model seem quite impressive — but if you look closely, some graphs were a little bit off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one, ironically showing how well GPT-5 does in “deception evals across models,” the scale is all over the place. For “coding deception,” for example, the chart shown onstage says GPT-5 with thinking apparently gets a 50.0 percent deception rate, but that’s compared to OpenAI’s smaller 47.4 percent o3 score which somehow has a larger bar. OpenAI appears to have accurate numbers for this chart in its <a href="http://I added that he says it’s correct in the blog post…">GPT-5 blog post</a>, however, where GPT-5’s deception rate is labeled as 16.5 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://x.com/EgeErdil2/status/1953505551570415718">this chart</a>, OpenAI showed onstage that one of GPT-5’s scores is <em>lower</em> than o3’s but is shown with a bigger bar. In this same chart, o3 and GPT-4o’s scores are different but shown with equally-sized bars. It was bad enough that CEO Sam Altman commented on it, <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953513280594751495">calling it</a> a “mega chart screwup,” though he noted that a correct version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/748017/gpt-5-chatgpt-openai-release">is in OpenAI’s blog post</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> An OpenAI marketing staffer also <a href="https://x.com/pranaveight/status/1953517360071299113">apologized</a>, saying, “We fixed the chart in the blog guys, apologies for the unintentional chart crime.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. And while it’s unclear if OpenAI used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/748017/gpt-5-chatgpt-openai-release">GPT-5</a> to actually make the charts, it’s still not a great look for the company on its big launch day — especially when it is touting the “significant advances in reducing hallucinations” with its new model.</p>
