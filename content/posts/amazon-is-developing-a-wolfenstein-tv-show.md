<p>Following <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-fallout-tv-series-is-a-very-awesome-tv-show-130039789.html">the success of <em>Fallout</em></a>, Amazon is turning its attention to another video game adaptation. The company is reportedly developing a series based on the Wolfenstein franchise with the help of some of the creative team behind <em>Fallout</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">according to <em>Variety</em></a>.</p>
<p>The details of how the Wolfenstein show will adapt the alternate history action of the games are still under wraps, but the subject matter remains unfortunately timely. The show&#39;s logline is &quot;The story of killing Nazis is evergreen,&quot; according to <em>Variety</em>, which seems like a direct acknowledgement of that fact.</p>

The production company also made the adaptation of the William Gibson&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-amazon-william-gibson-the-peripheral-series.html"><em>The Peripheral</em></a> for Amazon, and currently produces <em>Fallout.</em></p>
<p>While it might make sense to pair a new show with a brand new Wolfenstein game, the series has effectively been on hold since 2019. MachineGames, the Microsoft-owned developer of the last five Wolfenstein games, hasn&#39;t produced a new entry since 2019&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-wolfenstein-youngblood-e3-demo-video.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-10-wolfenstein-cyberpilot-vr-bethesda-2019.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</em></a>.
