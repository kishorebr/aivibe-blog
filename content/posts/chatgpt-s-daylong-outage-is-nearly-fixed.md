<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI’s ChatGPT service was down all day for many users after the platform started experiencing performance issues on Tuesday morning. The chatbot responded with a “Hmm…something seems to have gone wrong” error message to my colleague after failing to load, and users across <a href="https://x.com/0xweb3diva/status/1932364866221690971">X</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/new/">Reddit</a> are reporting platform outages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Downdetector showed that <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/openai/?nogeo=true&amp;_gl=1*z2a9pv*_ga*MjE0MDE3ODMzNy4xNzQ4OTM1ODAz*_ga_0PZM58H213*czE3NDk1NDY0MjUkbzMkZzEkdDE3NDk1NDcwNjYkajU3JGwwJGgw">issues started at around 3AM ET</a>, with multiple regions impacted globally. <a href="https://status.openai.com/">OpenAI’s own status page</a> said that some users started experiencing “elevated error rates and latency” at that time, noting that the issues were affecting ChatGPT, its Sora text-to-video AI tool, and OpenAI APIs.  OpenAI added a separate line for “elevated error rates on Sora” at 5:23AM ET, and later updated the status for both to “partial outage.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of 6:32PM ET, <a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01JXCAW3K3JAE0EP56AEZ7CBG3#updates">OpenAI’s tracker</a> reported a “full recovery in the API,” and that “Nearly all ChatGPT components are now working properly for all users.” The one spot of trouble, however, is voice mode, which still has elevated error rates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some users were able to access ChatGPT, but found that the service was sluggish and taking much longer than usual to respond. Others, like myself, were able to use the chatbot without any issues, so the outages and errors didn’t seem to impact everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perplexity, the AI search engine service that utilizes some OpenAI models, also reported experiencing outages and reporting “<a href="https://status.perplexity.com/cmbqglc8x00019b4dw876rm5a">slowness and elevated error rates</a>” on its status page. <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/perplexityai/">Perplexity’s issues started at around 7AM ET</a>, according to Downdetector.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, June 10th: </strong>Noted OpenAI and Perplexity’s status updates.</em></p>
