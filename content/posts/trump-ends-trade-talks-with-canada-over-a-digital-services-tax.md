<p>President Donald Trump said the US is ending trade talks with Canada, effective immediately, over a tax on digital services that will impact American tech companies. He also pledged to announce further tariffs on Canada within the next week, adding in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114756567645919781"><ins>Truth Social post</ins></a> that "they will be paying to do business with the United States of America."</p>
<p>Canada's digital services tax (DST) is set to take effect on June 30, though it will be applied retroactively. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/business/trump-ends-canada-trade-talks.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, US companies are preparing to pay around $2.7 billion to the Canadian government to cover a three percent tax on revenue they generated from users in the country. Companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb are subject to the levy, as things stand.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his post on Friday, Trump called the DST "a direct and blatant attack on our country." Amid trade talks with the US, Canada's finance minister, Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne, said this month that the country had <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-digital-services-tax-1.7565966"><ins>no plans to hit the pause button on the DST</ins></a>. Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney previously <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-carney-trade-war-1.7562351"><ins>said</ins></a> they aimed to reach a trade deal by around July 20.</p>
<p>Since taking office in January, Trump has been using tariffs as a negotiating tactic with other nations. The US <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/27/us-china-rare-earth-shipments-deal"><ins>reached a trade deal</ins></a> with China over rare earth minerals this week, and it is soon set to reimpose some of the levies that were <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-announces-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-excluding-china-195630212.html"><ins>put on hold in April for 90 days</ins></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DST has been a bone of contention between the US and Canada for years. The Biden administration <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/august/united-states-requests-usmca-dispute-settlement-consultations-canadas-digital-services-tax"><ins>formally challenged</ins></a> the levy last year under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other jurisdictions have considered or enacted a similar tax. It was reported in May that Germany is <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/germany-is-considering-a-10-percent-digital-service-tax-on-us-tech-giants-195705330.html"><ins>mulling a 10 percent levy</ins></a> on platforms such as Google and Facebook.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-ends-trade-talks-with-canada-over-a-digital-services-tax-192322721.html?src=rss
