<p>We <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/call-of-duty-is-getting-the-movie-treatment-courtesy-of-paramount-171408410.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">learned</a> last month that Call of Duty would be making the leap to the big screen with a planned motion picture project. Today, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported that two of the main creative forces behind the movie will be Taylor Sheridan and Peter Berg.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheridan and Berg previously both worked on the 2016 film <em>Hell or High Water</em> and 2017&#39;s <em>Wind River</em>. Berg was a producer on those projects, but he&#39;s perhaps better known as a writer for the football drama <em>Friday Night Lights</em>. Sheridan&#39;s most recent endeavor was TV series <em>Yellowstone</em>, and he also worked on <em>Lioness</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em> and <em>Tulsa King</em>. For Paramount&#39;s <em>Call of Duty</em> adaptation, both will produce and co-write, while Berg is currently on board to direct.</p><p>Since the writers and director have only just been locked down, there still hasn&#39;t been any public discussion of what era of the lucrative CoD franchise the movie will tackle. Based on the duo&#39;s past work, something contemporary seems most likely, but it may be awhile before we have any confirmation of the story or casting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/paramounts-call-of-duty-movie-taps-the-writers-of-yellowstone-and-friday-night-lights-175331091.html?src=rss
