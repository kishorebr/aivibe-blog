<p>When we say that NordVPN is a good VPN that's not quite great, it's important to put that in perspective. Building a good VPN is hard, as evidenced by all the shovelware VPNs flooding the market. NordVPN may not be perfect, but it's easily top-five caliber and excels in certain use cases.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">First, the bad: NordVPN's apps could all stand to undergo a little more quality control, with elements distracting from other elements and inconsistent designs from platform to platform. At least one of its FAQ pages directly contradicts itself. And while all the server locations could unblock Netflix, the one in Nigeria still showed U.S. content, indicating that our real location might have leaked.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">However, there's a lot of good to balance that out. Speeds are fantastic and we saw no other hint of any kind of leak. Its server network is expansive and not overly reliant on virtual locations. The vast majority of servers are ideal for unblocking foreign websites. The real draw, though, is the extra features, including the innovative and flexible Meshnet, plus a malware blocker that acts more like a full antivirus and forward-looking quantum resistant encryption.</p>

<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-nordvpn">Installing, configuring and using NordVPN</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN's biggest strengths are its speeds and the range of options it puts at your fingertips. User experience is important, but it's not quite as front-and-center as it is with ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. Here's how the apps run on all the major platforms.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The Windows app is the first instance of NordVPN's UI being not bad enough to complain about, but not good enough to be considered excellent. The initial connection process is a little slow, and it's far easier to connect than it is to disconnect (click the power button while connected to shut the VPN off). The map takes up space that would have been better allocated to the server list.</p>

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The minor problems continue in the settings list, which makes the mistake of not keeping all its tabs visible in the window — if you open one, you have to click back to the main menu to reach another page. The pages themselves are easy to use; it's just a bit clunkier than it could have been.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Setup is swift and easy on Mac, but the full NordVPN interface is a little awkward. The vast majority of the main window is taken up by a large map, which is mostly useless. There's no way to zoom out to see the whole world, and you can't choose between servers in each country unless you zoom way in. The server list on the left-hand side is almost always more useful.</p>

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The preferences panel is better. All the tabs come with clear explanations of their function, and are laid out so the menu is always visible, unlike the Windows app. The gear icon at the bottom includes its own set of tabs that encompass most of the common functions, including changing your VPN protocol, activating the kill switch and setting the VPN to automatically connect on untrusted networks.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-android">Android</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN on mobile can be described in much the same way as its desktop apps: generally great, occasionally getting in its own way. On Android, the map screen is much more helpful. It's expandable to the entire world and allows you to choose between servers within a country. On the other hand, the important settings are buried in the Profile tab, and the app notifies you about your "security score" to pressure you into activating certain settings.</p>

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">To find the general settings page on Android, tap the bottom-right Profile tab and scroll down. Except for Threat Protection, which has its own tab on the main window, every feature is located here. It's probably necessary to keep the main app from getting cluttered, but still mildly frustrating.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The NordVPN iOS app resembles a compressed version of the macOS client, for better or worse. As with Android, most of its features are in the bottom-right Profile tab. It works well most of the time, but often feels slightly cumbersome. There's a bit too much on the screen, and a bit too much of the stuff has nothing to do with the VPN's core function.</p>

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">As an example, you can't log into your account within the app — you have to load your Nord account page in a web browser. Forced app switching is a design choice that truly needs to die. That said, VPN connections happen quickly. If you tend to simply leave your VPN active, you probably won't notice any of this stuff.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Most VPN browser extensions consist of the same features on a smaller scale, and NordVPN's — on Chrome, Firefox and Edge — are no exception. They are important for one reason, though: they're the only way to split tunnels by URL and the only split tunneling at all on macOS and iOS. Despite being more compact, they're also easy to use, making for an excellent quick-start VPN solution.</p>

<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-speed-test">NordVPN speed test</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">All VPNs slow down your average browsing speeds by adding extra steps into the connection process. When we test speed, we're looking for the VPN to drag as little as possible on your unprotected speeds. Download speed will be the most important stat for most users, since that determines how fast web pages load and how quickly videos can buffer.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Latency is important for live connections like video chats, games and live streaming. Latency increases with distance — in the test below, data packets were sent to the remote server, then back to our home network. Upload speeds likewise influence your live two-way communications and are also vital for torrenting. Let's see how NordVPN performs on all three metrics.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">To summarize: NordVPN's download speeds are the fastest we've seen and its upload speeds and latency tie with the best. Downloads only dropped by an average of 6.4 percent across the globe and readings were mostly consistent — the servers in question performed much the same in each test. We even threw in Turkey and South Africa, two locations that commonly cause problems, but NordVPN still kept the drop to 10 percent.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Latency is more a product of physical distance than VPN infrastructure, but you can still see differences between services. When tested on a similar range of locations, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both kept average latencies under 300 ms. NordVPN's average came out to 326 milliseconds, though we should note that its latency increased less than Proton's on the closest server.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Upload speeds declined an average of four percent, but there were a few anomalously high readings in Istanbul that skewed those numbers up. Without that location, NordVPN's upload rates would also have been the industry's current best.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-security-test">NordVPN security test</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">No matter how well-built a VPN looks from the outside, there are several ways its security can fail. The most common problems are outdated protocols with weak encryption, failing to block IPv6 traffic or inadvertent leaks from sending DNS requests outside the encrypted tunnel. We'll start by looking for those common leak sources, then check whether NordVPN's encryption might be failing in less traceable ways.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">A VPN protocol is a set of rules used to get data quickly and safely from your device to a VPN server and back, even while that data is encrypted. Different protocols are connected with different encryption algorithms and can impact the speed, security and stability of your connection.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">When testing VPN security, the first step is to see if it's using any protocols like PPTP that are outdated and crackable, or homebrewed protocols with unclear security. NordVPN users have four options for protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 (not available on Mac or iOS), NordLynx and NordWhisper (available on Windows, Android and Linux only).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">OpenVPN and IKEv2 are both standard protocols you'll find on most VPN providers. Both use various strengths of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with OpenVPN defaulting to AES-256 and IKEv2 to AES-128. OpenVPN can be set to UDP (faster but less stable) or TCP (more reliable but slower). So far, so secure.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordLynx is unique to NordVPN, but it's not that far off the beaten track — it's just WireGuard with extra security. WireGuard normally works by saving a stable IP address for each connection, which raises the very slight risk of exposing a user. <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.01net.com/en/vpn/nordvpn/nordlynx/">NordLynx adds a second layer of abstraction</a> that means those stable addresses are never revealed. Since NordVPN strongly recommends it for most situations, we used it for all our tests in this review.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Finally, there's <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpns-nordwhisper-protocol-can-get-around-vpn-blockers-162525626.html">NordWhisper</a>, a new protocol introduced in early 2025 that disguises your VPN traffic as normal web traffic to evade blanket web blocks. It's likely to be slower than the other protocols, so don't use it unless everything else has been blocked. We also don't recommend counting on it too much in general — large-scale censorship technology, like the Great Firewall of China, tends to rely on blocklists of known VPN servers, whose identity NordWhisper can't disguise.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Our first order of business was to check five test servers to see if they leaked our real IP address — staying away from the ones in the speed test in order to get as comprehensive a picture of NordVPN's security as possible. With help from ipleak.net, we found all five to be free of the three major types of leaks.</p> 
<ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul" style="margin:16px 0px;padding:0px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);"> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-reset public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;counter-reset:ol0 0;"><p><strong>DNS leaks</strong> occur when a VPN sends DNS requests (in short, how your browser knows which websites to show you) outside its encrypted tunnel. By default, NordVPN uses its own private DNS servers, which our tests showed to effectively prevent leaks.</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>WebRTC leaks</strong> are caused by real-time communication protocols sending information outside the VPN, which may reveal your real IP address.

 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>IPv6 leaks</strong> happen when a VPN only blocks IPv4 traffic and lets v6 through.

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Although that's all great news, it is still possible for leaks to occur without a clear explanation, so we ran one final test on NordVPN.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Wireshark is a program that captures detailed images of information sent over a device's internet connection. Even though our tests showed NordVPN to be free of leaks, we wanted to inspect it at the most granular level. Using WireShark, we recorded the traffic sent to an unencrypted HTTP site, before and after connecting to each NordVPN test server.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Every server showed the same pattern: readable plaintext before, encrypted ciphertext after. If there is a security flaw remaining in NordVPN, it's unlikely to be relevant to the overwhelming majority of users.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-how-much-does-nordvpn-cost">How much does NordVPN cost?</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN's pricing structure looks convoluted at first, but it's much simpler than it appears. A Basic subscription gets you full VPN functionality, and all the other tiers just add more features. If all you need is a VPN, you only need to concern yourself with the left side of the table below.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The best deal for a Basic NordVPN subscription, which lets you connect to NordVPN with up to 10 devices at once, costs $81.36 for two years when you pay upfront ($3.39 per month). One year of the same plan costs $59.88 in advance ($4.99 per month) or $12.99 for one month at a time. The table below shows the complete cost; for more information on plans above Basic, see "side apps and bundles" in the next section.</p>

<p>The longer plans save money, but be careful: if you let them expire, you'll automatically renew at the <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://my.nordaccount.com/legal/pricing/?_gl=1*11f3qq8*_gcl_au*ODY4NDU0ODMwLjE3NDUzNTgxOTU.*FPAU*ODY4NDU0ODMwLjE3NDUzNTgxOTU.*_ga*MjAxMjQxMzk3NS4xNzQ4MzczNzE3*_ga_LEXMJ1N516*czE3NDg5Nzk3MjYkbzQkZzEkdDE3NDg5Nzk3MjYkajYwJGwwJGgw&amp;_ga=2.210830941.912050247.1748979726-2012413975.1748373717&amp;nv_tri=TC_8006072161444097_1748373716505&amp;nv_trs=1748979725618_1748979727570_4_3">more expensive one-year plan</a>. Enough customers claim to have been auto-renewed at the higher rate that they've launched a <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vpns/world-famous-vpn-company-embroiled-in-class-action-lawsuit">class-action lawsuit</a> against NordVPN, accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices and making renewals too difficult to cancel. A NordVPN PR rep said they could not comment on ongoing legal action, "other than to state that we are and always have been very clear about the recurring nature of our services." No court date has been set so far.</p> 
<p>That said, there's a fairly straightforward workaround in the meantime: To prevent the auto renewal, log out of your NordVPN account, then sign up for a discounted plan again using the same email. As long as you do this before your subscription expires, your new account should link to your old one, keeping you subscribed at the introductory rate.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-free-trials-and-refunds">Free trials and refunds</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Every NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you cancel and request a refund before 30 days are up, you'll get the full cost back. The only way to try it for free without paying is to get the app on Android, where there's a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=seven-day+trial+through+the+Google+Play+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTk3NDQ4MzcwOTEyMTctRG9lcy1Ob3JkVlBOLWhhdmUtYS1mcmVlLXRyaWFsIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDNiZTAxNC1kMTRiLTRhYzItYWQ1ZC00YWUzYWE3M2NjMTQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3VwcG9ydC5ub3JkdnBuLmNvbS9oYy9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xOTc0NDgzNzA5MTIxNy1Eb2VzLU5vcmRWUE4taGF2ZS1hLWZyZWUtdHJpYWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXOytfzy7QsgQJ5hrRTc80-EcF7sdHOOfu8sQnJognqg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F19744837091217-Does-NordVPN-have-a-free-trial" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19744837091217-Does-NordVPN-have-a-free-trial">seven-day trial through the Google Play Store</a>.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-side-apps-and-bundles">NordVPN side apps and bundles</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN is part of a larger family of Nord Security products, which you can save money on if you need more than one. We won't review all of them here, but for reference, here's everything you'll get from the higher subscription tiers.&nbsp;</p> 
<ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul" style="margin:16px 0px;padding:0px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);"> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-reset public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;counter-reset:ol0 0;"><p>Basic: VPN on 10 devices, specialty servers, DNS ad-blocking, Meshnet</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p>Plus: All Basic features, plus malware scanning, extra scam blocking, tracker blocking, NordPass password manager, data breach scanner</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p>Complete: All Plus features, along with 1TB of NordLocker encrypted cloud storage</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p>Prime: All Complete features, plus NordProtect features like dark web monitoring, credit monitoring, ID theft insurance and extortion insurance</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Another tier called Ultra includes a subscription to Incogni, a data removal service run by Nord's partner Surfshark. The Ultra bundle is only available in certain countries, since NordVPN is still testing it; users outside the test countries can still add Incogni service at checkout. There also used to be a NordVPN family plan, but it seems to have been eliminated after Nord expanded the devices per subscription to 10.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">You can get a dedicated IP address on NordVPN to ensure you have the same IP every time you connect. This lets you configure remote firewalls to let you through while you're connected to the VPN. A dedicated IP costs $8.99 per month, $70.68 for a year ($5.89 per month) or $100.56 for two years ($4.19 per month).</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The NordVPN pricing page lists access to a Saily eSIM plan as a perk, though mysteriously, none of the existing plans seem to include it yet. A lot of VPNs are expanding into the eSIM space, so this may change soon.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-close-reading-nordvpns-privacy-policy">Close-reading NordVPN's privacy policy</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">A VPN privacy policy isn't just empty words — it's a contract between the provider and its users. If a service openly defied its own policy, it could be sued for false advertising. VPNs tend to sneak loopholes into their privacy policies instead of flouting them outright; these loopholes can shed light on how the provider actually views your privacy.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We combed through NordVPN's privacy policy to see whether it tries to take any such liberties. The policy has two parts: the <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://my.nordaccount.com/legal/privacy-policy/">general Nord Security policy</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://my.nordaccount.com/legal/privacy-policy/nordvpn/">an addendum specific to NordVPN</a>.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-general-nord-privacy-policy">General Nord privacy policy</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">This policy applies to all Nord Security apps. It's impossible to create an account without a valid email address, but you can use a separate <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fastmail-1password-masked-email-110028257.html">email masking service</a> to make that anonymous. The policy also explicitly says that your email address will be added to a marketing mailing list, though you can opt out. Irritating, but not a privacy risk in itself.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We're more concerned about the later statement that it may process data without the user's consent "under the legal basis of our or third parties' legitimate interest." This clause covers some cases we'd agree are legitimate, such as identifying people who launch cyberattacks from NordVPN servers. But Nord also considers it "legitimate interest" to process your personal data "to improve or maintain our services and provide new products and features."</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Reached for comment, a NordVPN representative said that using personal data in this way "generally involves aggregated, depersonalized or technical information." That's somewhat reassuring, but the "generally" leaves a bit too much wiggle room. Ideally, we'd prefer that personal data exist wholly in the "consent only" section.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The section on sharing your data with third parties only lists "some of" the service providers who may receive your information. Among these are Google Analytics, which is known to <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/google-analytics-and-gdpr-compliance-rulings/">store personal data on U.S. servers</a> — all of which are potential security risks in the <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-whats-up-doge-diving-into-elon-musks-hack-on-america-123006530.html">age of DOGE</a>. Other unnamed "third parties" are involved in targeting ads at users of Nord websites.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The NordVPN representative said that "since some partners, such as payment processors, can vary by region or specific service and may change over time depending on our operational needs, we do not publish a fixed list." They added that all third parties are "contractually required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards."</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We aren't using this to condemn Nord; many of these practices are fairly standard in the VPN industry. But it's important to know about all the potential leakage points before trusting your deepest secrets to any company.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-specific-policies">NordVPN specific policies</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The NordVPN privacy policy doesn't add much atop the general Nord notice. It does track session activity connected to your username to make sure you're staying within the 10-device limit, but it automatically deletes these logs 15 minutes after you disconnect. The logs also don't include your IP address or the addresses of VPN servers you used.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The only real problem we found is that NordVPN apps collect information about your activity on the app by default. This doesn't include information about your browsing habits, but it does include unique traits that could conceivably be used for <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-cracking-down-on-fingerprinting-with-new-app-store-api-rules-080007498.html">"device fingerprinting"</a> — in which a third party can deduce a user's identity through clues about their device. You can turn this off in the General settings.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">A NordVPN spokesperson told us that the data collected is "not personally identifiable," and that the company takes "deliberate steps to strip out anything that could be linked back to a specific person." This presumably means the data is aggregated so it only shows general trends, not any one device's activity. That's a lot less risky, but we still recommend switching the setting off.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-third-party-privacy-audits">Third-party privacy audits</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN has passed five independent audits of its privacy policy so far, most recently <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NordVPN;elmt:;cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;linkText=from+Deloitte+in+late+2024&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL2Jsb2cvbm9yZHZwbi1uby1sb2dzLWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDNiZTAxNC1kMTRiLTRhYzItYWQ1ZC00YWUzYWE3M2NjMTQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZHZwbi5jb20vYmxvZy9ub3JkdnBuLW5vLWxvZ3MtYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5aMjTJ9jhGJXJM1LlnC8fU5ZDQl-Jdipzinw3a84_Z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fnordvpn-no-logs-audit-2024%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordvpn-no-logs-audit-2024/">from Deloitte in late 2024</a>. Annoyingly, you can only read the entire report by logging into a Nord account, but it at least doesn't have to be a paid account.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The audit found that NordVPN was following its own no-logs policy. Specifically, the Deloitte Lithuania investigators concluded that "the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the NordVPN's description set out in the Appendix I." (Appendix I of the report is identical to NordVPN's privacy policy.)</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-can-nordvpn-change-your-virtual-location">Can NordVPN change your virtual location?</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">You'll be most interested in this section if you mainly use a VPN to change their location for streaming. To see if NordVPN could unlock new streaming libraries, we picked a new batch of five test servers, then logged onto Netflix. Since Netflix tries to block all VPN servers to prevent copyright issues, our first question was whether we'd get through at all.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Our second question: would connecting to a NordVPN server actually change what Netflix library we saw? It should, given that NordVPN seems leak-proof, but thoroughness demands we check anyway. Here's what we found.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Four out of five locations worked perfectly. On a Canadian server, we were able to stream <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation, </em>which left American Netflix years ago. The Argentine server gave us access to something called <em>Pasion de Gavilanes, </em>which we'd never heard of but sounds great.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The only problem was Nigeria. We tested it several times, connected to multiple different Nigerian locations, but saw our American Netflix library every time. We then ran a leak test on Nigeria, which wasn't one of our security test locations, and found it to be working normally. It's hard to say what happened, especially since the Nigeria server doesn't appear to be virtual, but we can confirm that it wasn't working.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-investigating-nordvpns-server-network">Investigating NordVPN's server network</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN has servers in 153 cities in 117 countries. Out of all total options, 62 are virtual locations (about 40 percent), where the server is really located somewhere else. This makes it possible to get servers into more places, but depending on your actual location relative to the server, it may perform differently than you expect.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Virtual locations have allowed NordVPN's server network to grow quite extensive, with lots more locations in South America, Africa and Asia than the industry standard. Check out the distribution in the table.</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The relatively low proportion of virtual locations (nearly identical to that of ExpressVPN) is a good sign, as it means NordVPN has been growing its server network thoughtfully. Some VPNs — looking at you, HMA — inflate their server lists as a marketing point without seriously considering what it takes to maintain such a large network. That thankfully doesn't seem to be the case here.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-extra-features-of-nordvpn">Extra features of NordVPN</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Here's everything you get with a NordVPN app other than the VPN itself. There's a lot going on here, so we'll limit ourselves to a sketch of each feature.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-specialty-servers">Specialty servers</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">As soon as you load NordVPN, you'll see a list of special servers near the top of the right-hand column. We'll go over each of them in order.</p> 
<ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul" style="margin:16px 0px;padding:0px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);"> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-reset public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;counter-reset:ol0 0;"><p><strong>Dedicated IP:</strong> As discussed in the bundles section, a dedicated IP address costs extra. With this, you'll always connect with the same IP, which is private to you alone. It may be worth the price if you find yourself getting asked for CAPTCHAs a lot more while connected to NordVPN — though for what it's worth, that didn't happen to us.</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>Double VPN: </strong>This sends your connection through a second VPN server before it reaches your ISP. The second server is your apparent location. There are 10 endpoints to choose from. As you might imagine, your internet will run slower with two VPN servers in the mix, so only use this if you seriously need security.</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>Obfuscated servers: </strong>These are only available on OpenVPN. Obfuscation can help you get around firewalls that seek out and block VPN traffic. If you can't get online with NordVPN when you're on a certain network, obfuscated servers might work.</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>Onion Over VPN: </strong>After encrypting your data as normal, these servers send it through several nodes of the Tor network, granting you the total anonymity of onion routing while keeping you safe from malicious relays. It's available in two locations, Netherlands and Switzerland, and — like double VPN — is best used only when you need the utmost privacy.</p></li> 
 <li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" style="direction:ltr;list-style-type:disc;position:relative;margin-left:1.5em;"><p><strong>P2P: </strong>NordVPN only allows torrenting on its peer-to-peer servers, but fortunately, it's got P2P servers in 114 countries — only three fewer than it has in total. NordVPN keeps your download and upload speeds very fast on average, so you shouldn't have trouble torrenting from any location.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-meshnet">Meshnet</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Meshnet is NordVPN's most unique and exciting feature by a long shot. By logging into the same NordVPN account on multiple devices, you can connect those devices directly through a NordLynx tunnel without needing a NordVPN server in between.</p> 
<figure>

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Essentially, you're using your own devices as VPN servers — obviously not great for privacy, but amazing for accessing web services in other countries. While two devices are connected, you can transfer files between them through the NordLynx tunnel. You can even invite friends and use their devices.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-threat-protection">Threat Protection</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN has two levels of antivirus: Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro. The former is a simple DNS filter that stops your browsing from loading unsafe web pages while NordVPN is active. It's the highest level available on Android, iOS and Linux, or on any Basic subscription.</p> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c8fa70-4876-11f0-b7e9-5aa6c277a330" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c8fa70-4876-11f0-b7e9-5aa6c277a330" style="height:1393px;width:1798px;" alt="NordVPN Threat Protection" data-uuid="9c42cbda-2aa5-3c7e-a7b0-d76d377cb189">

</figure> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Threat Protection Pro, which Plus subscribers or higher can set up on Windows and Mac, can work even when you aren't connected to a NordVPN server. It acts more like a standalone antivirus by scanning downloaded files for malware, and can even block trackers. Basic Threat Protection (without Pro) can block some trackers by filtering out domains known to use them, but doesn't block the trackers directly.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-dark-web-monitor">Dark Web Monitor</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">While active, Dark Web Monitor continually searches known data breach dump sites on the dark web and notifies you if it ever finds your account email address. If you get that notification, change any passwords associated with the address. With a Prime subscription, you can also have it search for your phone number, social security number or other financial information.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-presets">Presets</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Presets let you set up one-click VPN connections with a desired group of settings, a lot like Proton VPN's Profiles. NordVPN comes pre-loaded with presets that optimize for "Downloads," "Speed" and "Browsing," which sounds to us like the same thing three times.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">More usefully, you can create presets for particular countries, then add website shortcuts that will appear once you've connected. You could, for example, set one that connects to a specific location, then add a shortcut to a streaming site available in that location.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-post-quantum-encryption">Post-Quantum encryption</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Experts widely believe that quantum computers will eventually make our current encryption algorithms obsolete, but <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat">there's almost no consensus on when that will actually happen</a> — except that it hasn't happened yet. Knowing that, NordVPN's "post-quantum encryption" feature comes across as a bit premature, but it's reassuring that someone is thinking about it.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Having said that, we don't recommend using post-quantum encryption yet. It works by layering one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards">known quantum-proof encryption standards</a> on top of a standard NordLynx session, which makes your VPN connection slower and more erratic. Until we can verify a real quantum cyberattack, post-quantum encryption is a needless precaution.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">A kill switch cuts off your internet the instant you lose your connection to a NordVPN server. This protects you in case a server unexpectedly fails, and as a side benefit, prevents you from connecting to any fake VPN servers. You should keep the kill switch on at all times.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Split tunneling is available on NordVPN's Windows and Android apps (and Android TV by extension), along with its browser extensions. On Windows and Android, it splits by app: you can determine which apps get online through the VPN and which go unprotected. The browser extensions let you split by URL, so the VPN only protects certain sites.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-customer-support-options">NordVPN customer support options</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN's apps link directly to its online help center. As always, we went in with a specific question in mind: whether the basic level of Threat Protection could block trackers, and if so, what kind. We found the categories on the written support page difficult to parse, especially the troubleshooting section — would the average user appreciate the difference between "app issues," "connection issues" and "errors"?</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We correctly guessed that our question would be under "Using NordVPN -&gt; Features," but the introductory article on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Threat+Protection+and+Threat+Protection+Pro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTk1MDg3NjU1MjE0MjUtV2hhdC1pcy1UaHJlYXQtUHJvdGVjdGlvbi1Qcm8tYW5kLVRocmVhdC1Qcm90ZWN0aW9uIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDNiZTAxNC1kMTRiLTRhYzItYWQ1ZC00YWUzYWE3M2NjMTQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3VwcG9ydC5ub3JkdnBuLmNvbS9oYy9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xOTUwODc2NTUyMTQyNS1XaGF0LWlzLVRocmVhdC1Qcm90ZWN0aW9uLVByby1hbmQtVGhyZWF0LVByb3RlY3Rpb24ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZMeYDVQCpmEPMecPPSPEkuOCi1HM21pBL1u2XPt3JTj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F19508765521425-What-is-Threat-Protection-Pro-and-Threat-Protection" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19508765521425-What-is-Threat-Protection-Pro-and-Threat-Protection">Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro</a> was buried at the bottom of the list. Unfortunately, that made things more confusing, as this article says that Threat Protection (not Pro) both does and doesn't block trackers. In NordVPN's favor, however, using the search bar brought us instantly back to that article without any confusion.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-the-live-support-experience">The live support experience</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Using NordVPN's live chat was a smooth and reassuring experience. From the time we decided to ask directly, it took us less than a minute to connect with a real person, who quickly cleared up the confusion and promised to update the confusing support page (we'll check back to see if they actually do).</p>

<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">One other option is an email support form, which can be found both on the website and in the help sections of NordVPN apps. This is best for complex problems that require screenshots to explain, and promises a response within 24 hours.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-nordvpn-background-check">NordVPN background check</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN was founded in 2012. Launching with its desktop apps, it moved to iOS and Android in 2016, then added apps for browser extensions and smart TVs. Its developer, Nord Security, has no parent company, and its history is relatively uncontroversial. We've documented two notable incidents below, plus more about Nord Security's operations.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-headquarters-and-ownership">Headquarters and ownership</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Nord Security was founded in Lithuania, and maintains offices there. Although Nord Security is <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://nordsecurity.com/impressum">registered in Amsterdam</a>, NordVPN operates under <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=a+separate+license+in+Panama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTk0NDExNTI5NjYxNjEtV2hlcmUtaXMtTm9yZFZQTi1iYXNlZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmQzYmUwMTQtZDE0Yi00YWMyLWFkNWQtNGFlM2FhNzNjYzE0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTk0NDExNTI5NjYxNjEtV2hlcmUtaXMtTm9yZFZQTi1iYXNlZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfQzp1xYdXmhXg9Vf3iG0pJ0z3zkoItOWVnNqagf0_R_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F19441152966161-Where-is-NordVPN-based" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19441152966161-Where-is-NordVPN-based">a separate license in Panama</a>, which makes any data requests subject to Panama's courts.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-finland-server-breach">Finland server breach</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">The first serious incident in NordVPN's history began in March 2018, when unidentified hackers managed to <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/hackers-steal-secret-crypto-keys-for-nordvpn-heres-what-we-know-so-far/">steal three private keys</a> from one of Nord's data centers in Finland. Researchers didn't notice the leak until October 2019, well after the stolen keys had expired, but NordVPN's encryption was still technically vulnerable for several months.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We say "technically," because <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/after-the-breach-nord-is-asking-users-to-trust-it-again/">it was really only the outer layer of encryption</a> — and even if they'd broken through it all, the hackers would only have seen browsing activity, not usernames, passwords or anything else sensitive. If anything, NordVPN's response actually makes us trust it more. It ended its relationship with the contractor who ran the Finnish data center and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NordVPN;elmt:;cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;linkText=revamped+its+policies&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL2Jsb2cvb2ZmaWNpYWwtcmVzcG9uc2UtZGF0YWNlbnRlci1icmVhY2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDNiZTAxNC1kMTRiLTRhYzItYWQ1ZC00YWUzYWE3M2NjMTQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZHZwbi5jb20vYmxvZy9vZmZpY2lhbC1yZXNwb25zZS1kYXRhY2VudGVyLWJyZWFjaC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZCFIWQmroMWESJeANLGlKPLhG0fp6oO22nMe1MfF5BD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fofficial-response-datacenter-breach%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nordvpn.com/blog/official-response-datacenter-breach/">revamped its policies</a> to eliminate the kind of negligence that led to the breach.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Arguably, its only real error was not immediately disclosing the breach. NordVPN learned about the leak and started addressing it in May 2018, but the news didn't break until more than a year later. That timing probably made it look more suspicious than any actual mishandling did.</p> 
<h3 class="" style="" id="jump-link-law-enforcement-compliance">Law enforcement compliance</h3> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">Another minor controversy erupted in 2022, when <a data-i13n="cpos:38;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nordvpn-actually-we-do-comply-with-law-enforcement-data-requests">PCMag and other outlets</a> reported that NordVPN had edited its website to say that it would comply with data requests from law enforcement. NordVPN responded with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NordVPN;elmt:;cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;linkText=a+new+post&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL2Jsb2cvaG93LW5vcmR2cG4tcHJvdGVjdHMtdGhlLXByaXZhY3ktb2YtaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJkM2JlMDE0LWQxNGItNGFjMi1hZDVkLTRhZTNhYTczY2MxNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3JkdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL2hvdy1ub3JkdnBuLXByb3RlY3RzLXRoZS1wcml2YWN5LW9mLWl0cy1jdXN0b21lcnMvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWfKv_2Gwo6KHdS1K3RMoMoLOrBdASnp4-qzqn22Sfh3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-nordvpn-protects-the-privacy-of-its-customers%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nordvpn.com/blog/how-nordvpn-protects-the-privacy-of-its-customers/">a new post</a> that said nothing had changed: their policy was always to comply with lawful requests, which — provided the requests were lawfully submitted through a Panamanian court — is literally their only option.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">We're inclined to agree. VPNs are legal companies. They wouldn't last long if they openly declared their intent to break the law. The key is that when law enforcement comes calling, there shouldn't be anything to show them, as with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ExpressVPN;elmt:;cpos:40;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd3be014-d14b-4ac2-ad5d-4ae3aa73cc14&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;linkText=the+Turkish+seizure+of+ExpressVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL2V4cHJlc3N2cG4tc3RhdGVtZW50LWFuZHJleS1rYXJsb3YtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi8_c3JzbHRpZD1BZm1CT29xMllhaHR5MENybE5KV0RKNEJ0NzdCa0E4bTJHM3c5TXlncng3X3lyX09vZHFVek1qeSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmQzYmUwMTQtZDE0Yi00YWMyLWFkNWQtNGFlM2FhNzNjYzE0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL2V4cHJlc3N2cG4tc3RhdGVtZW50LWFuZHJleS1rYXJsb3YtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi8_c3JzbHRpZD1BZm1CT29xMllhaHR5MENybE5KV0RKNEJ0NzdCa0E4bTJHM3c5TXlncng3X3lyX09vZHFVek1qeSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATw-XTSjtJjdbnrfpQLcm6IydrwMxvyXPCHjHWGrlEgJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fexpressvpn-statement-andrey-karlov-investigation%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoq2Yahty0CrlNJWDJ4Bt77BkA8m2G3w9Mygrx7_yr_OodqUzMjy" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/expressvpn-statement-andrey-karlov-investigation/?srsltid=AfmBOoq2Yahty0CrlNJWDJ4Bt77BkA8m2G3w9Mygrx7_yr_OodqUzMjy">the Turkish seizure of ExpressVPN</a>. That's why verifiable no-logging policies are so important.</p> 
<h2 class="" style="" id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN is a great service on its own merits. It only suffers from having to be compared with the likes of ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. For example, its P2P servers are good for torrenting, but not as useful without Proton's port forwarding. It's fast, but speed tests fluctuated just a little more than Express.</p> 
<p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" style="position:relative;white-space:pre-wrap;direction:ltr;text-align:left;">NordVPN's extra features are the best reason to pick it over its rivals. With Meshnet, you can theoretically set up a VPN connection anywhere in the world, and no other VPN has anything close to Meshnet's file transfer powers. Threat Protection Pro is also great if you can get it, adding file scanning to bolster the typical approach of just blocking suspicious DNS addresses. Specialty servers round out the offering, with double VPN maintaining good speeds with extra safety and Onion over VPN being among the safest ways to use Tor.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html?src=rss
