<p>Curious to see if those <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> rumors are true? You may not have long to wait. Xbox&#39;s presentation at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 is fast approaching. You can watch the event live right here on September 25 at 6AM ET.</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mwaks7/forza_horizon_6_is_finally_going_to_japan_as_car/">rumored</a> to have a Japan setting, making this week&#39;s event a logical venue for its announcement. That&#39;s not the only thing to go on. <em>Windows Central</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/report-forza-horizon-6-may-be-announced-this-year-in-the-same-place-the-game-is-set">reported</a> last month that it had seen official documentation suggesting the game would be announced at the Tokyo Game Show. An Xbox executive producer even posted earlier this month that it would be an event &quot;you don&#39;t want to miss.&quot; (Am I sadistic for hoping he was hyping up something like a new <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-will-let-you-pin-up-to-three-favorite-games-to-your-homescreen-200051956.html">Xbox dashboard</a> feature?)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Xbox brand could use some positive mojo. Last week, Microsoft announced that it would <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">raise console prices for the second time</a> in less than five months. The increase, which begins on October 3, was &quot;due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.&quot; (That sounds like a copywriter&#39;s answer to &quot;How do you say &#39;tariffs&#39; without actually saying &#39;tariffs?&#39;&quot;) It&#39;s all the more reason the company would love to shift your focus to something fun.</p>
<p>You can stream Microsoft&#39;s event below on September 25 at 6AM ET.</p>
