<p>The price for a PS4 copy of  the relatively obscure Star Wars racing game, <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge</em>, has dramatically increased in the last few days because of the game’s use in the latest PlayStation 5 jailbreak, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>. The PS2 game was originally released in 2002, and was ported to PS4 by Limited Run Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/blogs/news/hone-your-podracing-skills-in-star-wars-racer-revenge" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2019</a>. Its role as a key ingredient in the jailbreaking process <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">was announced</a> on December 31.</p><p>Interested jailbreakers need <em>Racer Revenge</em> to jailbreak PS5 12.00 firmware because of a bug in the game&#39;s Hall of Fame feature, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. The bug makes it possible to inject new code into Sony&#39;s console, and because the PS5 is able to load and play PS4 discs, <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge </em>is an easier method to pull the jailbreak off. Retail releases of games are a common way to execute exploits and hacks because, unlike digital copies, they can’t be directly patched.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxim4wOtrlw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>While the PS4 version of <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge</em> was available for anywhere between <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">$14.99</a> to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-premium-edition-ps4" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">$37.50</a> when it went on sale originally, used copies are currently listed for as high as $411 <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5a36d98f-e3c9-4ccc-96f8-f261b8484c73&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ef903ed8-28dd-49c4-af49-009dde354f12&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=eBay&amp;linkText=on+eBay&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYmF5LmNvbS9zY2gvaS5odG1sP19ua3c9c3Rhcit3YXJzK3JhY2VyK3JldmVuZ2UrcHM0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjkwM2VkOC0yOGRkLTQ5YzQtYWY0OS0wMDlkZGUzNTRmMTIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmViYXkuY29tL3NjaC9pLmh0bWw_X25rdz1zdGFyK3dhcnMrcmFjZXIrcmV2ZW5nZStwczQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARZpFiZnYcgSgN9U9tTUARfBrdPbYJqVuntK1lqsUl4P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Dstar%2Bwars%2Bracer%2Brevenge%2Bps4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:eBay;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=star+wars+racer+revenge+ps4">on eBay</a>. Sellers are naturally trying to capitalize on the game&#39;s new position in the jailbreaking meta and raising the price accordingly. Of course, it helps that there&#39;s only a small number of copies to go around. </p><p>As the company&#39;s name suggests, Limited Run Games releases old games in limited quantities as collector items.
