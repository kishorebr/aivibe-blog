According to the tech company, the transition to the new provider should take about two years to complete, but customers can continue to use their Apple Cards as usual during the interim.&nbsp;Apple has already published an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://learn.applecard.apple/transition" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">FAQ</a> about the change, but the main takeaway is that the status quo is currently continuing and customers will receive information at a later date if any action is required. Mastercard will remain the Apple Card payment network under the new partnership.</p><p>Goldman Sachs was Apple&#39;s collaborator when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-apple-card.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">launched</a> the Apple Card in 2019.

Apple didn&#39;t disclose many details around either the current or future deals for its credit card, however the <em>WSJ</em> report claims the negotiations with JPMorgan Chase have been underway for more than a year. Sources told the publication that Goldman Sachs is offloading about $20 billion in outstanding customer balances at a discount of more than $1 billion. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/jpmorgan-chase-is-taking-over-the-apple-card-232711979.html?src=rss
