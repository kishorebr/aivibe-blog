<p>While many of us soldier on with the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-review-a-half-step-backward-for-capcom-remakes-070100973.html">remakes</a> and VR takes on the Resident Evil story, Capcom is prepping the next chapter of the story: <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>. The sequel was fully revealed as part of Summer Game Fest Live, kicking off a week(ish) of gaming announcements and release dates.</p>
<p>Intercutting the starting moments of REs of the past, Capcom did a fake-out, teasing that we&#39;d have to wait a little longer to see <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> — it turns out they only meant a 30-minute wait.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The teaser trailer raised more questions than answers, teasing locations from previous games, like Raccoon City — and its ruined police department. It appears the game will follow Grace Ashcroft, as she tries unveil grim mysteries and, er,  gets kidnapped. She&#39;s the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft — a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://capcom.fandom.com/wiki/Alyssa_Ashcroft">Resident Evil character</a> that I do not remember at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Capcom confirmed a year ago that veteran director Koshi Nakanishi will lead what is <em>definitely </em>not the ninth chapter of Resident Evil. (If you don&#39;t count <em>Code Veronica</em>, who even are you?) Nakanishi was involved in the development of R<em>esident Evil Revelations </em>and<em> Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, among other Resident Evil titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 9 i</em>s set to launch on February 27, 2026, but a demo will be playable in August at Gamescom, so book your tickets for Cologne, Germany.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-announced-at-summer-game-fest-2025-231136129.html?src=rss
