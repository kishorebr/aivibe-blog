<p>Washington state residents may soon be forced to produce IDs before getting onto websites with pornographic content. Within the state&#39;s House of Representatives, Rep. Mari Leavitt introduced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=2112&amp;Year=2025&amp;Initiative=false">House Bill 2112</a>, which is informally known as the Keep Our Children Safe Act. Similar to the initiatives seen in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/louisiana-government-id-to-access-porn-online-065536172.html">other states</a>, the bill proposes to restrict access to &quot;online sexual material harmful&quot; to anyone under 18.</p>
<p>In practical terms, those living in Washington state could see websites asking for digital identification or demanding the user go through an age verification system that requests a government-issued ID. If a website that has more than one-third of its content being &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; is found not following these rules, the state&#39;s attorney general can pursue steep civil penalties.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If those restrictions sound familiar, it&#39;s because many <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">other states</a> have also passed similar constraints. Washington state&#39;s proposed bill is very similar to Texas&#39; age verification law that went into effect in September 2023 and was recently upheld by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/supreme-court-upholds-texass-porn-site-age-verification-law-155007840.html">US Supreme Court</a>. Like the Texas law, several groups expressed disapproval of the bill during the public hearing at the House committee level. As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-age-verification-bill-targets-access-to-online-adult-content/"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a><em>, </em>groups including the ACLU, Lavender Rights Project and the Northwest Progressive Institute warned of privacy risks related to potential data breaches and the loose definition of &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; in the bill&#39;s language.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/washington-is-the-latest-state-pursuing-an-age-verification-law-for-porn-sites-174423529.html?src=rss
