<p>Elon Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013034224828215706"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that Tesla will be restarting work on Dojo3, the third generation of its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html"><ins>in-house supercomputer project</ins></a>. The Dojo team had been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/tesla-shuts-down-in-house-dojo-ai-supercomputer-project-155420734.html"><ins>disbanded last year</ins></a> as the company prioritized the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-wins-165-billion-deal-to-make-teslas-ai6-chips-124515017.html"><ins>AI chips</ins></a> that run on board Tesla vehicles. Musk said the company is returning to the project &quot;now that the AI5 chip design is in good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of the Dojo project is to process video recordings and other data from Tesla vehicles and use that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html"><ins>to train</ins></a> the &quot;neural net&quot; behind the company&#39;s Full Self-Driving software. Last year, however, Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that &quot;It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs. The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AI chips Musk is referring to are ones <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-02-tesla-is-quietly-making-its-own-ai-chip-for-self-driving-cars.html"><ins>developed for running FSD</ins></a> onboard Tesla vehicles and are not optimized for training. The AI6 chips will be <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-wins-165-billion-deal-to-make-teslas-ai6-chips-124515017.html"><ins>made by Samsung</ins></a> in the company&#39;s Texas factory, after it struck a $16 billion agreement with Tesla.</p>
<p>Musk has also claimed a lot of things over the years, and many of those assertions either were misrepresentations or simply didn&#39;t pan out. Working against this chip project: Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2012756384559817033"><ins>said</ins></a> that Dojo3 will be &quot;space-based AI compute,&quot; as he <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=55d30955-bdc6-4ff8-adb4-b5acdd5e0c7e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=and+others+believe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzAxL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvc3BhY2UtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXJzLWFpLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1ZDMwOTU1LWJkYzYtNGZmOC1hZGI0LWI1YWNkZDVlMGM3ZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyNi8wMS8wMS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NwYWNlLWRhdGEtY2VudGVycy1haS5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYdqHii_Sg1J6lzzAMVxJwwBpWHC-lQ7JcYLygXHz0fw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F01%2F01%2Ftechnology%2Fspace-data-centers-ai.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/01/technology/space-data-centers-ai.html"><ins>and others believe</ins></a> that <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/ai-spacex-elon-musk-data-centers"><ins>data centers in orbit</ins></a> are a superior alternative to the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-announces-huge-new-data-centers-but-they-could-gobble-up-millions-of-gallons-of-water-per-day-174000478.html"><ins>land-based behemoths</ins></a> currently being built.
