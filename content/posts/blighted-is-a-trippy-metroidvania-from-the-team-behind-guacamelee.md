<p>Drinkbox Studios is back with a new title called <em>Blighted</em>, a 3D Metroidvania that promises to take the concept of generational memory to some bizarre and compelling new places. It will have a solo or co-op story that sees players fighting their way through a world full of monsters and secrets as they attempt to control the blight that corrupts them. And maybe eat some brains. The game was announced during the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-summer-game-fests-kickoff-stream-here-at-5pm-et-193047477.html">Summer Game Fest kickoff stream</a>.</p>

<p>The team describes <em>Blighted</em> as a &quot;psychedelic western nightmare,&quot; which is pretty much exactly what I love to see from Drinkbox Studios. This company is probably best known for the excellent 2D platformers <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-guacamelee-review.html"><em>Guacamelee!</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-19-the-world-of-guacamelee-2.html"><em>Guacamelee! 2</em></a>, but don&#39;t sleep on the surreal dungeon-crawler <em>Severed</em> either. Drinkbox games have a powerful sense of place and clever action mechanics, so I&#39;m very curious to see how they&#39;ll bring those sensibilities into this genre.</p>
