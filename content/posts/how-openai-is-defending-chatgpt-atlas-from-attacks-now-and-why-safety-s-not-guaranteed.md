    An 'automated attacker' mimics the actions of human hackers to test the browser's defenses against prompt injection attacks. But there's a catch.

At the same time, the company acknowledges that the nature of this new type of browser likely means it will never be completely protected from certain kinds of attacks.The company published a blog post on Tuesday describing its latest effort to secure Atlas against prompt injection attacks, in which malicious third parties covertly slip instructions to the agent behind the browser, causing it to act against the user's interests; think of it like a digital virus that temporarily takes control of a host. Also: Use an AI browser? 5 ways to protect yourself from prompt injections - before it's too lateThe new approach utilizes AI to mimic the actions of human hackers. By automating the red teaming process, researchers can explore the security surface area much more quickly and thoroughly -- which is all the more important considering the speed at which agentic web browsers are being shipped to consumers.Critically, however, the blog post emphasizes that even with the most sophisticated security methods, agentic web browsers like Atlas are intrinsically vulnerable and will likely remain so. The best that the indus
