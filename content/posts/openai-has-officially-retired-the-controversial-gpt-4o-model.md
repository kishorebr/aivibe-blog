<p>OpenAI&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html">GPT-4o</a> may have survived its first brush with going offline, but it won&#39;t be as lucky this time. OpenAI has officially retired GPT-4o, the ChatGPT model that was seen as more conversational and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html">notoriously sycophantic</a>, on February 13. The news of GPT-4o&#39;s end was first announced in a post on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/">OpenAI website</a> in January, but the discontinuation also included GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini from ChatGPT.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time that OpenAI has delisted GPT-4o as an option for ChatGPT. In August, the AI giant sunsetted the GPT-4o model in favor of rolling out and prioritizing the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">GPT-5 model</a> at the time. However, a wave of user complaints led OpenAI to restore access to GPT-4o but with no guarantee that it&#39;ll be around forever.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This time around, OpenAI doesn&#39;t seem very open to preserving access to GPT-4o, especially since it&#39;ll serve only a small portion of the user base. The company wrote on its website that &quot;the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1 percent of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day.&quot; On top of that, OpenAI is facing several <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">wrongful death lawsuits</a> that specifically mention the GPT-4o model. Despite the two weeks of notice before GPT-4o&#39;s last day online, there is still a vocal group of users <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1r3unux/to_everyone_grieving_4o_today/">mourning</a> the loss of their <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.playboy.com/read/sex-relationships/the-women-mourning-the-deaths-of-their-ai-boyfriends">AI boyfriends</a> and even calling for OpenAI to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://x.com/search?q=%23keep4o&amp;src=typeahead_click">open-source</a> their preferred model.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-has-officially-retired-the-controversial-gpt-4o-model-181553067.html?src=rss
