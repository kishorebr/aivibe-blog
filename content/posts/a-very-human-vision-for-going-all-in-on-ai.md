<p class="has-text-align-none">It's easy to think about AI as a sort of existential battle between human and machine. Maybe it will be, someday, in a Skynet sort of way. But there are also lots of people trying to figure out how to use AI not as a replacement for human creativity and thinking but as a tool meant to augment those things.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sari Azout is one of those people. She's the founder of <a href="https://sublime.app/">Sublime</a>, a platform dedicated to curation, creativity, and ideas. Sublime is all about taste, which makes it slightly surprising that there's a huge amount of AI powering the way it works. But to Azout, it all makes sense.</p>
