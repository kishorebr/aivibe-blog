<p>YouTube introduced some new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/400586735?hl=en" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">filters</a> to its advanced search tools today. Possibly the most exciting change is that Shorts are now listed as a content type, so the three-minute-or-less videos can be excluded as results in your searches. </p><p>This is a welcome update for any of us who have been on the hunt for a long-form explainer only to wade through dozens of ten-second clips before finding anything close to our goal. Especially with the addition of even more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-is-adding-the-veo-3-video-generator-to-youtube-to-slopify-shorts-155339183.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">AI slop</a> last year thanks to the Google Veo 3 engine, an option to exclude Shorts may look even more appealing.</p><p>The other updates include a pair of renamed features within advanced search. The &quot;Sort By&quot; menu will now be called &quot;Prioritize.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;View Count&quot; option has been renamed to &quot;Popularity;&quot; this will allow YouTube&#39;s algorithms to account for other metrics such as watch time to gauge how much other users are engaging with a particular video. A pair of former filter options have also been removed; there will no longer be choices to search for &quot;Upload Date - Last Hour&quot; and &quot;Sort by Rating.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-will-let-you-exclude-shorts-from-search-results-204500097.html?src=rss
