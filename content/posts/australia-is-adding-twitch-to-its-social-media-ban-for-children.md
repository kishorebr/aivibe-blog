<p>The breadth and reach of Australia&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html"><ins>pioneering social media ban</ins></a> grows as livestream platform Twitch has now been added to the list of banned platforms for users under 16 years of age. The nationwide ban is the first of its kind and encompasses Facebook, X, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube and recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-be-included-in-australias-looming-under-16-social-media-ban-213052856.html"><ins>Reddit</ins></a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n2955g10o"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, Australia&#39;s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Twitch had been included because it was &quot;a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>No other platforms are expected to be added before the law goes into effect next month. Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest would not be included in the ban because the core purpose of the platform was not online social interaction.</p>
<p>Under the ban, platforms are expected to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to prevent underage users from accessing their platforms, and face steep fees for failure to comply. While <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html"><ins>VPNs</ins></a> may provide a workaround in some instances, the law still creates an enormous barrier to entry for users under 16.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/denmark-set-to-ban-social-media-for-users-under-15-years-of-age-171602408.html"><ins>Denmark announced</ins></a> its lawmakers had reached a bipartisan agreement to enact a similar ban for users under 15, though details were scarce. In the US, several states have attempted to enact such a ban including <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/texas-is-getting-ready-to-ban-social-media-for-anyone-under-18-180202219.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/floridas-social-media-law-has-been-temporarily-blocked-by-a-federal-judge-123004847.html"><ins>Florida</ins></a>, though these measures either failed to pass or are held up in court. Even laws that don&#39;t go as far, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/utah-judge-blocks-law-preventing-youth-from-accessing-social-media-freely-160008587.html"><ins>Utah&#39;s law</ins></a> requiring parents to grant permission for teens to open social media accounts, are facing stiff opposition on First Amendment grounds.</p>
