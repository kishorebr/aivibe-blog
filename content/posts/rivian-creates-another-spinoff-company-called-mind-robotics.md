Rivian has created its second spinoff company this year: an industrial AI and robotics venture called Mind Robotics.

The new effort will be focused around using “industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the company’s third-quarter shareholder letter published Tuesday.

Mind Robotics has already raised a $115 million seed round, which was led by VC firm Eclipse. Jiten Behl, a partner at Eclipse who also used to work at Rivian, revealed the investment in a LinkedIn post after TechCrunch previously reported the firm’s involvement in an earlier version of this story.

The launch of Mind Robotics marks the second time this year that Rivian has created a new stand-alone company. In March, the company spun out its skunkworks micromobility division into a startup called Also Inc. That new company was funded in part by money from Eclipse, with additional funding from Green
