<p>Spotify and Instagram are cozying up for more seamless music sharing. Two new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-08-21/spotify-takes-instagram-sharing-to-the-next-level-with-audio-previews-and-real-time-listening-notes/">features</a> make it easier for Spotify&#39;s nearly 700 million users to share their favorite tunes.</p>
<p>When sharing a Spotify track to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-stories-are-getting-comments-183051677.html">Instagram Stories</a>, a short snippet of the song will now be included. When people view the story, they&#39;ll have an option to open the track in Spotify. They can do that by tapping the music sticker on your post.</p>

<p>Along similar lines, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-makes-its-status-update-feature-more-interactive-160057778.html">Instagram Notes</a> now lets you show your friends what you&#39;re jamming out to. When creating a note, tap the music note symbol. Then, in the audio browser, choose &quot;Share from Spotify.&quot; The note will auto-update to show what you&#39;re listening to at that point. (Or, if you&#39;re not, it will display the next song you play within 30 minutes, so choose wisely.) Friends can tap your note to add the track to their Spotify likes.</p>
<p>Inversely, Instagram integration is easier in the Spotify app. When sharing a currently playing track from there, a new Notes icon will appear next to other Instagram sharing options.</p>
<p>The new features are available now (globally) on iOS and Android.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-adds-spotify-integration-to-stories-and-notes-195705816.html?src=rss
