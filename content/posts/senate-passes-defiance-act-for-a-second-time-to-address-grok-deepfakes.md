<p>The Senate has passed the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE ) Act with unanimous consent, according to the bill’s co-sponsor <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-successfully-passes-bill-to-combat-nonconsensual-sexually-explicit-deepfake-images" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)</a>. The bill lets the subjects of nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes take civil action against the people who create and host them.</p><p>Deepfakes are a known issue online,  but without the proper protections, easy access to AI-powered image and video generation tools has made it possible for anyone to create compromising content using another person&#39;s likeness. This has become <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a particular problem on X</a>, where the integration of Grok, the AI assistant created by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">X&#39;s parent company xAI</a>, makes it possible for anyone to turn the content of another person&#39;s post into an image-generating prompt. Over the last month, that&#39;s allowed users to create sexually explicit images of children, just by replying to a post with @grok and a request.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, Ofcom, the UK&#39;s media regulator, has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">opened an investigation into X</a> for potentially violating the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Online Safety Act</a>. The chatbot has also been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/grok-malaysia-indonesia-block-c7cb320327f259c4da35908e1269c225" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">outright blocked in Malaysia and Indonesia</a>. The DEFIANCE Act won&#39;t prevent Grok or other AI tools from generating nonconsensual deepfakes, but it would make creating or hosting that content potentially very expensive for anyone on the receiving end of a lawsuit.</p><p>The Senate passed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3696/text" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">an earlier version</a> of the DEFIANCE Act in 2024, but it stalled in the House. Given the urgency of Grok&#39;s deepfake problem, the hope is this <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1837/text" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">new version of the bill</a> won&#39;t see the same resistance. Congress passed an earlier piece of deepfake regulation last year, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-will-sign-the-take-it-down-act-criminalizing-ai-deepfakes-today-184358916.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Take It Down Act</a>, with bipartisan support. That bill was focused on the companies who host nonconsensual, sexually explicit content, rather than the people exploited by it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/senate-passes-defiance-act-for-a-second-time-to-address-grok-deepfakes-212151712.html?src=rss
