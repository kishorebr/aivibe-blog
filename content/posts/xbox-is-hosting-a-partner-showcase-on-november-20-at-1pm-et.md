<p>Xbox is hosting a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/">partner showcase event</a> on November 20 at 1PM ET. It&#39;ll be available for streaming on the platform&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox">official YouTube page</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch page</a>.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know how long this stream will run for, but previous Partner Preview events have <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-hosting-a-partner-showcase-on-october-17-at-1pm-et-174034491.html">lasted around 25 to 30 minutes</a>. As indicated by the name, this stream will highlight third-party publishers. Xbox called out companies like THQ Nordic, Tencent and IO Interactive in the press release that announced the event.</p>

<p>We do know some games that&#39;ll be getting the spotlight this week. Xbox has stated that we&#39;ll be seeing &quot;an exciting first look&quot; at content coming to the James Bond game, <em>007 First Light</em>. IO Interactive is behind that one and it <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-nintendo-switch-2-and-pc-on-march-27-191011686.html">comes out on March 27</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We got to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-hitman-meets-action-movie-183551755.html">watch this title in action</a> at Gamescom and called it &quot;Hitman meets action blockbuster.&quot; This is appropriate given that developer IO Interactive was behind many of the Hitman games.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll also be getting an &quot;electrifying extended gameplay trailer&quot; for <em>Tides of Annihilation</em>. This is an upcoming fantasy adventure game made by the Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games. The platform also promises a &quot;fresh look&quot; at <em>Reanimal</em>, which is a horror adventure from the folks behind <em>Little Nightmares</em>.</p>

<p>Xbox has also promised some &quot;brand-new reveals and Game Pass announcements.&quot; Those Game Pass announcements had better be beefy, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">considering that recent price hike</a>.
