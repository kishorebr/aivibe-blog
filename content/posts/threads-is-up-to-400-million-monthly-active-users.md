<p>Meta&#39;s X competitor, Threads, is continuing to add users at a brisk clip, with the social network now surpassing 400 million monthly active users. The news, reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91384230/meta-threads-just-achieved-its-biggest-milestone-yet"><em><ins>Fast Company</ins></em></a>, follows Threads reaching the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/metas-threads-has-grown-to-300-million-users-234138108.html"><ins>300 million</ins></a> mark in December 2024 and the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-has-200-million-users-211656147.html"><ins>200 million</ins></a> mark in August 2024.</p>
<p><em>FC</em> also cited data from Similarweb that showed mobile performance for Threads drawing closer to the figures from X. In June, Threads posted 115.1 million daily active users on mobile and X had 132 million. Those figures marked an increase of 128 percent on-year for Threads, but a slide of 15 percent from the previous year for X.</p>
