<p>SpaceX&#39;s massive Starship rocket is scheduled to lift off from the company&#39;s Texas launch site as soon as this evening for its 10th flight. The launch window opens at 7:30PM ET (6:30PM CT). As always, the flight test will be livestreamed on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10"><ins>SpaceX</ins></a> website and on X, with a webcast starting 30 minutes before launch. The weather is looking iffy for launch, though, so don&#39;t be surprised if this one gets postponed; SpaceX said on Saturday that conditions were looking only 45 percent favorable. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://space.com/"><em><ins>Space.com</ins></em></a>, the company has backup opportunities on August 25 and 26.</p>

<p>Flight 10 follows a series of failures this year during SpaceX&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html"><ins>seventh</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-again-during-its-eighth-test-flight-140018375.html"><ins>eighth</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-ninth-starship-test-flight-reaches-space-but-fails-to-deploy-fake-satellites-120057474.html"><ins>ninth</ins></a> test flights. And in June, a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-on-the-ground-during-a-routine-test-130025133.html">Starship vehicle exploded</a> on the ground during preparations for a static fire test of its six Raptor engines. If all goes according to plan for Flight 10, Starship will deploy eight dummy Starlink satellites and perform &quot;several experiments focused on enabling Starship’s upper stage to return to the launch site.&quot; It won&#39;t actually be returning to the launch site this time, though. The test is expected to last a little over an hour, and end with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</p>
