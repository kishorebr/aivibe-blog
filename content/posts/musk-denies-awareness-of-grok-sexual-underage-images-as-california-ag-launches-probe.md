The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking i
