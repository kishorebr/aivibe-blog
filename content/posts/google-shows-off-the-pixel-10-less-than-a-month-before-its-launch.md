<p>As is tradition, Google has already shown off at least one of its new Pixel phones before it&#39;s announced. The front page of the Google Store currently features a short video <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_10?hl=en-US&amp;CJPID=8836598&amp;CJAID=14460385&amp;dclid=CIyR4OPUzo4DFSfTKQMdOmM87g&amp;pli=1">teasing one of the Pixel 10</a> smartphones the company is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-next-made-by-google-event-better-known-as-the-pixel-launch-is-set-for-august-20-162832319.html">announcing on August 20</a>.</p>
<p>If you take the webpage literally, then Google&#39;s video is showing off the base Pixel 10, which has a similar look to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9-review-the-go-to-android-smartphone-133005548.html">Pixel 9</a>, with some key differences. Those include a new grayish-blue finish, a tweaked back design that makes the back of the phone looks like it&#39;s rising out of the frame and an additional camera. If you haven&#39;t gotten to try a Pixel 9, last year&#39;s phone only had wide and ultrawide cameras, with the telephoto lens exclusive to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-review-superb-cameras-with-a-side-of-gemini-ai-170055834.html">Pixel 9 Pro</a> models. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10-camera-details-3540182/">Leaks suggest</a> Google is giving all of its phones telephoto cameras in 2025, though it&#39;s still possible the phone in the video is a Pixel 10 Pro.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s not much to glean from the video beyond that. Some of that could be because of the more <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-3470386/">modest approach</a> Google is rumored to be taking with its new phones, focusing on technical improvements — like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tensor-g5-specs-3493019/">a new Tensor chip</a> — rather than radical new designs.</p>
<p>Google runs a leaky ship when it comes to hardware, with most of its new products reported on well in advance of the company actually announcing them. In recent years, Google has seemingly embraced that, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-just-confirmed-the-pixel-9-pros-outrageous-camera-bump-185301609.html">teasing the Pixel 9 lineup ahead</a> of launch last year, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-just-teased-the-pixel-7-at-io-2022-184400206.html">revealing the Pixel 7</a> months before it was announced in October 2022.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-shows-off-the-pixel-10-less-than-a-month-before-its-launch-203924194.html?src=rss
