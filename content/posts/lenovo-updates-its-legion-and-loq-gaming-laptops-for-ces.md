<p>Lenovo has brought a slew of updates to its Legion and LOQ line of gaming laptops for CES 2026. The refreshed laptops are all built around Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Legion 7a is both thinner and lighter than the previous generation and is aimed at gamers, creators, and working professionals. Lenovo says the new 7a will be powered by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html"><ins>AMD Ryzen AI 400 CPUs</ins></a> and RTX 50-series GPUs, delivering up to 125W of total system power.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Presumably this means buyers will choose from multiple CPU and GPU configurations, and Lenovo says the 7a will support up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 and up to an RTX 5060 GPU, but precise details on other configurations have not been made available.</p>
<p>The laptop sports a 16-inch OLED display and Lenovo says the laptop&#39;s &quot;AI-optimized&quot; performance is ready to handle complex coding, simulation, and 3D modeling projects. The 7a runs on Windows 11 Copilot+ and uses on-board software to dynamically tune power use and thermals depending on the workload the laptop is under. The Legion 7a will start at $2,000, with availability &quot;expected&quot; in April.</p>
<p>Lenovo is also refreshing the Legion 5 line with the Legion 5i powered by the new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html"><ins>Intel Core Ultra Series 3</ins></a> and Legion 5a with a choice of an AMD Ryzen AI 400 or Ryzen 200. Both will offer RTX 50-series GPUs, OLED displays and the same software-based tuning features as the 7a. Lenovo says the 5i can be figured up to an Intel Ultra 9 386H with an RTX 5060 GPU, and the 5a up to a Ryzen AI 9 465 with RTX 5060. Here again we don&#39;t yet have details on alternate configurations.</p>
<p>The Legion 5 laptops run on Windows 11 Copilot+, and Lenovo says they are ready for gaming, streaming, building presentations and video editing. Pricing starts at $1,550 for the 5i, $1,500 for the 5a with Ryzen AI 400 and $1,300 for the 5a with Ryzen 200. Lenovo also expects these laptops to be available in April.</p>
<p>At the entry level, the LOQ 15AHP11 and LOQ 15IPH11 target students with RTX 50-series graphics and a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) LCD display up to 15.3 inches. The 15AHP11 will start from $1,150 with availability expected in April, while the 15IPH11 will not be sold in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-updates-its-legion-and-loq-gaming-laptops-for-ces-010042509.html?src=rss
