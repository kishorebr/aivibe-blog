<p>We&#39;ve been covering all the news Apple announced at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-ios-26-new-liquid-glass-design-and-everything-else-apple-announced-171718769.html">WWDC 2025</a>, but possibly the most exciting element coming to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-new-ios-26-features-and-its-liquid-glass-redesign-at-wwdc-2025-171650243.html">iOS 26</a> wasn&#39;t discussed on stage. The next update to the operating system will let people set custom snooze times. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/11/ios-26-big-change-iphone-alarm-options/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> reported that iOS 26 will offer anywhere from one to 15 minute snoozes that users can select when setting the alarm.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has kept the snooze timing locked at nine minutes. If you wanted to doze at a different interval, you&#39;d need to set separate alarms or use a different app than the iPhone&#39;s built-in Clock. It was an odd choice for Apple to not allow personal preferences on this aspect of its smartphones, so anyone who&#39;s been frustrated by the nine-minute restriction will have a little extra treat to look forward to in the mornings when iOS 26 becomes <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html">publicly available</a> this fall.
