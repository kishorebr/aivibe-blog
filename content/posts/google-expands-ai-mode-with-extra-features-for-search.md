<p>Google is continuing to double down on its AI Mode, bringing more features to its dedicated Search chatbot. Today, the company is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/deep-search-business-calling-google-search/"><ins>adding</ins></a> the Gemini 2.5 Pro model and the Deep Search capability to AI Mode. These features will be available to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. Although both of these tools can still be accessed through other means, Google's move to incorporate them into the chatbot points to an end goal of AI Mode being the primary form of engagement with the company's signature search service.</p>
<p>These developments are follow-ups to announcements made during Google's I/O conference this spring. AI Mode began <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html"><ins>rolling out</ins></a> to all Google users in May, and Deep Think was also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-introduces-the-deep-think-reasoning-model-for-gemini-25-pro-and-a-better-25-flash-174531020.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> as an option for the Gemini 2.5 Pro model at that time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another AI tool teased at I/O was the ability for Gemini to place phone calls with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/project-astra-googles-vision-for-a-universal-ai-assistant-is-pulling-into-focus-174539875.html"><ins>Project Astra</ins></a>. This agentic option is also coming in a limited form to AI Mode. For starters, it will only be able to contact local businesses and its topics will be limited to inquiring about availability and pricing. When a person searches for companies or services, they may see an option such as "Have AI check prices" that will initiate a call to that business. These AI phone calls are rolling out today to all Search users, but Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will have higher limits.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-expands-ai-mode-with-extra-features-for-search-205252812.html?src=rss
