<p>Reddit is making it easier to gauge the impact your comments are having. The company is introducing detailed analytics for comments that measure views and other engagement metrics. Reddit shared the change as part of a larger batch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/1l9q6d1/your_comments_upgraded_share_more_track_stats/"><ins>of updates</ins></a> around how it handles comments on its platform.</p>
<p>Comment insights will provide details around upvotes (including the ratio of upvotes to downvotes), replies, views, shares and awards. Additionally, Redditors will now be able to share comments as a standalone post on Reddit.</p>

<p>The platform is also adding a drafts feature for comments that will allow people to save up to 20 drafts for 14 days. Drafts will automatically save, according to Reddit, so that you can revisit your thoughts if you navigate away from the page or leave the app mid-comment. In an update <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1l9q4cc/new_ways_to_share_comments_get_insights_and_save/"><ins>to moderators</ins></a>, Reddit said that drafts is &quot;still in its early iteration&quot; and that it may tweak how the feature works in future versions.</p>
<p>The changes are the latest way Reddit has added more flexibility around comments in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the company said it would allow users <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-will-let-you-hide-posts-comments-and-nsfw-activity-from-your-public-profile-191956773.html"><ins>to hide</ins></a> their commenting history from their profiles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-adds-analytics-and-drafts-for-comments-060550128.html?src=rss
