<p>Nintendo Switch 2 owners can forget about seeing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> in the Nintendo Store, at least as of now. In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA</a>, Larian Studio&#39;s CEO, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6">Swen Vicke</a>, said that the team would have loved to bring the title to Switch 2, but &quot;it wasn&#39;t our decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>As cryptic as that may sound, Vicke&#39;s response hints that either Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons and Dragons IP that <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em> is set in, or Nintendo is behind the lack of a port. When it comes to Wizards of the Coast, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501?s=20">rumors</a> have circulated that the game studio and Wizards of the Coast may have a strained relationship. On the other hand, Larian Studios&#39; technical director, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz">Bert van Semmertier</a>, revealed in a response to another AMA question that the studio just released <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> on the Switch 2, adding that &quot;we love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next Divinity game.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s still a chance that Wizards of the Coast decides to hire another studio to pursue a port in the future, but there&#39;s been no indication yet. As for why <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-confirms-it-wont-make-the-sequel-091930642.html">Larian Studios</a> won&#39;t be behind a potential Switch 2 port, the developer said in a statement last year that it would no longer develop any major content updates or expansions for <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em>, nor work on a sequel.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/dont-count-on-baldurs-gate-3-coming-to-switch-2-as-least-for-now-180538969.html?src=rss
