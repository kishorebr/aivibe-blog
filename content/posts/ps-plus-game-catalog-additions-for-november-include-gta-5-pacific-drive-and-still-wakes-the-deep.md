<p>Sony has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-and-more/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">revealed</a> the list of November additions to its PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for those on the Extra and Premium tiers of the subscription service. It’s a pretty darn good slate of games this time around, headlined by the return of the PS4 and PS5 versions of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> to the service. </p><p>It’s at least the third time <em>GTA V </em>has been part of the Game Catalog — it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-november-include-gta-v-again-and-dying-light-2-174646227.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in the lineup twice last year</a>. Developer Rockstar Games, which is currently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/union-files-legal-claims-against-rockstar-games-following-alleged-union-busting-165033747.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">facing accusations of union busting,</a> is set to release <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in November 2026</a>. If you have yet to play <em>GTA V </em>or haven’t dipped in since the PS3/Xbox 360 era, this could be a decent way for you to pass some time until the next entry arrives.</p><p><em>Pacific Drive </em>(PS5) joined the Game Pass library when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/superhero-workplace-comedy-more-powerwashing-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-230000337.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">hit Xbox last month</a> and it’s headed to Sony’s subscription service as well. This is a nifty looking run-based survival game that sees you driving around a post-apocalyptic version of the Pacific Northwest in search of parts to upgrade your station wagon. </p><p><em>Still Wakes the Deep </em>(PS5), a narrative horror game from <em>Dear Esther </em>studio The Chinese Room, is also coming to the PS Plus catalog this month. It pits you against terrifying creatures while you’re trapped on an oil rig in the North Sea. Engadget senior editor Jessica Conditt called this one <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/still-wakes-the-deep-is-a-modern-horror-classic-175304800.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a “modern horror classic.”</a></p><p>The tremendously silly and rude <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/thank-goodness-youre-here-is-a-vibrant-funny-unashamedly-silly-game-133030648.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></a>, tactical multiplayer shooter <em>Insurgency: Sandstorm </em>and racing games <em>Monster Jam Showdown </em>and <em>MotoGP 25 </em>will be available to PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers on both PS4 and PS5 later this month. First-person puzzle game <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-talos-principle-2-is-the-ideal-blend-of-puzzle-and-story-150009663.html" data-i13n="slk:The Talos Principle II;cpos:8;pos:1"><em>The Talos Principle II</em></a><em> </em>will only be on PS5. </p><p>PS Plus Premium members get one extra game this month. An emulated version of PS2 game <em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary </em>will be playable on PS4 and PS5 for the first time.</p><p>All of these will join the PS Plus Game Catalog on November 18. In the meantime, all PS Plus members can claim the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">monthly games for November</a>, which are <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24 </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</em>. You have until December 1 to add those to your <s>backlog</s> library.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-november-include-gta-5-pacific-drive-and-still-wakes-the-deep-194029093.html?src=rss
