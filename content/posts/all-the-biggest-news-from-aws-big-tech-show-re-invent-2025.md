Amazon Web Services’ annual tech conference AWS re:Invent has wrapped up its first official day of programming and has already delivered an endless stream of product news. 

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise, although this year it’s all about upgrades that give its customers greater control to customize AI agents — including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days.


	
	




	
	



AWS re:Invent 2025, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.

“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”

While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the announcements that got our attention. TechCrunch will continue to update this article through the end of AWS re:Invent, so be sure to check back.

An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility

AWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.

AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.
