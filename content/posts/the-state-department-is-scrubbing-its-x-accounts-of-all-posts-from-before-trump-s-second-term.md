<p>The State Department is wiping the post history of its X accounts and making it so you&#39;ll have to file a Freedom of Information Act request if you want to access any of the content it removed, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/07/nx-s1-5704785/state-department-trump-posts-x" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>NPR</em></a>. The publication reports that the State Department is removing all posts from before President Trump&#39;s current term — a move that affects several accounts associated with the department, including those for US embassies, and posts from the Biden and Obama administrations. Posts from Trump&#39;s first term will be taken down too.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike how past administrations have handled the removal of social media content and the transition of accounts, these posts won&#39;t be kept in a public archive. A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed this to <em>NPR,</em> and said the move is meant &quot;to limit confusion on U.S government policy and to speak with one voice to advance the President, Secretary, and Administration&#39;s goals and messaging. It will preserve history while promoting the present.&quot; The spokesperson also called the X accounts &quot;one of our most powerful tools for advancing the America First goals.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-ftc-has-removed-all-business-blog-posts-from-the-biden-administration-214734633.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Trump administration</a> has been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/court-orders-the-cdc-and-fda-to-restore-deleted-web-pages-related-to-gender-identity-133008251.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">purging information</a> from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/the-usda-will-republish-climate-change-information-online-following-farmer-lawsuit-211907357.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">government websites</a> since he took office last year.
