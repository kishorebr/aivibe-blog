<p>AI is an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/global-emissions-due-to-ai-related-chipmaking-grew-more-than-four-times-in-2024-160304017.html">enormous energy drain</a>, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the planet desperately needs progress in the opposite direction. Although most of that comes from running GPUs, cooling them is another significant overhead. So, it&#39;s worth noting when a company of Microsoft&#39;s stature <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/">claims</a> to have achieved a breakthrough in chip cooling.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s new system is based on microfluidics, a method <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-24-maze-like-chip-helps-spot-aggressive-cancer-cells.html">long pursued</a> but hard to implement. The company claims its approach could lead to three times better cooling than current methods.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many data centers rely on cold plates to prevent GPUs from overheating. Although effective to a degree, the plates are separated from the heat source by several layers of material, which limits their performance. &quot;If you&#39;re still relying heavily on traditional cold plate technology [in five years], you&#39;re stuck,&quot; Microsoft program manager Sashi Majety is quoted as saying in the company&#39;s announcement.</p>
<p>In microfluidics, the coolant flows closer to the source. The liquid in Microsoft&#39;s prototype moves through thread-like channels etched onto the back of the chip. The company also used AI to more efficiently direct the coolant through those channels.</p>

<p>Another aspect separating this prototype from previous attempts is that it drew inspiration from Mother Nature. As you can see in the image above, the etchings resemble the veins in a leaf or a butterfly wing.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the technique can reduce the maximum silicon temperature rise inside a GPU by 65 percent. (However, that number depends on the workload and chip type.) This would enable overclocking &quot;without worrying about melting the chip down,&quot; Microsoft&#39;s Jim Kleewein said. It could allow the company to place servers closer together physically, reducing latency. It would also lead to &quot;higher-quality&quot; waste heat use.</p>
<p>Although this sounds good for the environment in a general sense, Microsoft&#39;s announcement doesn&#39;t lean into that. The blog post primarily discusses the technique&#39;s potential for performance and efficiency gains. Green benefits are only alluded to briefly as &quot;sustainability&quot; and reduced grid stress. Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s only a case of a cynical observer overanalyzing framing. Our planet needs <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-report-says-the-world-is-on-a-disastrous-trajectory-due-to-climate-change-132508138.html">all the help it can get</a>.</p>
