<p>Productivity setups are a personal thing. Some people swear by to-do lists and apps, some people like scheduling and planners. For those in the latter camp, Google has made a minor but valuable <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/11/block-time-for-tasks-google-calendar.html">addition</a> to the Workspace suite. Going forward, you&#39;ll be able to block off segments of time in Google Calendar for working on specific tasks. You can add descriptions and set your preferences for that task in regard to do not disturb and visibility settings. It&#39;s a nice step up from scheduling meetings with yourself when you have to focus on a particular assignment (which several of us at <em>Engadget</em> have been known to do).</p>

<p>This option began appearing for Google&#39;s Rapid Release domains earlier in November, while standard release domains will see a gradual release beginning December 1. Once it’s fully rolled out, it will be available by default, whether you&#39;re a Google Workspaces customer or just using a personal Google account.</p>
