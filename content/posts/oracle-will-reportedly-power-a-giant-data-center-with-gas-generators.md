<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/oracle-cloud-powers-openai-nvidia-and-larry-ellison-s-riches"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> has published a deep dive into operations at Oracle, chronicling the software giant&#39;s rise in cloud computing and current push into powering artificial intelligence projects. The publication reported that Oracle has promised to develop tens of billions of dollars in data centers, which have become a hot business. Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-partners-with-oracle-to-built-out-45-gigawatts-in-data-center-capacity-143423570.html"><ins>4.5 gigawatts of computing power</ins></a>. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, that&#39;s enough energy to power &quot;millions of American homes.&quot;</p>
<p>So far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be. For instance, a source said the company plans to spend more than $1 billion a year powering a single data center in Texas with gas generators rather than waiting for a utility connection to be built. When completed, this data center is expected to be one of the largest known sites, with computing power of 1.4 gigawatts.</p>

<p>Purely on the financial side, Oracle&#39;s decision to invest so much so quickly meant the company reported its first negative annual cash flow since 1990. Should the current rates of AI investment turn out to be a bubble, it could be very bad news to have many billions of dollars on the line.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/oracle-will-reportedly-power-a-giant-data-center-with-gas-generators-211658314.html?src=rss
