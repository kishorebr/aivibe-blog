Common Sense Media, a kids-safety-focused nonprofit offering ratings and reviews of media and technology, released its risk assessment of Google’s Gemini AI products on Friday.

The latter could be of particular concern to parents, as AI has reportedly played a role in some teen suicides in recent months. OpenAI is facing its first wrongful death lawsuit after a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly consulting with ChatGPT for months about his plans, having successfully bypassed the chatbot’s safety guardrails. Previously, the AI companion maker Character.AI was also sued over a teen user’s suicide.

In addition, the analysis comes as news leaks indicate that Apple is considering Gemini as the LLM (large language model) that will help to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri, due out next year. This could expose more teens to risks, unless Apple mitigates the safety concerns somehow. 

Common Sense also said that Gemini’s products for kids and teens ignored how younger users needed different guidance and information than older ones. As a result, both were labeled as “High R
