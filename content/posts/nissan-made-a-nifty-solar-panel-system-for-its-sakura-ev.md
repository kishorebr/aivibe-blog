<p>As we&#39;ve seen with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-2023-prius-prime-plug-in-hybrid-162057073.html">Toyota&#39;s Prius Prime</a>, putting a solar panel on a car&#39;s roof is a nifty idea but can only gain you a few free miles a day due to the limited size. With a new prototype of its hyper-popular Sakura &quot;kei&quot; EV, Nissan has the answer: a bigger solar panel roof called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-4490cf5fc2161a51d431ba720301391e">AO-Solar Extender</a>. When fully stretched out on a sunny day, it can add about 1,864 miles of driving distance a year and power multiple accessories.</p>
<p>The panel works whether you&#39;re driving or parked. When extended (in &quot;solar pompadour&quot; mode as my colleague put it), it generates 500 watts on sunny days. At the same time, it helps block sunlight from the windshield, &quot;reducing cabin temperature and lowering the need for air conditioning power consumption,&quot; Nissan noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When retracted in driving mode, it still pumps out 300 watts in the sun (80 watts in the rain), quite a bit more than the 185 watts max generated by the Prius Prime&#39;s solar roof. And if you&#39;re worried about aerodynamics, Nissan said the roof is designed to minimize drag and integrate well with the Sakura&#39;s design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just a fun exercise, as Nissan said it&#39;s planning to launch the AO-Solar Extender commercially, with details to follow at a later date. It could be a useful accessory on the Sakura, which has been Japan&#39;s most popular EV since 2022 thanks to its &quot;sufficient&quot; range, cute kei looks and spacious interior. The automaker will show it off at the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.japan-mobility-show.com/en/">Japan Mobility Show</a> starting on October 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nissan-made-a-nifty-solar-panel-system-for-its-sakura-ev-061235566.html?src=rss
