<p>Major League Baseball has entered a new broadcasting <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-announces-media-rights-deals-with-espn-nbc-netflix" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">deal</a> that will see Netflix hosting live games for the first time. Under this three-year agreement, Netflix will have the rights to air a new Opening Night game the evening ahead of the Opening Day matchups. It will also stream the T-Mobile Home Run Derby as well as select special events during the season, including the 2026 MLB at Field of Dreams Game and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/world-baseball-classic-inc-and-netflix-exclusive-partnership" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">previously announced</a> World Baseball Classic in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a limited amount of content, but aligns with Netflix&#39;s recent pushes into both live events and sports programming. Last year the streaming service inked deals to show a double-header of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">NFL games</a> on Christmas Day and snagged exclusive US rights to two <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-scores-the-broadcasting-rights-to-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-174017963.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup tournaments</a>. Netflix has previously gotten access to documentary content from the MLB, but 2026 will mark its first time showing live baseball.&nbsp;</p><p>The MLB deal also included some shuffling on the broadcast side, moving certain matches between ESPN and NBCUniversal properties. Apple TV will still have the rights to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apples-friday-night-baseball-is-back-on-march-28-with-a-world-series-documentary-in-tow-222335747.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Friday night games</a> going forward. So between the growing number of platforms grabbing slices of viewership and the MLB&#39;s existing blackout rules, in future seasons you&#39;ll need to undertake a thorough research assignment to figure out where you can watch each game. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-lands-a-deal-with-mlb-to-air-select-live-baseball-games-213336003.html?src=rss
