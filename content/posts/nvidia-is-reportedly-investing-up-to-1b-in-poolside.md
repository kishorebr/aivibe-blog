Nvidia is reportedly investing up to $1B in Poolside 


Semiconductor giant Nvidia is looking to invest at least $500 million, and up to $1 billion, in Poolside, which builds AI models for software development, according to reporting from Bloomberg, which cited sources. This investment would be part of a $2 billion funding round Poolside is raising at a $12 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.

Nvidia’s investment could rise to $1 billion if the company successfully completes the rest of the funding round, Bloomberg reported.


	
	




	
	



This wouldn’t be Nvidia’s first investment in Poolside. The company previously backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024.

Nvidia, already a prolific investor in AI startups, has been broadening its portfolio to include diverse sectors. For example, Nvidia said it was exploring a $500 million investment into U.K.-based self-driving company Wayve in October. Last month, the company took a $5 billion stake in Intel with plans for future chip collaboration.

TechCrunch reached out to Poolside for more information.
