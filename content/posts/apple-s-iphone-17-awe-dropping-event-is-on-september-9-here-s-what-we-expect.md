<p>We&#39;re now less than two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed &quot;Awe dropping&quot; this year, the event — confirmed after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-host-its-iphone-17-event-on-september-9-160502418.html">Apple sent &quot;save the date&quot; invitations</a> to the media on August 26 — will be <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU">livestreamed on YouTube</a> September 9 at 1PM ET from Cupertino. And Engadget staff will be there, reporting and liveblogging from Apple Park to give their hands-on impressions. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent September product rollouts, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company&#39;s lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.</p>
<p>We got a full rundown of what to expect at the event from the best possible source: <em>Bloomberg</em> Apple reporter extraordinaire Mark Gurman. During his recent guest appearance on the Engadget Podcast, Gurman shared his analysis of what we expect to see, including the expected battery and camera compromises of that rumored thin iPhone (which everyone already calls the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-considered-making-the-rumored-iphone-17-air-completely-port-free-according-to-report-165334942.html">iPhone Air</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Expected to be roughly <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">5.55 mm thick</a>, the iPhone Air would be the thinnest iPhone yet, besting <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-16-iphone-6-and-6-plus-review.html">2014&#39;s iPhone 6</a> which, at 6.9 mm, was the previous svelteness champ. And they&#39;ve only gotten chunkier since then. (The <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html">iPhone 16 Pro</a> has a depth of 8.25 mm.) The Air would also give Apple a direct rival to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html">Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which we found to be more than a gimmick.</p>

<p>But the iPhone Air&#39;s thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC2h25%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-17%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88%E8%88%87%E8%B6%85%E8%96%84iphone-17%E7%9A%84%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC%E8%88%87%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90-predictions-and-analysis-of-the-2h25-new-iphone-17-1528d0772610">rumored</a> to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won&#39;t be for everyone.</p>
<p>The Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire &quot;island&quot; that extends across most of the phone&#39;s backside. It&#39;s expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/iphone-17-pro-anti-reflective-display/">add</a> an anti-glare coating, similar to those <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-12-apple-ipad-anti-glare-display.html">found on iPads</a>.</p>
<p>The standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/20/all-iphone-17-models-could-get-big-display-upgrades-heres-what-to-expect/">claimed</a> it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678-143041273.html">since 2021</a>.</p>

<p>One thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-upcoming-iphone-and-ipad-updates-135749976.html">iOS 26</a>, which brings Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">biggest design refresh in years</a>. It&#39;s easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model&#39;s displays as the best way to experience the new <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">Liquid Glass</a> visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven&#39;t been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (&quot;iPhone 26,&quot; &quot;iPhone 26 Pro,&quot; etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.</p>

<p>Apple&#39;s fall event isn&#39;t just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn&#39;t launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html">a new color</a>), so it&#39;s due for an upgrade.</p>
<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we&#39;ll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.</p>
<p>We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It&#39;s been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-next-airpods-pro-could-offer-heart-rate-and-temperature-monitoring-175757188.html">biometric sensors to the earphones</a>: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html">Live translation is also rumored</a>, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model. But don&#39;t expect major design changes, if the latest reports from leaker <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://majinbuofficial.com/airpods-pro-3-new-design-unveiled/">Majin Bu</a> (via <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/28/airpods-pro-3-smaller-case-and-capacitive-button/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>) are to be believed: In addition to a &quot;slight reduction in size,&quot; Bu notes the case will lose the physical pairing button, while gaining capacitive controls.</p>
<p>Will there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won&#39;t have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.</p>
