<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-can-automatically-let-a-trusted-friend-know-you-got-home-safe-130010806.html">Snapchat</a> has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infiniteretentionandgroupstreaks">introduced</a> a couple of new features it says are &quot;highly requested&quot; by its users. The first is &quot;Infinite Retention,&quot; which as its name implies will allow you to keep a chat history like you could on a messaging app and prevent your messages from disappearing. &quot;We’ve often heard from our community that Snapchatters want to save their chats forever and wish they could build streaks with their favorite groups,&quot; its announcement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app has been testing the feature <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infinite-retention-mode">since 2024</a>, and now it&#39;s being rolled out broadly. You could already save messages in the app by tapping on them inside the chat, but this one makes things easier. It&#39;s a setting you&#39;ll just have to switch on or off for each conversation. If you enable the setting, the other person in the conversation will get a notification that you did, and they will be able to switch it off if they want. You can, for instance, switch Infinite Retention on for a close friend but keep it off for acquaintances.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Snapchat is rolling out Group Streaks that will let you contribute to a collective Streak with your friends. To keep up individual Streaks, you&#39;ll have to send and receive at least one photo or video Snap with a friend every day. Group Streaks are easier to keep going, since several people can participate. You can also restore a Group Streak within a week in case it ends.&nbsp;</p>
