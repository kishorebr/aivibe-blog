<p>A new co-op adventure is coming from Epic Games. Made by WiredFly and Kong Orange,<em> Out of Words </em>will offer a stop-motion-flavored platform adventure that&#39;s a little bit cozy and a little bit fantasy. The controllable humans have had their mouths stolen — that&#39;s why it&#39;s called <em>Out of Word</em>s. (It&#39;s a little On The Nose.)</p>
<p>The cute figures and creatures have been crafted by hand, and cutscenes suggest they&#39;ve been stop-motion animated alongside the gaming parts. Alongside the two humans you seemingly control, there&#39;s also a cute flying stingray. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/out-of-words#:~:text=Find%20your%20lost%20voices%20in,see%20is%20crafted%20by%20hand.">According to Epic Games,</a> much of that whimsy originates from the mind of acclaimed poet Morten Søndergaard.</p>

<p>A core navigation dynamic will be the ability to invert gravity, allowing players to run upside-down alongside each other. There are other traversal powers, including monstrous arms that can grab and slingshot players across spaces.</p>
<p><em>Out of Words</em> launches in 2026, and is coming to the Epic Games Store, PS5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/out-of-words-is-a-cozy-stop-motion-co-op-adventure-from-epic-games-220803056.html?src=rss
