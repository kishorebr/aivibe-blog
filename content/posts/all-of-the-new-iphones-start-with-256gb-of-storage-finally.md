<p>There&#39;s a lot to like about the new iPhone lineup: new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17s-new-selfie-camera-lets-you-take-group-shots-without-rotating-your-phone-195345475.htm"><ins>selfie cameras</ins></a>, a new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html"><ins>unibody frame</ins></a> and a even a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html"><ins>super-thin</ins></a> iPhone, if that&#39;s your thing. All of the new phones share one important upgrade you might have missed during Apple&#39;s 72-minute livestream, though: they all start at 256GB of storage.</p>
<p>For the first time in four years, Apple raised the base-level storage on its entire iPhone lineup. Since the iPhone 13, Apple&#39;s phones have started at 128GB for the cheapest configuration. Now, the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and iPhone Air will start with double that capacity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s about time.</p>
<p>While 128GB may sound like a decent amount of storage, it hasn&#39;t made sense as a base amount of storage for some time, particularly for Pro-level phones, which have much more powerful cameras. Apple has seemingly understood this for a while: for the last two years (when the iPhone 15 lineup launched), the Pro Max versions have started at 256GB. But there&#39;s absolutely no reason that only people buying the most expensive iPhone should get a storage bump.</p>
<p>Because I write about tech, my friends and family often ask me for help &quot;fixing&quot; various problems with their phones. (I spend most of my time reporting on the social media industry, so usually this involves me just Googling their specific issue and muddling through.) I&#39;ve lost track of the times friends have asked me for help fixing things that boil down to the fact that they simply don&#39;t have enough storage left on their phone. And, almost every time, they only have the minimum 128GB of storage that&#39;s come standard since the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 13 line.</p>
<p>But no one wants to hear: &quot;you don&#39;t have enough storage, you need to delete stuff.&quot; One of my friends recently vowed to never buy the cheapest iPhone again, after I explained that paying for extra iCloud wouldn&#39;t address her issues around local storage.</p>
<p>But if you can afford it, paying for a storage upgrade is still worth it. Yes, paying the $200 extra for 512GB for $400 more for 1TB on the Pro series (which now maxes out at $1999 for 2TB) stings. It makes an already-expensive phone feel like an even bigger investment. But as someone who shelled out for a 512GB iPhone 14 Pro three years ago, I have no regrets about paying that extra premium.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using about 295GB of my allotted storage and have never once had to think about whether I need to clear out my downloaded media or if I have enough storage to shoot photos of my nephew in ProRAW Max or record cinematic videos on vacation. I plan on keeping this phone at least another year and I expect I&#39;ll still have plenty of storage left by the time I do decide to upgrade (extra storage also helps a bit with resale or trade-in value).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, if you just can&#39;t bring yourself to pay extra for more capacity — and I get it, I really do — jumping from 128GB to 256GB will still be a meaningful bump. You might not notice it right away, but it should give most people a lot of extra time before they start seeing those dreaded &quot;storage almost full&quot; pop-ups.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/all-of-the-new-iphones-start-with-256gb-of-storage-finally-222415353.html?src=rss
