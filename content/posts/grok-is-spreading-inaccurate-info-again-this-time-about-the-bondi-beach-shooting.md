<p>In the same month that Grok opted for a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-would-prefer-a-second-holocaust-over-harming-elon-musk-200023093.html">second Holocaust</a> over vaporizing Elon Musk&#39;s brain, the AI chatbot is on the fritz again. Following the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia during a festival to mark the start of Hanukkah, Grok is responding to user requests with inaccurate or completely unrelated info, as first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gizmodo.com/grok-is-glitching-and-spewing-misinformation-about-the-bondi-beach-shooting-2000699533"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>.</p>
<p>Grok&#39;s confusion seems to be most apparent with a viral video that shows a 43-year-old bystander, identified as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3wkey5p33o">Ahmed al Ahmed</a>, wrestling a gun away from an attacker during the incident, which has left at least 16 dead, according to the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-shooting-sydney-bondi-beach-31f711f09f677d0f88091ece25f651c1">news</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgk391yzm7t">reports</a>. Grok&#39;s responses show it repeatedly <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/grok/status/2000282306980802587">misidentifying</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/grok/status/2000259322782101584">the individual</a> who stopped one of the gunmen.
