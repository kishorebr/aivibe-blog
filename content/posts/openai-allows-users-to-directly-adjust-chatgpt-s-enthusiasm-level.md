OpenAI allows users to directly adjust ChatGPT’s enthusiasm level


ChatGPT users can now tweak the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use, according to a social media post from OpenAI.

These options (as well as similar adjustments to ChatGPT’s use of headers and lists) now appear in the Personalization menu and can be set to More, Less, or Default. They allow users to further customize ChatGPT’s tone, on top of the existing ability to set a “base style and tone” — including the Professional, Candid, and Quirky tones that OpenAI added in November.


	
	




	
	



ChatGPT’s tone has been an ongoing issue this year, with OpenAI rolling back one update for being “too sycophant-y,” then later adjusting GPT-5 to be “warmer and friendlier” after some users complained that the new model was colder and less friendly.

Some academics and AI critics have suggested that chatbots’ tendency to praise users and affirm their beliefs are a “dark pattern” that creates addictive behavior and can have a negative effect on users’ mental health.
