<p>Microsoft issued another out-of-band update to fix a bug that caused <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-outlook-free-to-use-for-mac-201328421.html">Outlook</a> to crash for Windows 11 users. This second <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-25h2#2738msgdesc">emergency patch</a> addresses issues seen with Outlook and files stored in the cloud following Microsoft&#39;s January 2026 Windows security update.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, this update fixes a bug where some apps that &quot;open or save files stored in cloud-backed locations&quot; became unresponsive or displayed error messages. Some users also experienced Outlook crashing or not opening when PST files are stored in cloud-based options like OneDrive.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is the second time this year that Microsoft had to issue a last-minute fix for bugs related to its January security update. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-issues-emergency-fix-afer-a-security-update-left-some-windows-11-devices-unable-to-shut-down-192216734.html">Last week</a>, some Windows 11 devices couldn&#39;t shut down or hibernate, while other devices running Windows 10 or 11 couldn&#39;t log in through remote connections. For more context, Microsoft only issues out-of-band updates when there&#39;s a serious issue that can&#39;t wait until its regular update cycle. Fortunately, the latest out-of-band update is cumulative, so you only need to download and install this one to fix the issues seen with the January update.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-releases-second-emergency-windows-11-update-to-fix-outlook-crashes-192012812.html?src=rss
