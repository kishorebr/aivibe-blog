<p>It turns out that region-locking your games makes it harder to sell more copies. First discovered by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lrj3gsdkr22v">Wario64</a>, Sony has lifted regional restrictions for several of its titles that are available to play on PC through Steam. Sony hasn't officially announced the removal of these region locks, nor the reason why, but <em>God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, and the hit co-op shooter <em>Helldivers 2 </em>can be purchased once again in 177 countries that were previously prohibited, as seen in database changelogs.</p>
<p>To understand why Sony decided to limit sales of its games in certain countries, we have to revisit when the video game publisher announced it would require <em>Helldivers 2</em> PC players to link their Steam accounts to the PlayStation Network. This controversial decision prohibited players in countries that didn't have access to the PSN, so Sony also removed <em>Helldivers 2</em> from being on sale in those locations. The publisher <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-quickly-backs-down-on-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-for-pc-players-120030227.html">quickly backtracked</a> on that move, even later <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/sony-is-ditching-the-psn-login-requirement-on-some-of-its-pc-games-183259677.html">removing the PSN requirements</a> for other titles like <em>Spider-Man 2.</em></p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More recently, the PC release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/stellar-blade-heads-to-pc-on-june-11-185536164.html"><em>Stellar Blade</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>on June 11 resurfaced Sony's PSN login requirement debacle. The game's developer, Shift Up, was able to work with Sony to loosen restrictions and make a PSN login optional, allowing for an explosive launch where the game saw a peak of nearly 200,000 players in its opening week. Now, PC gamers across the world can play <em>Stellar Blade</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> without needing a PSN account. However, there are still some Sony titles on Steam that are heavily restricted, like <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Until Dawn</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-unlocks-regional-restrictions-for-some-pc-games-in-more-than-100-countries-162228948.html?src=rss
