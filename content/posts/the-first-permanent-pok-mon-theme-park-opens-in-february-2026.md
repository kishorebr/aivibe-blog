<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/about/ppark/index" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">PokéPark Kanto</a>, the first permanent Pokémon theme park, will open its doors on February 5, 2026. Previous Pokémon parks and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-studios-japan-partners-with-pokemon-on-new-in-park-entertainment-103504372.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">attractions</a> existed in the past, but they were only open for a limited time. PokéPark Kanto will be located inside the Yomiuriland  amusement park in Tokyo, Japan and will require an add-on pass to enter. Visitors will have to go through a “Pokémon Research Lab” building, which serves as the gateway to the park’s two sections: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town</p><p>The Pokémon Forest is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a stretch of land with hills, paths with tall grass, rocky trails and tunnels where visitors will see Pokémon in their natural habitats. The Pokémon statues are posed to show that they’re engaging in various activities, such as battling or playing with friends. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sedge Town is the town center where visitors will find the Pokémon Center and Poké Mart, which sounds like a place where they can buy some refreshments. In addition to the main attractions, PokéPark Kanto will feature Pika Pika Paradise, a ride featuring over 30 electric-type Pokémon. There’s also Vee Vee Voyage, a carousel featuring carriages pulled by Ponyta and Rapidash, as well as balloons where visitors can ride with Eevee. </p><p>We’ve yet to see actual photos of the park, but the trailer below will give you a glimpse of what you can expect.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/No34HQuKSEg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-first-permanent-pokemon-theme-park-opens-in-february-2026-012228856.html?src=rss
