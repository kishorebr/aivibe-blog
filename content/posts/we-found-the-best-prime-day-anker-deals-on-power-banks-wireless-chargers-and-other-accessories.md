<p>Maybe you’re not looking to snag an iPad, a robot vacuum or a VR headset this <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> because you’re set with what you already have. Instead, though, consider picking up a few discounted “essential” gadgets, or really, devices you don’t want to be left without in a pinch. Charging gear falls into this camp, and Anker makes some of our favorite power banks, cables, wireless chargers and more.</p> 
<p>A bunch of Anker’s gear is on sale for October Prime Day, making now a great time to stock up. Personally, I always end up getting an extra charging cable or surge protector for my house, or I take stock of the gifts I’ll need over the next couple of months and pick up a power brick while they’re deeply discounted. Here, we’ve collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging accessories so you don’t have to go searching for them.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-power-banks">Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks</h2> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">Power banks</a> are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more.</p> 
<p>It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-wireless-chargers">Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A good <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html">wireless charger</a> can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up.</p> 
<p>We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-charging-gear">Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear</h2> 
<p>Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.</p>
