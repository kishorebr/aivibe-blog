Apple plans to make Siri an AI chatbot, report says


Apple’s long-awaited Siri revamp could turn the smart assistant into a chatbot more akin to ChatGPT, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. His sources say that the Siri chatbot, which would be integrated into iOS 27, could be the focal point of Apple’s WWDC presentation in June.

The Siri chatbot, internally codenamed “Campos,” will work with both voice and text inputs. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi had previously stated that he didn’t want Siri to be a chatbot, and rather, that he wanted Apple’s AI options to be “integrated so it’s there within reach whenever you need it.” But it appears that the game plan has changed amid increased pressure from the success of other companies’ AI chatbots.


	
	




	
	



Apple may also sense a potential threat because OpenAI is planning to enter the hardware space, led by none other than former Apple design head Jony Ive.

It’s no secret that Apple has been lagging behind in the AI race. The company delayed its rollout of a “more personalized Siri” multiple times and spent last year shopping around for an AI partner, testing out the technology of competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic for a potential deal. Ultimately, Apple chose Google’s Gemini as its AI partner, which the two tech giants confirmed earlier this month.
