His most recent credit is the sci-fi series <em>Raised By Wolves</em>, but Guzikowski has also worked on movies including <em>Prisoners</em> and <em>Papillon</em>. The animated film will tell "an original story" from the same universe as the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html"><ins>already quite cinematic</ins></a> <em>Death Stranding</em>.</p>
