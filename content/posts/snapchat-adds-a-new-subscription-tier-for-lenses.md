<p>Snapchat has added a new layer to its paid offerings. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-lens-plus"><ins>Lens+</ins></a> subscription combines the existing Snapchat+ monthly plan with more access to "hundreds of Lenses and AR experiences that let you play, create, and share Snaps with friends in whole new ways." The plan will cost $9 a month.</p>
<p>At the start, the subscription will feature Lenses made by the company or by select creators. New augmented reality experiences will be added each week. Creators will be granted the option to build and monetize Lenses for the program in the coming months, although Snapchat hasn't publicly explained how it will select the "select" participants. A representative from the business confirmed to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/snapchat-rolls-out-a-new-8-99-lens-subscription-tier/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a> that the launch of Lens+ will not see any Lenses that were previously free placed behind a paywall.</p>
