<p>It's usually wise to wait for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> to pick up a Kindle ereader since the online retailer typically saves the best deals for its own shopping events. Case in point: this deal on the latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0CZ9VFQ2P&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=de2dc6c0-6289-4883-a281-8c428c1031af&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle+Scribe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQ1o5VkZRMlA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGUyZGM2YzAtNjI4OS00ODgzLWEyODEtOGM0MjhjMTAzMWFmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQ1o5VkZRMlAiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXQ6x08oH4KqieD48YC8B2lskHgH6ybquVpsq4sMfG5C&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CZ9VFQ2P" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?th=1">Kindle Scribe</a>. The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablet</a> is down to $260 right now, which is $140 off and the cheapest we've seen it. You'll get that price on the base 16GB model, but there are similar discounts on the 32GB and 64GB configurations as well.</p> 
<p>The Kindle Scribe is Amazon's answer to devices like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html">reMarkable E ink tablet</a>. It's both a standard ereader and a tablet for taking notes, as it ships with a pen for scribbling. This makes it handy for writing down thoughts or for mindlessly drawing pizza slices. Users can jot notes over books, but not every title supports this feature.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The Scribe made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best E Ink tablets</a> for a number of reasons. We appreciated the low latency when writing. In most cases, users won't notice any latency at all. The latest software update also brings in new brush types, which now include a fountain pen, a marker and a pencil. This device makes it easy to create multiple notebooks for different purposes. There are even some <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-hands-on-you-can-scribble-on-your-books-130043335.html">AI tools for summarization and the like</a>.</p> 
<p>Of course, it's also a standard ereader. I have a Scribe and, to be honest, I use it primarily for reading. The giant 10.2-inch screen is just so luxe and offers a superior reading experience to standard-sized Kindles. It's a bit heavier and cumbersome to hold for long periods, but that tradeoff is worth it to me.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is the price. It's tough to recommend a $400 ereader, even with all of the handwriting bells and whistles. However, this sale certainly takes the edge off a bit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-latest-kindle-scribe-is-140-off-in-this-prime-day-deal-131544290.html?src=rss
