<p class="has-text-align-none">Thanks to a related trademark lawsuit, we know what OpenAI and Jony Ive's first AI device <em>won't</em> be.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In court filings submitted this month, leaders from io - the consumer hardware team OpenAI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">recently acquired</a> from Jony Ive's design studio for $6.5 billion - testified that the first device they plan to release won't be an "in-ear device" or a "wearable."

To support <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25981884-iyo-v-io-complaint/">its case that OpenAI willfully infringed on its trademark</a>, Iyo provides emails showing that leaders from io and OpenAI, including CEO Sam Altman, knew about its existence and even asked to demo the product - a yet-to-be-released, in-ear headphone <a href="https://www.iyo.audio/">bil …</a></p>
