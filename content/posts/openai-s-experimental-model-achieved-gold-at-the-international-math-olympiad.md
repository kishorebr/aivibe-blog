<p>OpenAI has achieved &quot;gold medal-level performance&quot; at the International Math Olympiad, notching another important milestone for AI&#39;s fast-paced growth. Alexander Wei, a research scientist at OpenAI working on LLMs and reasoning, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918">posted on X</a> that an experimental research model delivered on this &quot;longstanding grand challenge in AI.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Wei, an unreleased model from OpenAI was able to solve five out of six problems at one of the world&#39;s longest-standing and prestigious math competitions, earning 35 out of 42 points total. The International Math Olympiad (IMO) sees countries send up to six students to solve extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems. These exercises are seemingly simple but usually require some creativity to score the highest marks on each problem. For <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2025">this year&#39;s competition</a>, only 67 of the 630 total contestants received gold medals, or roughly 10 percent.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AI is often tasked with tackling complex datasets and repetitive actions, but it usually falls short when it comes to solving problems that require more creativity or complex decision-making. However, with the latest IMO competition, OpenAI says its model was able to handle complicated math problems with human-like reasoning.</p>
<p>&quot;By doing so, we&#39;ve obtained a model that can craft intricate, watertight arguments at the level of human mathematicians,&quot; Wei wrote on X. Wei and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, both added that the company doesn&#39;t expect to release anything with this level of math capability for several months. That means the upcoming GPT-5 will likely be an improvement from <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-gpt-45-model-is-a-better-more-natural-conversationalist-200035185.html">its predecessor</a>, but it won&#39;t feature that same impressive capability to compete in the IMO.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-experimental-model-achieved-gold-at-the-international-math-olympiad-182719801.html?src=rss
