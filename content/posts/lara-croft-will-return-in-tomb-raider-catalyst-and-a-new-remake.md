At The Game Awards 2025, Amazon Game Studios announced that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2yLZQFPSLo" data-i13n="slk:Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis;cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em></a><em> </em>will<em> </em>reimagine of one of the hero’s early adventures in 2026, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2yLZQFPSLo" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</em></a><em> </em>will continue the series in 2027.</p><p><em>Catalyst</em> is developed by Crystal Dynamics<em> </em>and follows Lara through Northern India “in the wake of a mythical cataclysm,” as she comes into competition with other treasure hunters. <em>Legacy of Atlantis</em>, developed by Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog, reimagines the very first Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. And yes, it seems like dinosaurs will be in the mix.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A new Tomb Raider game has been in the works officially <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-games-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-173848481.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">since at least 2022</a>, when Amazon announced that it would be publishing the next game in the series.
