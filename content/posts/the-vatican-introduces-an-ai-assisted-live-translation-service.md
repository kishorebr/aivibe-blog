<p>The Vatican is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-ibm-microsoft-vatican-ai-ethics-pledge.html">leaning into AI</a>. AI-assisted live translations are being introduced for Holy Mass attendees — the holy masses if you will. The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican has teamed up with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://translated.com/english-translation-services?">Translated</a>, a language service provider, to create live <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-voice-translation-feature-rolls-out-globally-200945034.html">translations</a> in 60 languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Saint Peter’s Basilica has, for centuries, welcomed the faithful from every nation and tongue. In making available a tool that helps many to understand the words of the liturgy, we wish to serve the mission that defines the centre of the Catholic Church, universal by its very vocation,&quot; Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, O.F.M. Conv., Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, said in a statement. &quot;I am very happy with the collaboration with Translated. In this centenary year, we look to the future with prudence and discernment, confident that human ingenuity, when guided by faith, may become an instrument of communion.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Visitors to the Vatican will have the option to scan a QR code. They will then have access to live audio and text translations of the liturgy. It doesn&#39;t require an app and should work right on a web page.</p>
<p>The technology stems from Lara, a translation AI tool Translated launched in 2024. Translated claims that Lara works with the &quot;sensitivity of over 500,000 native-speaking professional translators.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-vatican-introduces-an-ai-assisted-live-translation-service-163014907.html?src=rss
