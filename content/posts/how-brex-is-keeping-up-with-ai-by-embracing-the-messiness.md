Companies have struggled to adopt the right AI tools as the technology evolves at a far faster pace than their slow sales cycles. 

Corporate credit card company Brex is no different. The startup found itself facing the same issue as its enterprise counterparts. The upshot: Brex completely changed its approach to software procurement to ensure it wouldn’t get left behind.


	
	




	
	



At the HumanX AI conference in March, Brex CTO James Reggio told TechCrunch that the company initially tried to assess these software tools through its usual procurement strategy. The startup quickly discovered its months-long piloting process was just not going to work.

“In the first year following ChatGPT, when all these new tools were coming on the scene, the procurement process itself would actually run so long that the teams that were asking to procure a tool lost interest in the tool by the time that we actually got through all of the necessary internal controls,” Reggio said.

That’s when Brex realized it had to completely rethink its procurement process.

The company started by coming up with a new framework for data processing agreements and legal validations for bringing on AI tools, Reggio said. This allowed Brex to vet potential AI tools more quickly and get them into the hands of testers faster.

Reggio said the company uses a “superhuman product-market-fit test” to figure out what tools are worth investing in beyond the pilot program. This approach gives employees a much larger role in deciding what tools the company should adopt based on where they are finding value, he added.
