<p>Apple&#39;s plan to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/a-macbook-pro-touchscreen-about-damn-time-180000315.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">add touchscreens</a> to its premium MacBook Pros is coming into focus. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/apple-s-touch-screen-macbook-pro-to-have-dynamic-island-new-interface" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that when the new laptops launch this fall, they&#39;ll feature a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-181347737.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Dynamic Island</a>, not unlike Apple&#39;s iPhones, and an interface that changes depending on where you touch your Macbook&#39;s screen.</p><p>This &quot;dynamic interface&quot; is reportedly designed to make the transition between mouse input and touch input smoother on Apple&#39;s new laptops. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that if users touch an onscreen button, the version of macOS running on these new MacBook Pros will be able to pull up a contextual menu &quot;that provides more relevant options for touch commands.&quot; Parts of the interface, like macOS&#39; menu bar, will also be able to enlarge to make menu items easier to select with a finger. Those tweaks are on top of the expected features from touchscreen Apple products, like smooth scrolling and the ability to pinch and zoom into and out of images, files and web pages. The only thing missing from these increasingly iPad-like laptops, per <em>Bloomberg</em>, will be a touchscreen keyboard, because they&#39;ll already have a more comfortable physical keyboard attached.</p><p>To make these new laptops extra enticing, both the 14-inch and 16-inch touchscreen MacBook Pros will feature OLED screens for the first time, likely the reason Apple will be able to include a Dynamic Island-style webcam in the first place. Up until now, the company has offered OLED screens on its iPhones, Apple Watches and more recently the iPad Pro, but it hasn&#39;t brought the display technology to laptops. That could <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apple-will-reportedly-shift-to-oled-displays-for-macbooks-ipad-air-and-mini-120005423.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">reportedly change</a> with these new MacBook Pros.</p><p>Plenty of Windows laptops include touchscreens, and Microsoft and its partners have incorporated dynamic interface elements in the past to make these touchscreens more natural to use with Windows. Apple is late to the party in this respect, but it&#39;s also potentially set up to succeed. Much of modern macOS <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">already looks touch-friendly</a>, and Apple&#39;s has expended significant effort making it possible to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-project-catalyst-macos.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">port touch-based iPad apps to macOS</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">develop applications across platforms</a>. That, paired with the right interface, could make the experience of using a touchscreen MacBook nicer out of the box, even if it doesn&#39;t get rid of the awkwardness of reaching over your keyboard to touch a screen.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-touchscreen-macbook-will-reportedly-have-a-dynamic-interface-231929456.html?src=rss
