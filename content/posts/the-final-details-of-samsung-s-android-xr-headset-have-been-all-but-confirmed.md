<p>After announcing its intentions to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">make an XR device</a> in 2023, and revealing the design and intended use-cases for the headset alongside the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">announcement of Android XR</a> in 2024, Samsung has shared precious few details about Project Moohan. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xr?ref=uploadvr.com">A new leak from <em>Android Headlines</em></a> is set to change that, detailing not only the specs of Samsung&#39;s new headset, but also a final name and new controller accessories ahead of the device&#39;s rumored launch later this fall.</p>
<p>Samsung&#39;s Project Moohan — officially called &quot;Samsung Galaxy XR&quot; per <em>Android Headlines</em> — is a marriage of sorts between the discontinued <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313-130045431.html">Meta Quest Pro</a> and an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Apple Vision Pro</a>. It features an adjustable headband, primarily acts as passthrough goggles to the world around you and supports an external battery pack. While Samsung&#39;s demos of the Project Moohan focused on the headset&#39;s ability to accept voice commands and track eye and hand movements through built-in microphones and cameras, <em>Android Headlines</em> reports the headset will also support two controller accessories that look a lot like Meta&#39;s Touch Plus controllers for the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html">Quest 3</a>.</p>

<p>More expected are the internals and software experience on the new device. Project Moohan will use a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip to power its One UI-ified version of Android XR, just as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/01/qualcomm-accelerates-new-wave-of-mixed-reality-experiences-with-">Qualcomm promised</a> when it announced the new processor in 2024. Samsung appears to be taking a lighter touch when it comes to software. Screenshots shared by <em>Android Headlines</em> show an app grid with the company&#39;s browser, photos and camera apps, but the rest lines up with what Google&#39;s shown of Android XR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headset will also reportedly feature one high-resolution 4K micro-OLED screen per eye, as previously rumored by Korean publication <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37451"><em>The Elec</em></a>, and around a two hours of battery life, which is comparable to the Vision Pro. Importantly, Project Moohan is also lighter. The headset reportedly weighs 545 grams, a good bit less than the over 600-gram Apple headset.</p>
<p>The only thing really missing now is a price for Project Moohan and a release date. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwilliams/2025/05/02/samsung-project-moohan-xr-headsets-2025-release-date-confirmed/">Samsung shared</a> in its Q2 2025 earnings that it still expected to ship the headset in 2025, but hasn&#39;t announced an event to introduce the new device. Whenever it does launch, it sounds like it&#39;ll be expensive. In August 2025, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_project_moohan_xr_launch_date_price_availability_surface-news-69223.php">rumors pointed</a> to Project Moohan costing anywhere from 2,500,000 to 4,000,000 Korean won (around $1,700 to $2,800).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html?src=rss
