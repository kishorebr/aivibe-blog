<p><em>Hytale</em>, a more action-packed take on <em>Minecraft</em>, will be available for $20 when it relaunches in early access, Hypixel Studios <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced on X</a>. The developer shared that it planned to relaunch <em>Hytale</em> earlier this week after successfully <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reacquiring the rights to the game</a> from Riot Games.</p><p>Alongside its $20 &quot;Standard&quot; edition, Hypixel also plans to offer $35 &quot;Supporter&quot; and $70 &quot;Cursebreaker&quot; editions of <em>Hytale</em> with additional in-game cosmetics. Pricing the game at $20 is an acknowledgement of how unfinished it is, according to Hypixel Studios co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme. &quot;I&#39;m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,&quot; Collins-Laflamme said <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">in an X post.</a> &quot;The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn&#39;t feel right. I don&#39;t think the game is good yet.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible. I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise.<br><br>The game… <a href="https://t.co/KxBmOLxMQN">https://t.co/KxBmOLxMQN</a></p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
