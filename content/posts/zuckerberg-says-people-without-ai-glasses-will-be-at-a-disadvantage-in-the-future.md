Echoing sentiments shared in his “superintelligence”-focused blog post this morning, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expanded on his bullish ideas that glasses will be the primary way users interact with AI in the years ahead. During Meta’s second-quarter earnings call, the social networking exec told investors he believes people without AI glasses will be at a disadvantage in the future.

The glasses let users listen to music, take photos or videos, and ask Meta AI questions, including about what they’re seeing, among other things. These wearables have turned into a surprise hit for the company, as revenue from sales of the Ray-Ban Metas more than tripled year-over-year, according to glasses giant EssilorLuxottica. 

But Zuckerberg believes there’s more to be done with displays. 

“This is … what we’ve been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years — basically doing the research on all these different things,” he said.

The Reality Labs division has been a money pit for the company, so it’s not surprising the exec wants to justify its cost to investors by positioning it as a bet on the future of AI and consumer computing in general. For examp
