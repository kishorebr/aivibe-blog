<p>Snap and Perplexity AI have struck a $400 million deal that will bring the AI search engine directly to Snapchat sometime in &quot;early 2026,&quot; the two companies <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2025/Snap-and-Perplexity-Partner-to-Bring-Conversational-AI-Search-to-Snapchat/default.aspx" data-i13n="slk:announced;cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a>. With the partnership, Perplexity&#39;s AI search engine will be a prominent part of Snapchat&#39;s &quot;chat&quot; interface so users can &quot;ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat.&quot;</p><p>The news was announced alongside the company&#39;s third-quarter earnings. The company said that revenue from the deal — Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million for the integration — is &quot;expected to begin contributing&quot; to the company&#39;s bottom line in 2026. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.snap.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Investor-Letter.pdf" data-i13n="slk:a letter;cpos:2;pos:1">a letter</a> to shareholders, CEO Evan Spiegel also hinted that Snap could pursue similar partnerships with other AI companies. &quot;This collaboration makes AI-powered discovery native to Snapchat, enhances personalization, and positions Snap as a leading distribution channel for intelligent agents, laying the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of AI partners to reach our global community,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Snap, like its peers, has been leaning into generative AI in recent years. The company has its own LLM-powered chatbot, called MyAI, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-is-redesigning-snapchat-and-adding-new-ai-powers-171552703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">uses models</a> from OpenAI, Google and, soon, Perplexity AI. Snap has also introduced AI-powered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-launches-generative-ai-video-lenses-130056731.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">lenses</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-now-has-a-standalone-app-for-making-gen-ai-augmented-reality-effects-170036214.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">creation tools</a>, which have helped boost its Snapchat+ subscription service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spiegel also teased other AI-powered updates coming to Snapchat. He said the company is working on a new AI video generation feature called &quot;AI Clips&quot; that &quot;will allow creators to generate short, shareable videos from simple prompts.&quot; He didn’t say when the feature might launch.</p><p>Outside of Snapchat, Snap is also planning on launching a new version of its AR glasses, called Specs, s<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ometime next year</a>. Spiegel didn’t offer any new details about the device, which he has previously promised will be lighter-weight than the current version. He did, however, suggest the company was considering working with potential hardware partners.  He said Snap would be “putting Specs into their own standalone, 100% owned subsidiary” to give the company more flexibility to pursue such arrangements. </p><p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025,  3:08PM PT:</strong> Added more details from Snap’s earnings call.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-and-perplexity-sign-400-million-deal-to-put-ai-search-directly-in-snapchat-221101734.html?src=rss
