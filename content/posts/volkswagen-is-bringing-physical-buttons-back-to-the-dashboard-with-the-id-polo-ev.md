<p>We could be witnessing the start of the renaissance for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-drivers-want-more-physical-buttons-instead-of-touch-controls-044931087.html">real buttons in cars</a>, courtesy of Volkswagen&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-unveils-a-new-cockpit-generation-debuting-with-the-all-new-id-polo-20056">ID. Polo</a>. The German automaker unveiled the interior of its upcoming compact EV, which features real buttons, switches and even a knob for audio controls.</p>
<p>&quot;We have created an interior that feels like a friend from the very first contact,&quot; Volkswagen&#39;s chief designer, Andreas Mindt, said in a press release. &quot;Clear physical buttons provide stability and trust, warm materials make it appealing, and charming details such as the new retro views of the instruments show the typical Volkswagen wink.&quot;</p>

Polo&#39;s dashboard" data-uuid="9cfcee69-d7d8-38a3-99bd-d6a4c792118c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure>
<p>Last year, Mindt told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions"><em>Autocar</em></a> that Volkswagen would commit to reintroducing physical buttons for the most important functions &quot;in every car we make from now on,&quot; starting with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vws-id2all-compact-ev-will-cost-under-25000-when-it-arrives-in-2025-194635462.html">ID. 2all concept car</a> that has since evolved to become the ID. Polo. The EV maker backed up those claims since the ID. Polo will feature tangible buttons underneath the infotainment display, along with a steering wheel that&#39;s packed with even more clear buttons. Between the driver and passenger, Volkswagen even included a knob that can adjust audio volume or shuffle between tracks and radio stations.</p>

<p>Besides the renewed emphasis on physical controls, Volkswagen still included a 10.25-inch digital cockpit behind the steering wheel. In the center, there&#39;s a nearly 13-inch touchscreen that serves as the infotainment system. For a retro throwback, the ID. Polo can swap its cockpit display to one that&#39;s inspired by the classic Golf I from the 1980s through a button on its steering wheel or with the infotainment touchscreen.</p>
<p>The ID. Polo is expected to be the first of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-previews-its-%e2%82%ac20000-ev-for-everyone-211053623.html">four new EVs</a> in Volkswagen&#39;s small and compact car segment, which will see releases in European markets starting this year. However, it&#39;s not all good news, since Volkswagen has no plans to release the compact EV in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-is-bringing-physical-buttons-back-to-the-dashboard-with-the-id-polo-ev-190246116.html?src=rss
