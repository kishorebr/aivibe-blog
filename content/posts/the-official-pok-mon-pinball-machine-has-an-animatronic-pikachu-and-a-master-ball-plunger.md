<p>At a staggering starting price of $6,999, you have a better chance of buying a bicycle in Cerulean City than getting your hands on the official <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">Pokémon pinball machine</a>. The collaboration between <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-is-so-damn-cozy-140000954.html">The Pokémon Company</a> International and Stern Pinball is undoubtedly nostalgic, letting you battle with a team that includes Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle and Pikachu, as well as catch up to 182 different Pokémon, mostly from the Kanto region, with more to be added.</p>
<p>Besides catching &#39;em all and tracking your growing Pokédex on Stern Pinball&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stern-pinball-ic/id6449461651">dedicated app</a>, you can do Gym Battles in four different biomes and eventually face off against Team Rocket. The pinball machine draws a lot of inspiration from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-27-netflix-captures-pokemon-cartoons-movies-this-march.html">original cartoon</a>, including a monitor that plays clips from the show, an animatronic Pikachu, and speakers that can play the iconic theme song.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stern Pinball developed Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models, which can cost all the way up to $12,999. For the most expensive option, you&#39;ll get one of the 750 limited edition machines that include a Master Ball plunger, a numbered plaque and a signed certificate of authenticity. For Pokémon fans that can&#39;t afford to spend that much money on a pinball machine, you can soon find them at arcades and bowling alleys instead.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-official-pokemon-pinball-machine-has-an-animatronic-pikachu-and-a-master-ball-plunger-204915013.html?src=rss
