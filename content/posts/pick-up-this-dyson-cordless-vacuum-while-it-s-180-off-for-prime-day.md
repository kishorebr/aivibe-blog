<p>We loved the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dyson-v15-detect-230145131-230145683.html">Dyson V15 Detect</a> and it earned a slot in our <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">best cordless vacuums</a> guide. The Plus model on sale during Prime Day is the same vacuum with more accessories. The suction power on the V15 Detect Plus is really impressive, especially for a cordless vacuum. For anyone with pets, good suction should be a strong consideration when selecting a vacuum, and we were thoroughly impressed with the pet hair this model picked up in our tests from both hardwood and carpet.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The Fluffy Optic hard surface cleaning head comes with a laser that illuminates the ground in front of you as you vacuum. It does a frighteningly good job of highlighting just how much dust, hair and other debris have collected on your hardwood or tile floors that you might not have seen. For a shocking look at just how much stuff is on your floors, try vacuuming with the lights off.</p> 
<p>The V15 Detect Plus gets its namesake from a handy LCD display screen on the main body of the vacuum that tells you exactly how many particles across different size ranges the vacuum has detected since you started cleaning. In practice, this doesn't add anything to the functionality of the device, but it sheds a light on just how much stuff you've picked up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-this-dyson-cordless-vacuum-while-its-180-off-for-prime-day-121534903.html?src=rss
