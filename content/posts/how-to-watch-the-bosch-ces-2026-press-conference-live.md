<p>You may know Bosch as a home appliance brand (via its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational is generally more focused on providing underlying technology and engineering solutions to auto, home and manufacturing partners across the globe. It&#39;s fitting, then, that much of what it&#39;s showing off at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a> is more intended to be licensed to other companies versus Bosch-branded products you&#39;ll be seeing on store shelves.</p>
<p>Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company will present &quot;AI in the car,&quot; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &quot;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&quot; Bosch board member Markus Heyn <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ai-in-the-car-bosch-presents-cockpit-innovations-at-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-280272.html"><ins>said in a press release</ins></a>. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.</p>

<p>You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ces-2026-livestream.html"><ins>Bosch press page</ins></a>. (If the stream is embeddable, we&#39;ll also include it here.)</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/ces-2026/#what-to-expect"><ins>three big themes</ins></a> — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.</p>
<p>Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>
