<p>Reddit won&#39;t escape Australia&#39;s child social media ban. <em>The Guardian</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/04/reddit-included-australia-under-16-social-media-ban" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reports</a> that Communications Minister Anika Wells announced Reddit&#39;s addition on Wednesday. The nation&#39;s law, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">blocks children under 16 from major social media sites</a>, is scheduled to go into effect on December 10.</p><p>Alongside Reddit, Wells said Australian streaming site Kick would also be included. They join the previously announced Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Australia considers the list to be a starting point for the ban and won&#39;t rule out adding more. Other companies under consideration are Discord, Twitch, GitHub and Roblox.</p><p>YouTube was initially excluded because it was considered an educational tool. But after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">protests from other companies</a> on the list, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Australia ultimately added it</a>.</p><p>The ban passed in late 2024. The legislation puts the onus on the platforms, rather than parents, to police underage use. Companies that don&#39;t take reasonable steps to prevent under-16 users from accessing their platforms can face penalties of up to AU$49.5 million (around $32 million).</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s a time and place for social media in Australia, but there&#39;s not a place for predatory algorithms, harmful content and toxic popularity [meters] manipulating Australian children,&quot; Wells said. &quot;Online platforms can target children with chilling control. We are mandating they use that sophisticated technology to protect them.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-be-included-in-australias-looming-under-16-social-media-ban-213052856.html?src=rss
