<p>Elon Musk recently announced that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414"><ins>he&#39;s bringing back the Vine archives</ins></a>, after teasing the return of the social platform over the last week or so. The X owner says that the company recently discovered the entire video archive of the once-popular short-form video app and is working to restore user access. Twitter bought Vine all the way back in 2012.</p>
<p>Musk says that X users will be able to post these Vines, but it&#39;s just an archive. In other words, this doesn&#39;t sound like a renaissance for the actual platform.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ba5d468e7cef449da3323e3c73655e5b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grok Imagine is AI Vine!<br><br>Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want.</p>â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>It remains unclear as to what Musk&#39;s intentions are for the brand, but the announcement about the returning archive was accompanied by an ad for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/"><ins>Grok Imagine video-creation platform</ins></a>. He called the service the &quot;AI Vine.&quot; Why expand energy to make short-form content when you can type some words into a prompting field?</p>
<p>There&#39;s also the Musk of it all. He doesn&#39;t have the best track record when it comes to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-very-simple-pattern-to-elon-musks-broken-promises/"><ins>delivering on promises</ins></a>. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see if the Vine video archive actually returns and what happens after that.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Vine was sort of like TikTok before TikTok. It was a platform for 6-second looping videos. The app was extremely popular for a while, but Twitter never really capitalized on that after its $30 million purchase. It was shut down in 2016, which ended uploads, and was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-vine-closes-january-17.html"><ins>completely discontinued in 2017</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/elon-musk-says-the-vine-archive-is-coming-back-180935178.html?src=rss
