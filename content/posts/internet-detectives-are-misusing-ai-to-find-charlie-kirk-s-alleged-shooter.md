<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier today, the FBI shared <a href="https://x.com/FBISaltLakeCity/status/1966169520403525760">two blurry photos on X</a> of a person of interest in the shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Numerous users replied with AI-upscaled, &#8220;enhanced&#8221; versions of the pictures almost immediately, turning the pixelated surveillance shots into sharp, high-resolution images. But AI tools aren&#8217;t uncovering secret details in a fuzzy picture, they&#8217;re inferring what <em>might</em> be there — and they have a track record of showing things that don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many AI-generated photo variations were posted under the original images, some apparently created with X&#8217;s own Grok bot, others with tools like ChatGPT. They vary in plausibility, though some are obviously off, like an &#8220;AI-based textual rendering&#8221; showing a clearly different shirt and <a href="https://x.com/JohnNosta/status/1966238703917084899">Gigachad-level chin</a>. The images are ostensibly supposed to help people find the person of interest, although they&#8217;re also eye-grabbing ways to get likes and reposts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it&#8217;s unlikely any of them are more helpful than the FBI&#8217;s photos. In past incidents, AI upscaling has done things like &#8220;depixelating&#8221; a low-resolution picture of President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21298762/face-depixelizer-ai-machine-learning-tool-pulse-stylegan-obama-bias">into a white man</a> and adding <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-zoom-enhance-does-not-work-2000651736">a nonexistent lump to President Donald Trump’s head</a>. It extrapolates from an existing image to fill in gaps, and while that can be useful under certain circumstances, you definitely shouldn&#8217;t treat it as hard evidence in a manhunt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is the original post from the FBI, for reference:</p>
