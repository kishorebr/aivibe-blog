A group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants.

The suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.

The case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfholics.

It’s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the nonprofit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.

In some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled
