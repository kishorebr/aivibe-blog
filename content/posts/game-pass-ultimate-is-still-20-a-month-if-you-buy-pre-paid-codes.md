<p>Microsoft may have made the unfortunate decision to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">raise the price</a> of a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to $30 a month, but you don't have to live by the company's rules â€” at least not yet. Most online retailers are still selling codes for prepaid Game Pass subscriptions at the original $20 a month price. That means you can pay $60 for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07TGNFVWV&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a7b99582-d016-42ac-a551-80b485aecaf6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=three+months+of+Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAASoqsoBCa5eUC_AhNPV_2RRFpMCh3DLh7moUIhzeJtXe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership%2Fdp%2FB07TGNFVWV" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?th=1">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, stack your codes and keep your subscription without having to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/how-to-cancel-or-downgrade-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription-191801458.html">downgrade or cancel.</a></p>

<p>As the highest tier in Game Pass, an Ultimate subscription gives you the ability to download and play a library of over 200 games on your PC or Xbox. With Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can also stream the majority of those games to other devices, too, whether it's a smartphone, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/lg-smart-tvs-are-getting-xbox-game-pass-this-week-200422697.html">LG TV</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-and-lg-are-bringing-cloud-gaming-to-cars-133016305.html">in-car display</a>. It's worth noting, though, the benefits of Ultimate did change with the introduction of the higher price. Microsoft shared that Ultimate subscribers will now also receive the benefits of an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-game-subscription-service-officially-launches-on-xbox-163018760.html">Ubisoft+</a> subscription at no additional cost, a $16 a month value that unlocks access to a back catalog of Ubisoft games from franchises like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Starting in November, the new Ultimate subscription also includes access to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-crew-subscription-battle-pass-v-bucks-outfits-accessories-150000281.html">Fortnite Crew</a>, Epic's $12 a month plan that gives you V-Bucks, battle passes and more in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>While those new benefits might justify a higher price monetarily, whether that's a convincing reason to stay subscribed is a separate question. This likely won't be the last time Microsoft will raise the price of its subscription service. Avoiding those fees by buying pre-paid Game Pass codes seems like an excellent way to try out the new Ultimate before committing to cancelling your subscription, downgrading your plan or sticking with Microsoft's new price. You can purchase three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $60 a month. Stacking four three-month codes should come out to around $240.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-a-month-if-you-buy-pre-paid-codes-222333258.html?src=rss
