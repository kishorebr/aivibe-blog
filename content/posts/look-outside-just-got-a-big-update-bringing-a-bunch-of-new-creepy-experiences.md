<p>I didn't really need an excuse to begin another <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/look-outside-is-an-unexpected-cosmic-horror-masterpiece-that-shook-me-to-the-core-171542211.html">playthrough of<em> Look Outside</em></a>, but the developer just dropped an update that provides plenty of reasons to dip back into the survival horror RPG if you were looking for any. Update 1.5 brings new crafting recipes, new interactions with people in the apartment building — some familiar, some not — and big changes to the flooded basement area, along with a slew of other tweaks and bug fixes. You can take a look through the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3373660/view/527598150402179087?snr=1_5_9_">update notes</a> to see everything that's been added, or just jump right in and let yourself be surprised.</p> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/"><em>Look Outside</em></a> is a survival horror game with turn-based combat that was released on Steam in March. The game sees the player character Sam trapped in an apartment building for two weeks to ride out some strange, apocalyptic event happening outside. The weirdness, of course, makes its way inside too, and you'll find yourself up against all sorts of body horror monstrosities and trying to figure out who you can trust. Between the art, the music and the story, it's an all-around masterpiece that I haven't been able to stop yapping about since playing it for the first time back in April.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>It's really cool to see the developer is continuing to add to it because this is one of those games that's just made to be played over and over. If you haven't picked it up yet, there's no time like the present.</p>
