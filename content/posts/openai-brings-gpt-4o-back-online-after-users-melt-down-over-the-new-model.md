<p>Following the rollout of OpenAI&#39;s latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html">GPT-5 model</a> earlier this week, a certain user base was adamantly calling for the return of the previous <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-lightweight-gpt-4o-mini-model-promises-an-improved-chatgpt-experience-170143382.html">GPT-4o model</a>. Outspoken users complained about the writing quality of the updated model, with some even going so far as to grieve the loss of GPT-4o, which some said they considered a friend and confidant.</p>
<p>In the latest OpenAI update that labels <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">GPT-5</a> as the &quot;smartest, fastest, most useful model yet,&quot; the company removed the option to choose which model to use and defaults to GPT-5 instead. With the new model, GPT-5 uses a &quot;real-time router&quot; that switches between a more efficient model for basic questions and a deeper reasoning alternative for more complex demands.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initial rollout ran into some issues that made GPT-5 seem &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">way dumber</a>,&quot; according to OpenAI&#39;s CEO Sam Altman, who also opened up a Reddit AMA to offer more insight into the changes. On <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkae1l/comment/n7n5zzj">Reddit</a>, Altman responded to a question by saying GPT-5&#39;s writing quality is better than previous models, but asked users if this felt true. In response, several Redditors voiced their opinion that the GPT-5 felt &quot;sterile&quot; and &quot;much worse&quot; and answered &quot;briefly and dryly.&quot; In response to the initial outcry, Altman posted on X that OpenAI would let Plus subscribers choose between using GPT-5 or GPT-4o.</p>
<p>&quot;We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,&quot; Altman said on X.</p>
<p>The return of GPT-4o was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mljfc0/4o_is_back/">celebrated</a>, but there&#39;s still no guarantee that OpenAI will keep its older model around indefinitely. In the same X post, Altman said that OpenAI &quot;will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.&quot; In the meantime, OpenAI is focusing on finishing the GPT-5 rollout and making changes that will &quot;make it warmer.&quot; However, for users who have grown attached to GPT-4o as more than just an AI chatbot, this could be the beginning of the end.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html?src=rss
