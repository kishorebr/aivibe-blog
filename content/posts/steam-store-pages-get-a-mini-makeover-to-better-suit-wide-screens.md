<p>Store pages on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528" data-i13n="slk:Steam;cpos:1;pos:1">Steam</a> are looking a lot less cramped thanks to a new update. Pages have been made wider, with support for higher resolution images and new viewing modes for trailers and screenshots. You&#39;ll notice changes in the top carousel and in the &quot;About the Game&quot; section, where some new formatting options should make things look a bit more organized. The update just rolled out to the public after first being tested among beta users.</p><p>With this update, pages have been widened to 1200 pixels, which Valve says &quot;felt like a good balance where we can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page and making it hard to navigate.&quot; There&#39;s now the option of a large pop-up view called theater mode in the carousel, as well as full-screen mode. In addition to games&#39; store pages, Valve has slightly tweaked the appearance of search results and recommendation pages to be wider, and made store hubs, Steam Charts and the News Hub look more uniform.</p><p>You may also notice some more colorful backgrounds on games&#39; store pages and in bundle detail pages. Where you <em>won&#39;t</em> see changes yet, though, is the homepage. While Valve says it&#39;s working on &quot;similar adjustments&quot; for the homepage, those aren&#39;t rolling out with this update.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-store-pages-get-a-mini-makeover-to-better-suit-wide-screens-200142506.html?src=rss
