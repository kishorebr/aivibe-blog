<p>General Motors announced that it will cut more than 1,700 manufacturing jobs in reaction to changes in the electric vehicle market. &quot;In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,&quot; the company said in a statement reported by <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bb988001-8a06-413b-a0c1-7a6503e110d9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEwLzI5L2dtLWxheW9mZnMtbWljaGlnYW4tb2hpby5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYjk4ODAwMS04YTA2LTQxM2ItYTBjMS03YTY1MDNlMTEwZDkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTAvMjkvZ20tbGF5b2Zmcy1taWNoaWdhbi1vaGlvLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUCPbljIjJVmAmewxhk8vQm0vo8JveHZiYNwFbpqQgb7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F10%2F29%2Fgm-layoffs-michigan-ohio.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/gm-layoffs-michigan-ohio.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. &quot;Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change.&quot;</p><p>The layoffs are primarily happening at a Michigan plant that builds GM&#39;s EVs and at an Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Ohio.
