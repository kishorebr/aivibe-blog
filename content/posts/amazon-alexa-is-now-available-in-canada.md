<p>Amazon has launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Alexa+</a>, its next-generation digital assistant, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-plus-canada-launch" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in Canada</a>. The company unveiled the new assistant <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-a-smarter-more-conversational-ai-version-of-amazons-digital-assistant-154349563.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">in February</a>, and it has been making its way to more and more people since. Canada is the first region outside the US to get access Amazon’s upgraded Alexa. Like the version that rolled out in the US, users can communicate with Alexa+ in natural language. They can say “I’m cold,” for instance, and the assistant will turn up the heat in their home. If they say “It’s dark,” Alexa+ can switch on the lights for them. </p><p>In Amazon’s announcement, Allison Siperco, the Alexa manager for Canada, said the assistant understands Canadian culture and regional expressions. It can understand distinctly Canadian topics, such as the country’s hockey teams and musicians. In addition, the assistant links with services Canadians use. It can make restaurant reservations for them through OpenTable, connects them to CBC news and help them look for and buy items from their e-commerce platforms. Siperco said the assistant will also support Yelp, Uber Eats, Suno and TripAdvisor in the country “soon.” </p><p>Alexa+ is capable of adapting its tone to everyone in the household, suggesting different routines based on the user. It can suggest meditation, for example, to someone who’s had a long day at the office. And it can remember if someone has dietary restrictions when recommending restaurants. Alexa+ can also help users shop by finding items with the best pricing, by creating grocery lists for them while taking dietary restrictions into account, as well as by comparing features across products and summarizing reviews on Amazon Canada. </p><p>Amazon’s upgraded assistant is free during its Early Access phase, though those who are interested to try it out right now will have to purchase the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-echo-show-8-and-show-11-hands-on-a-cuter-more-unified-smart-display-173918264.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Echo Show 8, Echo Show 11</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-dot-max-review-disappointing-sound-but-alexa-is-a-star-190000721.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Echo Dot Max</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Echo Studio</a>. After Early Access, it will remain free for Prime subscribers, while everyone else will have to pay $28 CAD a month for it. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-alexa-is-now-available-in-canada-050827689.html?src=rss
