<p>Nintendo of Canada <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">has announced</a> that the pricing of the Switch, its accessories, its games and even Amiibo figures, will all be changing in Canada come August. The pricing adjustment is being made "based on market conditions," according to the the announcement.</p>
<p>It's not clear how much the price of the Switch family of products will be changing — Nintendo said new prices will be posted on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/">its Canadian website</a> on August 1 — but presumably they'll be going up. The company currently sells the Switch for CA$400, the Switch OLED for CA$450 and the Switch Lite for CA$269 in Canada. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 launched for CA$630 in June.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The market conditions Nintendo is responding to could be the result of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/">suite of tariffs</a> the US government applied to nearly all of its trade partners in April 2025. When the Switch 2 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-has-officially-launched-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-143310136.html">debuted at $450</a> in the US, many people assumed the new cost of doing business in North America was being factored in. That the price of the Switch is changing before the Switch 2 could be a confirmation of that fact.</p>
<p>While not an intentional ploy to get customers to spend more, if the Switch inches closer to the Switch 2 in price, there's plenty of good reasons to buy the newer console over the older one in August. In many ways, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">the Switch 2 is just a nicer Switch</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-the-original-switch-in-canada-220145966.html?src=rss
