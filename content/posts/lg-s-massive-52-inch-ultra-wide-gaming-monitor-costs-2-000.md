<p>LG kicked off the year by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">unveiling</a> a new lineup of gaming monitors, and today the company has priced out the biggest of the bunch. The UltraGear evo G9 (52G930B) is now available for pre-order, and the massive screen will cost just $2,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can buy a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">perfectly excellent gaming monitor</a> for much less, but $2,000 is a surprisingly low price tag for this 52-inch ultrawide monitor with a 1000R curve, which LG is billing as &quot;the world&#39;s largest 5K2K gaming monitor.&quot; In addition to its huge size, the G9 can run at a 240Hz refresh rate and offers a 1 millisecond gray-to-gray response rate. Visuals are supported by VESA DisplayHDR 600 and up to 95% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG has long done solid work on gaming monitors, and the G9 seems like a good choice for anyone who wants to be seriously immersed in their gameplay. Whether that&#39;s for a high-fidelity experience like <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> or for having the maximum coziness in <em>Stardew Valley</em> is up to you. </p>
