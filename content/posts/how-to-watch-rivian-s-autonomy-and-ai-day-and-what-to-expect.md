<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/rivian-spinoff-reveals-a-3500-starting-price-for-its-first-e-bike-195949124.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Rivian</a> is about to give the public and its investors another taste of its future with an event focused on autonomy and AI on December 11. The company&#39;s Autonomy and AI day starts at 12PM ET. You can watch the event via the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://rivian.com/autonomy" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Rivian website</a>. We&#39;ll be liveblogging the Autonomy and AI day right here on Engadget, so we&#39;ll be recapping the major news as it happens and sharing our reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what to expect, the name of the event clearly indicates that Rivian will be talking about autonomous operation of its vehicles. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://riviantrackr.com/news/predictions-rivian-autonomy-day-and-the-moment-software-really-matters/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>RivianTrackr</em></a> speculates, quite reasonably, that the company will share more about what CEO RJ Scaringe has referred to as a Universal Hands Free feature. Scaringe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://riviantrackr.com/news/rj-scaringe-confirms-universal-hands-free-on-gen-2-r1-before-autonomy-day/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">recently said</a> he&#39;d spent two hours traveling around Palo Alto, California, in a second-gen Rivian R1 with the vehicle taking care of everything by itself. It stands to reason that Rivian will at least offer up a demo of Universal Hands Free ahead of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">company’s more affordable R2 model making its debut in 2026</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Rivian <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stories.rivian.com/enhanced-highway-assist-gen2" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">said</a> that, for 2026, &quot;a hands-off/eyes-off feature is planned for controlled conditions with our current Gen 2 vehicles.&quot; So, this Autonomy and AI day seems as good an opportunity as any for the company to share more details about that. When Rivian unveiled the first-generation R1T and R1S in 2018, it said those would <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-rivian-electric-adventure-truck-la-auto-show.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">support Level 3 autonomy</a>, allowing for the driver to take their hands and eyes off the road for short spells while they&#39;re on the freeway.</p><p><em>RivianTrackr </em>also suggests that we may hear more about Rivian&#39;s sensor strategy as well as its AI and fleet-learning initiatives. The company may offer up a more detailed autonomy roadmap as well. However, the publication suggests Rivian isn&#39;t quite ready to announce rollout retails or firm pricing for full hands-off driving features.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-rivians-autonomy-and-ai-day-and-what-to-expect-192838410.html?src=rss
