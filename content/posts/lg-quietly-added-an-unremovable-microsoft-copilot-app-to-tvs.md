<p>Microsoft made a big punt this year with Copilot. The company put its AI chatbot into a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html"><ins>special line of laptops</ins></a> and has also tried to integrate it into other tech products. The latest place you may find Copilot is on your LG smart television, whether you want it or not.</p>
<p>Several LG smart TV owners have taken to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/tv-providers/lg-tv-update-adds-non-removable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-webos"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> over the past few days to complain that they suddenly have a Copilot app on the device and cannot uninstall it. Two <em>Engadget</em> staffers discovered the app on a 2022 LG OLED and a 2023 UA8000. They confirmed that the app can&#39;t be removed, although they were able to hide it from the home screen. One other person from our team also has a 2022 LG OLED but isn&#39;t seeing Copilot, so your mileage may vary based on what permissions and privacy settings you already have set up with LG.</p>

<p>LG said during the 2025 CES season that it would have a Copilot-powered AI Search in its next wave of TV models, but putting in a permanent AI fixture is sure to leave a bad taste in many customers&#39; mouths, particularly since Copilot <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html"><ins>hasn&#39;t been particularly popular</ins></a> among people using AI assistants.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lg-quietly-added-an-unremovable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-tvs-235923754.html?src=rss
