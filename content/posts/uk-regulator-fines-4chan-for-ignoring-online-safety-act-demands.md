<p>Ofcom has slapped 4chan <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/investigation-into-4chan-and-its-compliance-with-duties-to-protect-its-users-from-illegal-content?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations&amp;utm_content=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations+Preview+CID_cce26a99ffb44cf297b26df45f295852">with a £20,000</a> ($26,700) fine for failing to comply with the internet and telecommunications regulator&#39;s request for information under the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-internet-watchdog-gives-social-media-companies-three-months-to-improve-safety-or-face-huge-fines-130018908.html">UK&#39;s Online Safety Act of 2023</a>. The regulator has released an update for 11 of the investigations it opened after the first of its online safety codes became enforceable in March this year. Apparently, 4chan has ignored its requests for a copy of its illegal harms risk assessment and to provide information about its qualifying worldwide revenue. This is the first fine Ofcom has handed down under the new law, which was designed to prevent children from accessing harmful content online and which has prompted websites like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html">Reddit</a> and X to put up age verification measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the regulator launch its probe into 4chan in June, it said it received complaints about illegal content on the anonymous online board. It doesn&#39;t exactly come as a surprise that 4chan refuses to give the regulator information about the risks of illegal content on its website: Back in August, the service <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/internet-forum-4chan-sues-uk-regulator-us-over-free-speech-2025-08-28/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Ofcom, arguing that the enforcement of the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act violates Americans&#39; freedom of speech. &quot;This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/britain-issues-first-online-safety-fine-us-website-4chan-2025-10-13/">said</a> Liz Kendall, the UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. The regulator is also imposing an additional penalty of £100 ($133) per day on 4chan until it complies with its requests for information.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ofcom has announced the results of other investigations, as well, such as finding &quot;serious compliance concerns&quot; with two file-sharing services that have now deployed an automated tool that can detect and quickly remove uploads with child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Four other file-sharing services that were also under investigation for CSAM chose to geoblock access from UK IP addresses instead, so the regulator closed their cases.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/uk-regulator-fines-4chan-for-ignoring-online-safety-act-demands-045026169.html?src=rss
