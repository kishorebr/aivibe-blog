<p class="has-text-align-none">Netflix used generative AI to create a scene in the sci-fi series <em>The Eternaut</em> — a first for one of the streamer’s original shows or films. During an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709288/netflix-q2-2025-earningsdouble-ad-revenue">earnings call on Thursday</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the use of AI was faster than using traditional visual effects tools and helped cut costs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with traditional VFX tools and workflows,” Sarandos said during the call. “Also, the cost of it just wouldn&#8217;t have been feasible for a show in that budget.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sarandos said the creative team behind <em>The Eternaut</em> used AI to generate a scene of a building collapsing in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper,” he added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, Netflix revealed a new AI-powered <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/unveiling-our-innovative-new-tv-experience#:~:text=A%20New%20Way%20to%20Search%3A">search feature on mobile</a> that lets users find shows or movies using conversational phrases, like “something funny and upbeat” or “stories about dancers.” Netflix also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667775/netflix-ai-ad-breaks-upfront-2025">said that it will use AI to blend ad breaks</a> with the platform’s shows and movies — for example, allowing advertisers to display their product in front of a <em>Stranger Things</em>-inspired background.</p>
