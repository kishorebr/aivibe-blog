<p>Starting soon, Neato robovac owners will no longer be able to control their devices using the app. Neato Robotics, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/robot-vacuum-maker-neato-is-shutting-down-amid-stiff-competition-204959296.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shut down in 2023</a> due to declining sales, has notified customers that &quot;cloud services are being phased out during Q4 2025,&quot; according to an email obtained by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806246/neato-robovac-cloud-shutdown" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The Verge</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While Neato&#39;s parent company Vorwerk Group initially said cloud support would continue for at least five years following its closure, the email now says &quot;cybersecurity standards, compliance obligations, and regulations have advanced in ways that make it no longer possible to safely and sustainably operate these legacy systems.&quot; This doesn&#39;t mean existing Neato products will be completely bricked — there&#39;s still the option to start them manually by pressing a button — but they won&#39;t offer all the smart home conveniences expected from a robovac that cost hundreds of dollars. Without use of the app, customers won&#39;t be able to set cleaning schedules, remotely start the vacuums or assign No-go zones.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/shuttered-robot-vacuum-maker-neato-is-ending-cloud-services-sooner-than-planned-171604823.html?src=rss
