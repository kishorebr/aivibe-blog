<p>Reddit is going to be leaning even harder into search in the coming months. The company has already been working on a plan to integrate its LLM-powered search into its main search feature, but CEO Steve Huffman said he wants users to think of the site as an actual search engine.</p>
<p>During the company&#39;s latest earnings call, Huffman said search is one of the top priorities for Reddit. &quot;We&#39;re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs, improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea of reddit as a search engine isn&#39;t that far-fetched. Many people are already in the habit of adding &quot;Reddit&quot; to traditional searches in the hopes of finding relevant threads from the site. And the company has been trying to take advantage of this with its own AI-powered search product <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-introduces-ai-powered-reddit-answers-search-feature-140028655.html"><ins>Reddit Answers</ins></a>. Though that feature is still labeled as being in &quot;beta,&quot; the company plans to eventually add it to its default search bar.</p>
<p>&quot;Our focus right now is on unifying the Reddit search, like traditional search on Reddit, which is very widely used on Reddit, and the new Reddit answers product ... we&#39;re unifying those into a single search experience, and we&#39;re going to bring that front and center in the app,&quot; Huffman said.</p>
<p>Huffman&#39;s comments come at a time when AI is increasingly <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/cloudflare-ceo-says-people-arent-checking-ai-chatbots-source-links-120016921.html"><ins>eating search traffic</ins></a> for websites. It sounds like even Reddit, which has a multimillion-dollar data licensing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-licensing-its-content-to-google-to-help-train-its-ai-models-200013007.html"><ins>deal with Google</ins></a>, isn&#39;t immune from those trends either. During the call, Huffman said that Reddit&#39;s search traffic from Google &quot;varies week to week,&quot; but that overall &quot;it was a headwind&quot; during the last quarter.</p>
<p>That may help explain why Huffman is so eager to make Reddit itself a search destination, even as the company continues to license its data to AI companies. &quot;AI doesn&#39;t invent knowledge,&quot; he said. &quot;It learns from us; from real people, sharing real perspectives.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-should-be-a-go-to-search-engine-steve-huffman-says-230039621.html?src=rss
