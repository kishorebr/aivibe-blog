<p>The US Department of Justice <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/uber-doj-lawsuit-disabilities-discrimination.html">sued</a> Uber on Thursday over disability discrimination… again. The lawsuit claims the company and its drivers &quot;routinely refuse to serve individuals with disabilities.&quot; It specifically calls out its handling of passengers with service animals or stowable wheelchairs. The suit was filed in federal court in Northern California.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the importance of its services to people with disabilities, Uber denies people with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of its services in several critical ways,&quot; the lawsuit reads. It also accuses Uber&#39;s drivers of insulting and demeaning people with disabilities and asking them inappropriate questions.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement sent to Engadget, Uber contested the government&#39;s claims. &quot;Riders who use guide dogs or other assistive devices deserve a safe, respectful, and welcoming experience on Uber — full stop,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;We have a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials, and we fundamentally disagree with the DOJ&#39;s allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>Uber said all drivers must acknowledge and agree to its service animal <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=service-animal-policy&amp;country=united-states&amp;lang=en">policy</a> before they can begin driving. &quot;When we confirm a violation, we take decisive action, including permanent account deactivation,&quot; the company wrote. Uber noted that its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/safety/uber-community-guidelines/">community guidelines</a> prohibit discrimination. It also added that it sent a service animal education video to all US drivers last year, explaining their vital role.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Uber added a feature that lets passengers alert drivers that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-wants-to-make-rides-easier-for-people-with-service-animals-210958456.html">they&#39;ll be traveling with service animals</a>. The DOJ&#39;s complaint says the company introduced the feature only after being notified of the investigation. &quot;But Uber has continued to discriminate against riders who use service animals notwithstanding the feature,&quot; the filing reads.</p>
<p>The DOJ is seeking a jury trial, injunctive relief and monetary damages. It also wants to charge Uber a civil fine for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, there&#39;s a good reason. The DOJ <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-uber-disability-lawsuit-214724043.html">sued Uber in 2021</a> over similar claims. That suit focused on &quot;wait time&quot; fees sent to passengers who, due to their disabilities, needed more time. The two sides settled the lawsuit in 2022. Uber <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rider-disability-lawsuit-settlement-212009968.html">agreed to pay at least $2.2 million to passengers</a> with disabilities who were charged waiting fees. The company has also faced <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-28-lawsuit-claims-uber-discriminates-disabilities.html">a string</a> of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-uber-lawsuit-disabled-accessibility-failure.html">lawsuits from passengers</a> over <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-18-uber-sued-again-failing-disabled-passengers.html">serving riders with disabilities</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-doj-sues-uber-again-for-allegedly-discriminating-against-people-with-disabilities-195442362.html?src=rss
