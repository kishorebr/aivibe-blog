<p>Workers from Blizzard Entertainment&#39;s department for Story and Franchise Development have <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union">voted</a> to unionize. Members of the team will become members of the Communication Workers of America and Microsoft has recognized the union. The SFD team is responsible for cinematics, animation and narrative in Blizzard&#39;s series, creating content such as in-game cutscenes and promotional videos. The department also includes archival workers and historians for Blizzard franchises, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. A spokesperson from CWA said that there will be about 169 workers from the company joining the local chapter.</p>
<p>&quot;After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I&#39;ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability&#39;s been fading,&quot; Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said. &quot;With a union, we&#39;re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>Blizzard is owned by Microsoft. Today&#39;s development marks the latest move for game developers under the tech giant&#39;s umbrella to pursue union representation. About 600 quality assurance workers from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activisions-union-with-600-members-is-now-the-biggest-one-in-video-games-143000869.html">Activision</a> joined CWA last March.
