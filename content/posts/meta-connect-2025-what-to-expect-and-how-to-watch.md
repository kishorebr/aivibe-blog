Meta Connect 2025 — the company’s biggest conference of the year where it unveils smart glasses and VR headsets — kicks off on Wednesday night. We’re expecting the star of Meta Connect 2025 to be the company’s new AI-powered smart glasses with Ray-Ban and Oakley, but the company may have some other surprises in store regarding the Metaverse, Quest headsets, or even its broader AI ambitions.

Meta says it has sold millions of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and earlier this year, Meta unveiled its latest AI-powered smart glasses with Oakley, which were designed for athletes. Silicon Valley is leaning heavily into AI wearables, and Meta seems to be one of the companies leading the charge.


	
	




	
	



Notably, this is the company’s first Connect conference since it started Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), its boldest effort yet to develop cutting-edge AI systems under former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. It’s possible we’ll get some official updates on how that project is going, and we may hear from some MSL executives.

As Meta looks to regain its footing in the AI race, this year’s Connect feels especially consequential. 

How to watch

Meta Connect 2025 starts at 5 p.m. PT Wednesday, with a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The event will take place in person at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park. You can register for free to watch the livestream virtually on Meta’s website. Meta’s agenda says the keynote will be roughly an hour.

If you want to get that Menlo Park feel from the comfort of your living room, you can also access the keynote through Horizon via your Meta Quest headset. You can also access the Meta Connect 2025 keynote on Facebook via the company’s official developer page, Meta for Developers.

On Thursday, Meta will host a Developer Keynote staring 10 a.m. PT to discuss the new experiences people can build with its devices. Then, at 10:45 a.m. PT, Meta will host a conversation between Chief Scientist of Reality Labs Michael Abrash and VP of Reality Lab
