Meta on Wednesday unveiled a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a built-in display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that picks up on subtle hand gestures, called Meta Neural Band, the same one it unveiled at last year’s Connect as part of its Orion demo.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the new product, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, onstage at the company’s annual developer conference, Meta Connect 2025. Unlike Orion, Zuckerberg says this is a product that people can buy in a couple of weeks, starting September 30, and they’ll cost $799.

With the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta aims to build off the success of its original Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which the company has sold millions of pairs of with its eyewear partner, EssilorLuxottica. Much like Ray-Ban Meta, the Meta Ray-Ban Display comes equipped with an on-board AI assistant, as well as cameras, speakers, and microphones. The glasses let users connect to the cloud to access the internet and social media apps.

The Neural Band that ships alongside the device looks similar to a Fitbit, but without a screen, and allows users to navigate apps with small hand movements. Zuckerberg said onstage that the Meta N
