<p>Remedy <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002">has announced plans to fix</a> <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> and restore the good will of consumers <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedy-is-trying-to-fix-fbc-firebreak-in-response-to-middling-reviews-and-player-feedback-203805921.html">after a rough launch earlier this year</a>. Many of the issues surrounding the launch were regarding the onboarding process, which the company acknowledges by saying that &quot;many players come into the game and leave within the first hour.&quot;</p>
<p>Remedy is trying to make that opening hour more welcoming to new players, so they don&#39;t &quot;feel ineffective and confused as to what to do.&quot; It has already placed an introductory video in the game with a narrative to explain the world and how it relates to the developer&#39;s hit game <em>Control</em>, as <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is set in the same universe. Remedy promises more of this type of &quot;narrative onboarding&quot; will come to the game later this year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s building a playable tutorial level, as the developer acknowledges it needs &quot;to do a better job&quot; teaching new players the core mechanics and features. It&#39;s also taking a page out of Nintendo&#39;s playbook and introducing more &quot;pop up&quot; tips that will appear at &quot;relevant times&quot; throughout the first couple of hours.</p>
<p>The forthcoming updates aren&#39;t just about onboarding. Remedy will be adding three new heavy guns to the arsenal and introducing a modding system for weapons. The company will share more about this system &quot;before September.&quot; It&#39;s also introducing &quot;big changes to the way&quot; players access missions and beefing up the missions themselves.</p>
<p>The developer says it&#39;s refining several elements to increase the fun factor, going on to say that it will be &quot;weeding out our least fun experience&quot; and &quot;focusing on our best experiences.&quot; There will even be new game modes and missions down the line.</p>

<p>Much of this is coming in the game&#39;s first major update, with a planned winter launch. For the uninitiated, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is a multiplayer FPS that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedys-new-game-is-fbc-firebreak-a-co-op-shooter-in-the-control-universe-180702570.html">places an emphasis on cooperative action</a>. It&#39;s available on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, so it could technically be &quot;free&quot; to check out any progress the dev has made since launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedy-lays-out-its-plan-to-fix-fbc-firebreak-which-includes-improved-onboarding-182301518.html?src=rss
