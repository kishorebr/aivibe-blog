<p>In the pursuit of actually releasing the updated version of Siri the company promised way back at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">WWDC 2024</a>, Apple is taking a page out of OpenAI&#39;s book.<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/apple-builds-a-chatgpt-like-app-to-help-test-the-revamped-siri"> According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has created a ChatGPT-inspired app to test Siri&#39;s new capabilities ahead of the release of the improved voice assistant next year.</p>
<p>This new app, called &quot;Veritas&quot; internally, will likely never make its way to the public in its current form, but offers Apple employees a faster way to test Siri&#39;s new skills. That includes letting users search through personal data stored on their phone, like their emails and messages, or taking action in apps, like editing photos. The new app is apparently also a way for Apple to &quot;gather feedback on whether the chatbot format has value,&quot; <em>Bloomberg</em> writes.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While an internal app doesn&#39;t make it any clearer how useful Apple&#39;s updated Siri will be, it does suggest the project is in a more advanced stage than before. Given the difficulty the company&#39;s faced actually releasing its various AI products — including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">publicly delaying the Siri update</a> back in March 2025 — that&#39;s meaningful.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s original promise for Apple Intelligence was that it could offer a curated selection of AI-powered features with a level of privacy and polish that its competitors couldn&#39;t muster. The reality is that Apple shipped a collection of so-so features that worked, but couldn&#39;t pull off its truly impressive demo: a Siri informed on the context of your life and with the ability to actually do things on your phone.</p>
<p>Apple is only realizing that vision in 2026, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports, through a combination of its own AI models, and at least one third-party model from its competitors. In June, the company was reportedly considering using a model from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-may-power-siri-with-anthropic-or-openai-models-amid-ai-struggles-212028351.html">either OpenAI or Anthropic</a>, but as of August, the company is now apparently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-considering-using-gemini-to-power-the-new-siri-184528449.html">circling a partnership with Google</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-made-a-chatgpt-clone-to-test-siris-new-capabilities-194902560.html?src=rss
