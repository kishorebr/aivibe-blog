<p>Apple may be releasing a new iPad Pro with an M5 chip in the very near future, according to an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzkC2q-iGI">unboxing video made by a Russian YouTuber</a>. This is the same creator that leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip last year, so the information in the video is likely credible.</p>
<p>To that end, the creator unboxes what appears to be a new 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in a Space Black finish. The exterior design doesn&#39;t look noticeably different from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">current models</a>, as the tablet still has a single rear camera, four speakers and a Smart Connector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previous leaks had indicated that the next iPad Pro <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">would feature a second front camera</a>, but this video doesn&#39;t confirm that. It also looks like this new model is still plenty thin.</p>
<p>The video even puts the tablet through some testing. A Geekbench 6 benchmark shows a 12 percent increase in multi-core CPU performance when compared to the previous generation. This benchmark result suggests a 36 percent faster GPU. It also indicated that the 256GB model of this tablet will include 12GB of RAM. Current models with 256GB of storage ship with just 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The footage shows that this tablet is running <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a>, which makes sense, and that the battery was manufactured in August of this year. This could all be a ruse but, again, the leaker has been proven correct in the past. It&#39;s likely that Apple will announce the refreshed iPad Pro with the M5 chip sometime in October, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-is-reportedly-on-track-to-launch-the-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-later-this-year-211013731.html">which tracks with previous reporting</a>.</p>
<p>It was also recently reported that the company is working on a refresh of the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-is-reportedly-nearing-production-for-its-latest-m5-powered-macbooks-154148070.html">MacBook Pro laptop with the M5 chip</a>. These computers could be available later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/it-looks-like-an-m5-ipad-pro-is-coming-very-soon-184406117.html?src=rss
