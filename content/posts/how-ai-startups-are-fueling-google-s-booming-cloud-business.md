Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers. Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as their primary cloud computing provider, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals AWS and Microsoft Azure.

The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future.


	
	




	
	



Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum.

Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023.

Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI, and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud.

While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition, spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment.

Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin.
