<p>The Need for Speed franchise could be making its last laps — at least for the time being. Matthew Everingham, a photographer who frequently contributed to car culture website <em>Speedhunters</em>, said in social media posts that Electronic Arts has "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL8zRnrTSwl/">shelved Need for Speed</a>" and is "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mattheweveringhamphotography/">quietly parking</a>" the series. <em>Speedhunters</em>, which was funded by EA and was last updated in April of this year, will also reportedly cease operations for now.</p>
<p>EA hasn't released an official statement on the fate of the Need for Speed franchise, but several internal decisions point to an uncertain future. Earlier this month, the publisher announced that it would shut down online servers for the cult classic <em>Need for Speed Rivals</em> on October 7. Before that, the developer behind Need for Speed, Criterion Games, shifted most of its employees to focus on the Battlefield franchise, leaving only a "core group" to continue working on the racing series in 2023. However, Battlefield head Vince Zampella told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now"><em>EuroGamer</em></a> earlier this year that the rest of that Need for Speed team would be "joining their colleagues working on Battlefield."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The longstanding franchise dates back to 1994 when the first title, <em>The Need for Speed</em>, was released on the original PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. Since then, the series pumped out more than 20 games, with the most recent being <em>Need for Speed Unbound. </em>Released in December 2022, the latest title in the franchise is currently sitting at a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846380/Need_for_Speed_Unbound/">Mixed rating</a> with more than 40,000 reviews on Steam.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-is-reportedly-hitting-the-brakes-on-the-need-for-speed-franchise-164807626.html?src=rss
