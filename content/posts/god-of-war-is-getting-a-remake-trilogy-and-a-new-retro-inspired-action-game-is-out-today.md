<p>Last year marked 20 years since <em>God of War</em> hit the PlayStation 2 and kicked off one of gaming biggest franchises. Now, at the tail end of that 20th anniversary celebration, Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has announced two new project. First, and most significantly, the original God of War trilogy from the PS2 and PS3 is being remade for the modern era. </p><p>There’s no footage of it yet — the developer says that they’re “very early in development,” so we likely won’t see or hear much about this for a while. But given renewed interest in God of War thanks to the excellent two Norse games from 2018 and 2022 (not to mention the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">upcoming Amazon series</a>), it makes sense to revisit these classics. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_tq12WisX8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>God of War</em> and <em>God of War II</em> were released for Playstation 2 in 2005 and 2007, respectively, while the third of the Greek trilogy hit PlayStation 3 in 2010. The third game was also remastered for the PS4. But it’s safe to say that while the first two games are classics for their era, they also really show their age in some gameplay spots. Hopefully the remake will smooth out those rough edges. (Who else has nightmares in the Hades level near the end of the first game? Not just me, right?)</p><p>While we won’t see the remakes for a while, there <em>is</em> a new God of War-inspired game out right now: <em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em>. It was developed by Mega Cat Studios, a developer known for its love of retro games — it even still releases games for the SNES and Genesis. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFhOo6NTt70?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Given their pedigree, it’s no surprise that <em>Sons of Sparta</em> has vibes of classic 2D action/platformer games. It’s apparently canon for the series and takes place in Kratos’ youth while he trains with his brother. It obviously looks nothing like the other God of War games — but the combat and monsters shown off in the trailer definitely feel right at home in the series. </p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of all this is that it’s available today for $30. While <em>Sons of Sparta</em> looks like a fun curio for God of War fans, it’ll only go so far towards whetting our appetite for that remake series.
