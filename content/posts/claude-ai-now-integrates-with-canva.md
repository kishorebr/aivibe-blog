<p>Anthropic's Claude can now create and edit designs with visual studio Canva from within an AI chat. This integration is powered by a Canva server that uses Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, or MCP. Claude can use Canvas's tools to generate a design or search for materials within a user's Canva workspace. This functionality requires a paid subscription to Claude, and access also varies based on the user's Canva plan.</p>
<p>Multiple artificial intelligence platforms have started using MCP to connect their models to applications. Anthropic <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol"><ins>unveiled</ins></a> its MCP in November, and earlier this month, it announced that Wiley and Panopto had created MCP servers to connect to Claude.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Anthropic now has a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.ai/directory__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!BAyf2JNpAE6Ur43Oj14Euxm7MMe4rwNgWNQJ1zPZo2rzkTPPz4ThVTaqQGO88pRu1LtjEwMiFQCbM-5VD4sEsg$"><ins>directory</ins></a> of all the platforms that use its MCP tech. From that directory, users can discover and access the remote services and local apps that connect to Claude. Subscriptions are required for the remote connectors. It seems likely that the company will continue to expand its roster of supported services and get its chatbot active in more third-party platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-ai-now-integrates-with-canva-201808571.html?src=rss
