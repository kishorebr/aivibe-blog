<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-14-mortal-kombat-x-the-comedy-of-violence.html">Violent video games</a> have found themselves in the crosshairs of politicians yet again, but this time with Mexico&#39;s government. Earlier this week, Mexico&#39;s Chamber of Deputies approved a comprehensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">financial package</a> that includes an eight percent tax on video games with mature content. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/mexico-moves-closer-to-putting-a-tax-on-violent-video-games/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, the proposed tax covers games that have a C or D rating under Mexico&#39;s video game age classification system, which is similar to ESRB in the US. The C rating is for players who are at least 18 years old and allows for extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content, while the D rating is reserved for adults only and allows for prolonged scenes that include similar content.</p>
<p>The proposed law was first introduced in September, when the country&#39;s Treasury Department claimed that &quot;recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.&quot; The report cited a study from 2012 in a footnote, which also observed some positive associations with video games, including motor learning and building resilience.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The current interpretation of the proposal that&#39;s been approved by the Chamber of Deputies would apply to digital and physical copies of affected games, as well as any in-game purchases or microtransactions. The proposal still has to go through Mexico&#39;s other congressional chamber, the Senate, where it will be debated before a November 15 deadline to submit a budget proposal.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mexico-is-considering-slapping-an-eight-percent-tax-on-violent-video-games-184101628.html?src=rss
