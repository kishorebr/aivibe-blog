<p>While it still remains more of a dream than an obvious stop on Apple’s product roadmap, the company’s updates in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">macOS Tahoe 26</a> offer new evidence that Apple could one day sell Macs with cellular connectivity. Sure, the biggest takeaway from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html">WWDC 2025</a> will probably be the new <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Liquid Glass</a> design language the company is sprinkling over all of its operating systems, but based on the addition of a Phone app to macOS, Apple’s laptops and phones are converging in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The new Phone app, which combines recent phone calls, favorite contacts and voicemails all in one interface, will offer the same features in both iOS and macOS. That’s a first for Apple’s desktop operating system, which has a FaceTime app, but otherwise primarily interacts with phone calls through <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=faf01c3d-ff88-474c-b1a8-2ba5debed141&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Continuity+features&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbWFjb3MvY29udGludWl0eS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZhZjAxYzNkLWZmODgtNDc0Yy1iMWE4LTJiYTVkZWJlZDE0MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL21hY29zL2NvbnRpbnVpdHkvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbz-ldfPquE7Jx7WQfETC1dJk6O7H6CkTZZzy1JNHIiV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fcontinuity%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity features</a>. Currently, iPhone calls can be relayed and answered on a Mac, and you can place calls from the FaceTime app, but it’s far from intuitive. That should change in macOS 26. The Phone app lets you make calls, listen to voicemails and even use new features like Hold Assist as easily as you would on an iPhone.</p>

<p>Every year Apple nudges its platforms together, like letting you access your iPhone from your desktop with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-mirror-your-iphone-on-macos-sequoia-130003743.html">iPhone Mirroring</a> or use your iPhone as a webcam with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-use-your-iphone-as-a-webcam-with-your-mac-164248242.html">Continuity Camera</a>. But porting apps directly from the iPhone feels like a more significant step. On iPad, which is sold in Wi-Fi and Cellular configurations, adding the Phone app (as Apple is with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a>) makes sense. The iPhone and iPad share a lot of similarities from both a software and hardware perspective. The Mac does not — at least, not yet.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman reported</a> that Apple was "investigating the idea of bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac." Apple has been trying to move away from relying on Qualcomm’s cellular modems for years. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-apple-buys-intel-smartphone-modem-business.html">bought Intel’s smartphone modem team</a> in pursuit of that idea in 2019, and debuted the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-announces-the-iphone-16e-with-apple-intelligence-for-599-161435140.html">iPhone 16e</a>, its first device with a custom Apple C1 modem, earlier this year. A cellular Mac seems like a perfect opportunity to put future versions of that modem, say a C2 or C3, to the test.</p>
<p>Even with better multitasking, there’s still plenty of tasks that are easier on a Mac than on an iPad. A cellular Mac could let you upload a professionally edited video out in the field, or communicate with your team without having to be tethered to a Wi-Fi hotspot. Both are possible on an iPad, but would feel more natural on a Mac.</p>
<p>Gurman suggests the company wouldn’t try to bring its custom modem to devices other than the iPhone until 2026 at the earliest, but Apple could be laying the groundwork from a software perspective right now. Macs already use Apple’s custom chips, and they’ll soon feature software that’s increasingly similar to the iPhone. All that's missing is a modem that can connect to cellular networks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-phone-app-in-macos-26-is-another-baby-step-towards-a-cellular-mac-220854738.html?src=rss
