<p>Amazon has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity that demands that the AI startup prevents its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-now-free-for-everyone-170017509.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Comet browser</a> from making purchases on Amazon, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/amazon-demands-perplexity-stop-ai-agent-from-making-purchases?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a blog post</a> responding to Amazon&#39;s letter, Perplexity claims Amazon is &quot;bullying&quot; the company and that its demands pose &quot;a threat to all internet users.&quot;</p><p>In Amazon&#39;s eyes, Comet&#39;s agent violates its terms of service, degrades the Amazon shopping experience and introduces privacy vulnerabilities, <em>Bloomberg</em> writes. Amazon&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=582a48d8-5ef0-42ba-88c5-d99dfa6c3ad1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=%22Conditions+of+Use%22&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL2hlbHAvY3VzdG9tZXIvZGlzcGxheS5odG1sLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ODJhNDhkOC01ZWYwLTQyYmEtODhjNS1kOTlkZmE2YzNhZDEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vZ3AvaGVscC9jdXN0b21lci9kaXNwbGF5Lmh0bWwvIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdXzR9LnoY6aCBqJ0rqaaIPtdp4SlYObK36aMkbVABr1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM">&quot;Conditions of Use&quot;</a> for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Amazon.com" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">Amazon.com</a> specifically prohibit &quot;any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party&quot; and &quot;any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools.&quot; Depending on your definition, the agentic capabilities Perplexity offers through Comet could violate both clauses. The browser securely stores log-in credentials for websites locally, and uses them to make purchases for customers on Amazon with a simple command.&nbsp;</p><p>Perplexity and Amazon agreed to pause agentic shopping on Amazon in November 2024, according to the report, but when Comet was released, Perplexity allowed it again. By representing the Comet agent as a Chrome browser user rather than a bot, the company allegedly tried to get around the agreement, until Amazon found out and sent its cease-and-desist letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon posted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-perplexity-comet-statement" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">the statement</a> below on its blog, openly acknowledging the issues it has with Perplexity: </p><blockquote><p>We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate. This helps ensure a positive customer experience and it is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers. Agentic third-party applications such as Perplexity’s Comet have the same obligations, and we’ve repeatedly requested that Perplexity remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.</p></blockquote><p>Complicating Amazon’s claims, Perplexity might be a future shopping rival. Amazon demoed its own AI shopping agent called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-buy-for-me-ai-will-purchase-stuff-from-third-party-websites-123036361.html" data-i13n="slk:&#x00201c;Buy for Me&#x00201d;;cpos:7;pos:1">“Buy for Me”</a> in April 2025. But Perplexity also disagrees with the fundamentals of Amazon&#39;s argument. &quot;User agents are exactly that: agents of the user,&quot; Perplexity says. &quot;They&#39;re distinct from crawlers, scrapers, or bots.&quot; Perplexity believes the Comet agent shouldn&#39;t run afoul of Amazon&#39;s terms and conditions then because it acts on the users&#39; behalf, with the users&#39; permission.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Perplexity has been accused of misrepresenting its AI tools to access content. In August, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-allegedly-scraping-websites-its-not-supposed-to-again-211110756.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Cloudflare claimed</a> that the company&#39;s bots were accessing blocked websites by pretending to be a normal Chrome browser user on macOS. Reddit <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-perplexity-and-three-other-companies-for-allegedly-using-its-content-without-paying-205136436.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">also sued Perplexity</a> and three other companies earlier this month for accessing Reddit posts without paying for a license.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-and-perplexity-are-fighting-over-the-future-of-ai-shopping-215445479.html?src=rss
