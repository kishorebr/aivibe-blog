<p>A Siri that does way more than just setting a timer or writing down a reminder may still be nearly a year away. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-10/apple-app-intents-voice-control-feature-for-siri-apps-ios-26-release-timing"><em>Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman</em></a>, Apple plans to release an overhauled version of Siri in the spring, which will be enhanced by the new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents">App Intents</a> feature. Gurman reported that the upgraded Siri will handle more complex tasks within apps, like commenting on an Instagram post, adding an item to your cart in a shopping app or editing a specific photo and sending it afterwards.</p>
<p>After a disappointing delay, Apple is playing catch-up to deliver on previous claims of an improved Siri. According to Gurman, the company is testing App Intents with its own apps, but also third-party apps, including AllTrails, Amazon, Facebook, Threads, Temu, Uber, WhatsApp and YouTube. For apps that handle more sensitive info, like banking apps, Gurman said that Apple may look into certain restrictions or completely avoid these apps for App Intents.</p>
