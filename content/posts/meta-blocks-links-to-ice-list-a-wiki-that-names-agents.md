<p>Meta has started blocking links to ICE List, a website that compiles information about incidents involving Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents, and lists thousands of their employees&#39; names. It seems that the latter detail is what caused Meta to take action in a move that was first <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-blocking-links-to-ice-list-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">reported by</a> <em>Wired</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>ICE List is a crowdsourced Wiki that describes itself as &quot;an independently maintained public documentation project focused on immigration-enforcement activity&quot; in the US. &quot;Its purpose is to record, organize, and preserve verifiable information about enforcement actions, agents, facilities, vehicles, and related incidents that would otherwise remain fragmented, difficult to access, or undocumented,&quot; its website states.</p><p>Along with notable incidents, the website also lists the names of individual agents associated with ICE, CBP and other DHS agencies. According to <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Wired</em></a>, the website&#39;s creators said much of that information had come from a &quot;leak,&quot; though it appears to be based largely on public LinkedIn profiles. As <em>Wired </em>notes:</p><blockquote><p>The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.</p></blockquote><p>Links to ICE List have been spreading widely for several weeks, including on Meta&#39;s platforms. There are numerous links to the website on Threads, some of which go back several weeks. Now though, clicking on previously-shared links instead results in a message that the link can&#39;t be opened. Users who try to share new links on Threads or Facebook also see error messages. &quot;Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can&#39;t be edited,&quot; the notice says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to the company&#39;s privacy policy barring the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The company didn&#39;t address why it chose to start blocking the website after several weeks, or whether it considers public LinkedIn profiles to be in violation of its rules against doxxing. </p><p>It is, however, not the first time Meta has opted to remove users&#39; posts tracking information about ICE actions. The social network previously took down a Facebook group that <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/technology/meta-removes-ice-facebook-page.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">tracked ICE sightings</a> in Chicago <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-removes-facebook-group-for-tracking-ice-agents-after-doj-pressure-203429574.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">after pressure</a> from the Justice Department. </p><p><em>Have a tip for Karissa?
