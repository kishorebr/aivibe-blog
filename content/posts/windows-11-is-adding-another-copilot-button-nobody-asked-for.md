<p class="has-text-align-none">Have enough <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs">Copilot buttons</a> in your life? No you don’t — have another one! This one pops up in the latest <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/09/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6690-dev-channel/">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a> when mousing over an open app in your taskbar; it lets you share the contents with Copilot Vision. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Want to know who is celebrating in that dogpile on the mound, or dig a little deeper on that sculpture you took a photo of? Just click that “Share with Copilot” button that pops up in the window preview. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645666/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-beta-testing">Copilot Vision</a> scans what&#8217;s on your screen, analyzes it, and lets you discuss the contents of the window with Microsoft’s AI chatbot to get more context, including offering tutorials. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it doesn’t exactly seem like Windows users are clamoring for <em>more </em>Copilot in their lives. There’s already buttons popping up in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604509/microsoft-paint-copilot-button">Microsoft Paint</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780322/microsoft-notepad-ai-features-free">Notepad</a>, in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318241/microsoft-copilot-native-app-quick-view-windows-10-11">taskbar</a>, on your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250067/microsoft-windows-11-copilot-key-customization-apps">keyboard</a>, and right <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235910/asus-nuc-14-pro-ai-copilot-button-mini-pc">on the front of some PCs</a>. There’s even another, more useful Copilot feature in the same Windows 11 preview that translates on-screen text. Microsoft does say it’s just “trying out this taskbar capability”, so don’t be shocked if it gets axed in an upcoming build before it actually ships to regular users.</p>
