<p>LG will present a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/12/lg-to-unveil-home-robot-at-ces-2026-sharing-vision-for-the-zero-labor-home/"><ins>home robot</ins></a> named CLOiD at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a> in Las Vegas. With humanoid robotics sure to feature heavily at this year&#39;s tech conference, LG has teased its home assistant before a full unveiling in January.</p>
<p>The company says CLOiD&#39;s two articulated arms with five individually actuated fingers are designed to help with a variety of household tasks. However, LG has not yet given a specific example of a task CLOiD can handle. We&#39;re also not sure what it looks like, because aside from a couple of very close-up images of CLOiD&#39;s hands, LG is keeping what the robot looks like under wraps until the show.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG said CLOiD is part of the company&#39;s vision that “Zero Labor Home, Makes Quality Time.” It said its robot is a step toward a company goal of &quot;freeing customers from the time-consuming demands of housework.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLOiD&#39;s chipset is housed in its head, which also sports a display, speaker, camera and a bevy of sensors meant to enable expressive communication. LG says its new robot is powered by its &quot;Affectionate Intelligence&quot; technology and is designed to interact in a neutral, user-friendly way. It&#39;s also designed to refine its responses through repeated interactions with a user.</p>
<p>CES often plays host to proof-of-concept products that offer a window into the future but may <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html"><ins>not make it to market</ins></a>. It remains to be seen if CLOiD is simply a booth-side attention-getter or something with real potential. Visitors can see CLOiD handle some real-life scenarios at LG&#39;s booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html?src=rss
