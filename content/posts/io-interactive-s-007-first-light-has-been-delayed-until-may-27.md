<p>IO Interactive&#39;s James Bond simulator <em>007 First Light</em> has been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016">delayed until May 27, 2026</a>. It was supposed to come out in March. The company says two-month delay is for polish and refinement, which is fine by me. I&#39;d always rather wait a bit longer for a better end product.</p>
<p>IO says the game is already &quot;fully playable from beginning to end&quot; but still needs a bit of attention to ensure &quot;the strongest possible version at launch.&quot; The developer promises to share more updates at the beginning of next year.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the uninitiated, <em>007 First Light</em> is the first James Bond game <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-hitman-meets-action-movie-183551755.html">in over a decade</a>. The developer is the same organization behind the renowned Hitman franchise, so this could potentially be the best Bond game since <em>Goldeneye</em>.</p>

<p>The gameplay looks fast-paced, frenetic and filled with spycraft. It features an original story that pulls from all over the decades-long franchise. We got a chance to speak to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html">narrative director Martin Emborg</a> and he noted that the game stars a young and inexperienced Bond, which seems to be the direction Amazon is taking <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/new-james-bond-will-be-very-young-as-amazon-reportedly-plans-retro-reboot-3851305">with its upcoming film</a>.</p>
<p>The game also boasts a pretty stacked cast. Patrick Gibson, from <em>The OA</em> and <em>Dexter: Original Sin</em>, plays the famous lothario spy and Lenny Kravitz has been cast as the primary villain. Other cast members include Lennie James, Kiera Lester, Alastair Mackenzie and Priyanga Burford.</p>

<p>Who knows when the next Bond film will actually come out, so this should be a nice little stopgap for fans.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-has-been-delayed-until-may-27-194809718.html?src=rss
