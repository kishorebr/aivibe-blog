It&#39;s hard not to compare the Kodak Charmera to the ubiquitous Labubu craze, considering the highly collectible nature of Reto Pro selling these officially licensed mini cameras as a single blind box for $29.99 or a full set of six for $179.94. The keyring cameras, which only weigh 30 grams, are already sold out on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kodak.retopro.co/products/kodak-charmera-br-keychain-digital-camera-blind-box">Reto Pro website</a>, but are expected to be restocked.</p>
<p>The blind box can be unwrapped for one of seven designs, including one secret version that has a transparent shell to show off the tiny camera&#39;s internals. According to the website, the basic style odds are one out of six, while the secret edition has a probability of one out of 48. Whichever design you get, each Charmera comes with a keyring to Labubu-bify it to your belt loop or bag and a USB-C cable to export your photos or videos to other devices.</p>

Nobody should expect any ultrasharp images, but you can customize your shots with Kodak frames, vintage filters and a date stamp. We&#39;re not expecting the Charmera to deliver the highest-quality images, but just like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/this-nifty-fan-made-game-boy-camera-is-the-size-of-a-cartridge-185209536.html">Gameboy Camera</a>, that won&#39;t make it any less fun to use.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/kodaks-mini-camera-fits-on-your-keyring-and-is-smaller-than-an-airpods-case-184227505.html?src=rss
