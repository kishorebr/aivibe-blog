<p>Here&#39;s some good news for the &quot;Han shot first&quot; crowd. The original cut of <em>Star Wars</em> (1977), the film known today as <em>A New Hope</em>, is coming back to theaters. We first learned in August that <em>some</em> version of the film would be screened again in 2027 for its 50th anniversary. But we know now this will indeed be the version everyone saw before George Lucas made those questionable, CGI-heavy changes in the 1997 Special Editions. The re-release arrives in theaters on February 19, 2027.</p><p>In a short <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">update</a> posted Friday on the official Star Wars website, Lucasfilm all but clarified that this will be the original cut. It described it as &quot;a newly restored version of the classic Star Wars (1977) theatrical release.&quot; <em>Gizmodo</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-original-version-rerelease-2000696337" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a> that it received further clarification that this will indeed be the OG one, before those &quot;improvements” in the Special Edition (and subsequent re-releases).</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/star_wars.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/star_wars.jpg" style="height:1439px;width:2560px;" alt="Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a scene from Star Wars: A New Hope." data-uuid="5ff0ff88-99a6-4f2c-9145-d64c4a32088c"/><figcaption>Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a scene from Star Wars: A New Hope.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Plus</div></figure><p>Those mid-&#39;90s edits included early CGI effects that essentially served as a testing ground before Lucas moved on to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-guess-i-learned-how-to-appreciate-the-phantom-menace-173010855.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the Prequel Trilogy</a>. It also added a CG Jabba the Hutt / Han Solo scene (originally shot with actor Thomas Declan Mulholland as Jabba) that was cut from the original version.</p><p>Perhaps most infamously, Lucas made Greedo shoot first at Han in the canteen scene. Hardcore fans hated the change. It smoothed some of the rough edges of Han&#39;s start. It gave him a shorter, less dramatic journey into the reluctant hero he grew into as the story progressed. It&#39;s as if Lucas was signaling, &quot;Okay, Han may have started as kind of a jerk, but he wouldn&#39;t shoot a bounty hunter in cold blood! Think of the children watching!&quot;</p><p>But in my view, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> had the worst changes in 1997 and later. Although I didn&#39;t mind the new celebration music and location montage at the end (others disagree), it also added that cringey and out-of-place musical number in Jabba&#39;s palace. But I despised the change Lucas made for the film’s 2011 Blu-ray release: Darth Vader&#39;s overly telegraphed &quot;Nooooooo…&quot; as he makes the climactic decision to chuck the Emperor into the Death Star&#39;s reactor shaft. C’mon, George: It’s so more powerful for the audience to project Vader’s thought process onto his silent helmet. But if Disney sticks with the 50th Anniversary scheme, we&#39;ll have to wait until 2033 to see the untainted version of that movie in theaters again.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/the-1977-cut-of-star-wars-will-return-to-theaters-in-2027-221113091.html?src=rss
