<p>Amazon has officially <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-2025-date">announced</a> the dates for its next annual shopping event, and there’s a twist this year. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ecdf0fab-18b6-4fdb-b775-d0d620fee4ab&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Prime+Day+2025&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3ByaW1lZGF5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVjZGYwZmFiLTE4YjYtNGZkYi1iNzc1LWQwZDYyMGZlZTRhYiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9wcmltZWRheSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAepDUR_yg2AQvMSgVjLL3ZTb6WQINyC4TTk5XxdQ1kgF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fprimeday" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/primeday">Prime Day 2025</a> will be four days long, running from July 8 through July 11. A departure from previous years in which Prime Day was a 48-hour affair, this year the shopping event will span nearly an entire week, bringing thousands of exclusive, Prime-only deals on everything from electronics to fashion.</p>
<p>In addition to spurring a large number of sales in a short period of time, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> has always been a way for the online retail giant to increase the overall number of Prime subscribers. Prime Day isn’t necessarily a perk of the $139-per-year service like access to Prime Video content or free two-day shipping are, but it certainly helps that most deals you’ll find on Amazon during the event are exclusively available to Prime members.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the event being four days long this year, we expect to see some one-day-only deals as well as sales that span the entirety of Prime Day(s) proper. We usually recommend buying things on your list as soon as you see them go on sale just to avoid the disappointment that comes with items selling out, and this time is no different. That's especially true for deals that as listed as "limited time," or any Lightning Deals that only last a few hours.</p>
<p>Prime Day in July has been the main shopping event for Amazon for a decade now, but that hasn’t stopped the company from expanding the event’s reach. “October Prime Day” has become a mainstay in the fall, and Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is a relatively new shopping event that has taken place in March over the past couple of years. No word yet on if October Prime Day 2025 will be a thing, but we believe it’s almost guaranteed at this point.</p>
<p>If you do plan on putting that Prime membership to use next month, you can turn to Engadget to find the tech deals worth your month during the two-day event. Unsurprisingly, Amazon Prime Day is one of the best times of the year to get Amazon devices, since most of them will likely be down to all-time-low prices. But we also expect to see worthwhile sales on headphones, robot vacuums, laptops, SSDs and much more.
