Within five years, it could be tens or hundreds of agents. They will not only make decisions about what to do (based on their autonomous observations), but they will connect to multiple sources of data (as well as each other) in order to optimize those decisions and other outcomes.This future should terrify most organizations that already go to great lengths to protect their digital resources from unauthorized access. As employees are pressured to do more with the help of AI, they'll look to launch these agents and grant them access to whatever corporate resources are necessary. Today's credential for such user-provisioned application-to-application access -- known as an OAuth token -- may be woefully unsuited to the task.Also: Weaponized AI risk is 'high,' warns OpenAI - here's the plan to stop itSeveral years ago, well before agentic AI was on the horizon,
