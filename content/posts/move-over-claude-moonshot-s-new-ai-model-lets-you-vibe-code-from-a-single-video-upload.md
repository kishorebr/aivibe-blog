    Move over, Claude: Moonshot's new AI model lets you vibe-code from a single video upload
     
    While it's not yet clear how practically useful the capability will be for individuals and businesses, the model's "coding with vision" capability makes vibe coding even vibier.

Kimi K2.5 scored comparably to frontier models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic on the SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Multilingual coding benchmarks, according to data published by Moonshot.
