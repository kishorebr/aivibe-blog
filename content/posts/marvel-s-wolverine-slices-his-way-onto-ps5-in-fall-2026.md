<p>The rumors of <em>Marvel&#39;s Wolverine </em>showing up during Sony&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/a-playstation-state-of-play-is-set-for-september-24-143526268.html">September State of Play</a> turned out to be true after all. The trailer was our first decent look (well, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/insomniac-games-hackers-leak-13-million-files-after-demanding-2-million-ransom-102134429.html">first official one, anyway</a>) at the game since it was announced <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wolverine-game-ps5-insomniac-210950491.html">back in 2021</a>. Sony and Insomniac Games revealed a release window too: <em>Marvel&#39;s Wolverine </em>is coming to PS5 in fall 2026.</p>
<p>A gruff-sounding Liam McIntyre (<em>Spartacus: Vengeance</em>, JD Fenix in <em>Gears of War 4 </em>and <em>Gears 5</em>) is taking on the mantle of Logan here. As creative director Marcus Smith reminded us, Logan is an unreliable narrator with a patchy memory, which should make for an interesting wrinkle as the story plays out.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike in Insomniac&#39;s Spider-Man games, bad guys aren&#39;t going to be magically webbed to the side of a tall building after you kick them off the roof. Oh, no no. Wolverine rips an enemy apart in fury with his adamantium claws within the first 30 seconds of this trailer. Not long after, he thrusts them upwards through a goon&#39;s skull. We see him slicing off limbs too. Yeah, this isn&#39;t going to be a game for younger kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wolverine will encounter some familiar faces on his travels, including Mystique and Omega Red. And that&#39;s not to mention a certain giant robot that shows up at the end of the trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We aim to deliver the ultimate Wolverine fantasy built on Insomniac staples like fast, fluid, and ferocious combat; exhilarating, action-packed set pieces; robust accessibility features; and a gripping story that taps into the core tenets of one of the most compelling comic book characters of all time,&quot; Insomniac senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza wrote on the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-arrives-on-playstation-5-fall-2026/"><em>PlayStation Blog</em></a>. &quot;We’re breaking new ground with <em>Wolverine</em>, yes, but our penchant for telling stories about heroes overcoming colossal odds is as strong as ever. We’re eager to explore Logan’s story with you and tap into his signature spin on heroism, which is much darker and more brutal than you might expect from Insomniac.&quot;</p>
<p>Although we&#39;re a year or so away from <em>Marvel&#39;s Wolverine</em> coming to PS5 and PS5 Pro, we won&#39;t have to wait quite that long for more details. Insomniac promises to reveal additional info in spring 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/marvels-wolverine-slices-his-way-onto-ps5-in-fall-2026-220250305.html?src=rss
