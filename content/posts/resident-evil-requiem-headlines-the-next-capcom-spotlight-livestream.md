<p>Summer Game Fest might be in the rear-view mirror, but the gaming showcases are still coming. Capcom has announced that its next <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/spotlight/en-uk/"><ins>Spotlight</ins></a> livestream will take place on June 26. Planned to last around 40 minutes, the showcase will focus on upcoming titles <em>Pragmata </em>and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which was announced during <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-schedule-announcements-new-games-and-everything-else-to-expect-183538568.html"><ins>Summer Game Fest</ins></a> proper earlier this month. As well as news, the event will include developer interviews.</p>
<p>Capcom is also promoting <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em> as featured games, so expect new information on updates or fresh content for those existing titles in the showcase. We already know that the Title 2 Update for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is due at the end of the month, which will add new monsters and a new seasonal event.</p>

<p>The last Capcom Spotlight took place in February, where Capcom announced the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>. We wouldn’t expect any new game announcements this time, but it could happen. More exciting is the possibility of new footage of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which was arguably the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-demo-first--and-third-person-views-sgf-2025-150009510.html"><ins>biggest announcement</ins></a> of SGF 2025. We know we’ll be playing as a new character, named Grace Ashcroft, and that you’ll be able to choose between a first and third-person perspective throughout the game.</p>
<p>Engadget’s Mat Smith got to play <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pragmata-hands-on-demo-sgf-2025-150005007.html"><em><ins>Pragmata</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>at SGF, where he called it a “satisfying sci-fi shooter” and came away impressed by the elegance of its dual-protagonist gameplay. Capcom first announced the game way back in 2020, so it’s a long time coming.</p>
<p>The next Capcom Spotlight livestream will kick off on June 26 at 6pm ET.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-headlines-the-next-capcom-spotlight-livestream-143001469.html?src=rss
