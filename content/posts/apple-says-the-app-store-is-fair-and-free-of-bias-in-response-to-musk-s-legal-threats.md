<p>Apple has denied <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-feels-apple-favors-openai-over-xai-in-app-store-rankings-123034234.html">Elon Musk&#39;s accusation</a> that it&#39;s favoring OpenAI in its App Store rankings and making it impossible for other AI companies to reach the top. In a statement sent to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/musk-accuses-apple-of-unfairly-favoring-openai-among-iphone-apps"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Apple said the App Store is &quot;designed to be fair and free of bias.&quot; The company&#39;s spokesperson explained that the App Store features &quot;thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.&quot; They added: &quot;Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.&quot;</p>
<p>xAI founder Elon Musk accused Apple of &quot;unequivocal antitrust violation&quot; by favoring OpenAI in a post on X, warning that his company &quot;will take immediate legal action.&quot; In a separate post from his threat, he asked Apple why it &quot;[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] &#39;Must Have&#39; section.&quot; X, he said, is &quot;the #1 news app in the world,&quot; while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. &quot;Are you playing politics? What gives?&quot; he continued.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk didn&#39;t provide evidence to back his accusations. It&#39;s also worth noting that Chinese AI app DeepSeek <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chinas-deepseek-ai-assistant-becomes-top-free-iphone-app-as-us-tech-stocks-take-a-hit-134445151.html">reached the top of Apple&#39;s free app rankings</a> back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT. As X&#39;s own Community Notes also mentioned in Musk&#39;s post, added hours after it went up, Perplexity reached the top of overall rankings in India&#39;s App Store back in July. Both apps were able to reach the top of their respective lists way after Apple and OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-seems-to-have-persuaded-openai-to-work-for-exposure-033636236.html">announced their partnership</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk&#39;s accusation, as well. He said it&#39;s a &quot;remarkable claim,&quot; given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates &quot;X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn&#39;t like.&quot; In response, Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955299075781431726">posted</a>: &quot;Scam Altman lies as easily as he breathes.&quot;</p>
