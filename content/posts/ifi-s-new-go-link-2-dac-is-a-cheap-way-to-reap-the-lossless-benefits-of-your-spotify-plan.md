<p>Audio company iFi just introduced a new DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) that&#39;s both smaller and lighter than its previous model, and only costs $59. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ifi-audio.com/products/go-link-2" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">iFi GO Link 2</a> connects to a smartphone or other audio-playing device over USB-C and can instantly improve the listening experience on wired headphones.</p><p>Wireless earbuds and music streaming services have normalized listening to your favorite songs at a lower quality. For anyone who doesn&#39;t consider themselves an audiophile, that might not matter, but now that several streaming services offer higher sample rates and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-lossless-streaming-is-finally-here-and-its-included-with-a-premium-plan-131009528.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">lossless audio</a>, you might consider other ways of listening. In order to experience all the benefits of high-res or lossless audio, you need wired headphones, something that&#39;s increasingly difficult when most smartphones only have a USB-C port. That&#39;s where the iFi GO Link 2 comes in. The dongle plugs into a USB-C port and lets you connect a pair of wired earbuds while preserving your high quality audio at the same time.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ifi-go-link-2-product-image.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ifi-go-link-2-product-image.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="An iFi GO Link 2 DAC laid flat on a white background." data-uuid="dd0484f2-8ed3-4a67-8733-386bfe194830"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">iFi</div></figure><p>iFi&#39;s new DAC is eight percent smaller than the previous GO Link and 29 percent lighter, approaching the size of <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mw2q3am/a/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter?fnode=5038a1d833e1392b14fe4f3831dcb8fc8a211c4c2129cf463dd635dd9b97960424f6aeb461b6a79a8925c7633a9e67f70364aecd366b50eacabb7cb33171da1f383aba7ef90f0a5deb531487b348744d1ac0b8daa8b42009412340b1477f9329" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">Apple&#39;s USB-C to 3.5mm Headphone Jack dongle</a>. The GO Link 2&#39;s built-in ESS Sabre DAC chipset is supposed to add &quot;6dB of dynamic range between the loudest and quietest moments&quot; and reduce distortion for clearer sound by up to 62 percent when compared to the original GO Link.</p><p>Via iFi&#39;s companion Nexis app on Android, the GO Link 2 can also be updated on the go and further customized with digital filters. The GO Link 2 supports two digital filters — one hybrid and one linear — so that you can adjust things to your preferred sound profile. You can also use the Nexis app to set volume limits when you&#39;re listening with the DAC attached.</p><p>The previous GO Link made it on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Engadget&#39;s list of the best DACs for Apple Music Lossless</a>, and at the same price, the GO Link 2 seems like it could, too.
