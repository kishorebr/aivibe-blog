<p>Apple plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the US, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-increases-us-commitment-to-600-billion-usd-announces-ambitious-program/">the company announced</a> on Wednesday. The investment follows President Donald&#39;s Trump&#39;s previously announced plans to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/">raise tariffs on India</a> by an additional 25 percent (bringing the total tariff to 50 percent) for purchasing oil from Russia. Apple <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-may-shift-all-us-bound-iphone-production-from-china-to-india-133049630.html">relies heavily</a> on manufacturers in India to create the iPhone, so adding to its already <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-plans-to-invest-500-billion-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years-181217017.html">$500 billion investment in the US</a> is likely a way to avoid being impacted by the tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, we&#39;re proud to increase our investments across the United States to $600 billion over four years and launch our new American Manufacturing Program,&quot; Apple CEO Tim Cook shared in a statement. &quot;This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we’re grateful to the President for his support.&quot;</p>

<p>In February, Apple said its original $500 billion investment plan would go towards building Apple Intelligence servers in the US, and that the majority of the new jobs the funding would provide would be focused on R&amp;D, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning. As part of this additional investment, Apple says it&#39;s also deepening its relationship and investment in component makers working in the US, like Corning and Amkor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corning produces the glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, and the company says that &quot;soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass.&quot; Apple is investing in Amkor to take advantage of the company&#39;s &quot;advanced chip packaging and test facility in Arizona.&quot; Apple says its &quot;leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain in the United States&quot; through its investments.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-06/trump-apple-to-announce-fresh-100-billion-in-us-manufacturing?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> before the announcement, a White House spokesperson suggested the new investment would &quot;help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security.&quot; The Trump administration has previously called for Apple to make the iPhone in the US, something <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/tech/apple-iphone-trump-america-china"><em>CNN </em>reports</a> is difficult to downright impossible.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s current strategy for dealing with Trump is similar to how it handled the President during his first term. In 2019, Apple CEO Time Cook and Trump <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-20-trump-mac-pro-plant.html">&quot;opened&quot; a Mac Pro factory in Texas</a>. The factory had been up-and-running since 2013, but the President was pleased by the optics of making a deal. Apple&#39;s partnership with Amkor was similarly announced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-announces-expanded-partnership-with-amkor-for-silicon-packaging/">years ago in 2023</a>, but is being trotted out now because it fits with Apple&#39;s &quot;American Manufacturing Program.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple is a trillion-dollar company that can afford to spend a few billion to avoid paying tariffs, but it also likely planned to increase its investment in the US anyway to keep up with competitors. It&#39;s entirely possible the company is just packaging its spending in a way that flatters the President.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html?src=rss
