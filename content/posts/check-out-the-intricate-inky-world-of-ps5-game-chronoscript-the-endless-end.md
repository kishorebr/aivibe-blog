<p>One of the surprise announcements during Sony&#39;s State of Play presentation today was the debut of a literary-themed game titled <em>Chronoscript: The Endless End</em>. It&#39;s an action-adventure game with a very cool hand-drawn art aesthetic. Players will navigate the 3-dimensional world of a mysterious manor as well as the 2-dimensional world of illustrated manuscript pages.</p>
<p>The trailer mostly focused on those 2D sections, showing combat and platforming and seriously did I mention the very cool hand-drawn art? I would have been interested in this for the visuals alone, but throw in a story about writers and editors and I&#39;m hooked.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Perhaps fittingly for this writerly endeavor, the game&#39;s publisher is Shueisha, which is a heavyweight in publishing manga, including the popular <em>Shonen Jump</em>. The developer is DeskWorks, and the studio&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1839510/RPG_Time_The_Legend_of_Wright/"><ins>last project</ins></a> also boasted a lovely, illustrative style. We&#39;ll have a little longer to wait before we can dive into the inky world of <em>Chronoscript</em>, however, because this game isn&#39;t expected to arrive on the PlayStation 5 until some time in 2026.</p>
