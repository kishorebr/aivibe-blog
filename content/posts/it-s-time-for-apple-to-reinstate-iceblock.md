<p>In October, Apple caved to pressure from the Trump administration and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-removes-iceblock-from-the-app-store-after-trump-administrations-demand-031659651.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">removed ICEBlock — and similar apps which crowdsourced the location of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement activity — from its App Store</a>. Apple's stated rationale? The apps could "be used to harm law enforcement officers."  But armed-to-the-teeth ICE officers don’t need protection from civilians. Apple had that exactly backward.</p><p>That became impossible to ignore on Wednesday, when ICE agent Jonathon Ross <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=db1c945f-64db-4519-9c58-c6c65586ef02&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=killed&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzA3L3VzL2ljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1taW5uZWFwb2xpcy1yZW5lZS1nb29kLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRiMWM5NDVmLTY0ZGItNDUxOS05YzU4LWM2YzY1NTg2ZWYwMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyNi8wMS8wNy91cy9pY2Utc2hvb3RpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtcmVuZWUtZ29vZC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAX4j38laveEjbjKFA5Z4CAINEXJJMJbcSBI1yOp3Ztc_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fus%2Fice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/07/us/ice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good.html">killed</a> 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in cold blood. By now, you don't need me to recount her brutal last moments. But the footage (graphic and disturbing as it is) is out there, and we can see the Trump administration's propaganda about the event for what it is.</p><p>ICE was a dangerous force long before this week.

Around a third of those arrested by ICE agents — often masked and refusing to identify themselves — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/nx-s1-5637397/about-a-third-of-people-arrested-by-ice-had-no-criminal-record-new-data-shows" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">don’t even have criminal records.</a> </p><p>What changed this week was, arguably, that the victim wasn’t a brown-skinned person. ICE claimed the life of a white American citizen, one who, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/09/renee-goods-wife-releases-statement-about-ice-shooting" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">according</a> to her wife, was a kind, loving mom and a Christian. Unfortunately, the US has a dark history of shrugging off violence as long as it’s directed towards a marginalized group. That wasn’t possible for mainstream newsreaders here.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/79a4bba4-687c-4037-af9b-16c4e5b63136" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/79a4bba4-687c-4037-af9b-16c4e5b63136" style="height:5464px;width:8192px;" alt="LOS ANGELES,  CA &nbsp;- JANUARY 8, 2026  Dozens, holding photos of Renee Nicole Good, protest her death a day after an ICE agent killed Good in Minneapolis, in front of the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles on January 8, 2026.

Its keynotes are replete with heartfelt testimony of iPhone and Apple Watch features saving lives.

For example, when government regulations push for openness or interoperability, Apple <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-and-meta-are-beefing-over-the-dmas-mandated-interoperability-requests-155851120.html" data-i13n="slk:warns of the security and privacy risks for its users;cpos:13;pos:1">warns of the security and privacy risks for its users</a>. When Apple tightly controls where you can buy apps, it’s about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html" data-i13n="slk:keeping porn away from the kids;cpos:14;pos:1">keeping porn away from the kids</a>. And Apple has decided the theoretical safety of ICE officers is more valuable than the very real threat they pose to the communities they harass.</p><p>ICEBlock's availability on the App Store may not have changed the outcome of Wednesday's events. But it could resume its job as a community informer. It could make it easier to notify the public of where these masked thugs are congregating, perhaps even helping others avoid Good's fate.</p><p>Engadget has reached out to Apple for comment on reinstating ICEBlock; we’ll update if we receive a response.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/its-time-for-apple-to-reinstate-iceblock-220802356.html?src=rss
