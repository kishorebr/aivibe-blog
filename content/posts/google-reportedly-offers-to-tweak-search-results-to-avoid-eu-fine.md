<p>In order to avoid paying billions of dollars in fines for violating the European Union&#39;s Digital Markets Act, Google is considering changing how search results are displayed, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-offers-tweak-search-results-eu-antitrust-fine-looms-2025-10-14/"><em>Reuters </em>reports</a>. EU regulators <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eus-new-charges-against-google-could-lead-to-at-least-35-billion-in-fines-165850585.html">first took issue</a> with Google&#39;s Search and Play Store businesses in March 2025, claiming it favored its own services in search results over third-party options and prevented developers from informing customers of alternative ways of accessing apps.</p>
<p>One of regulators main issues with Google Search was that Google appeared to favor results from services like Google Flights or Google Hotels over ones from &quot;vertical search services,&quot; providers that specialize in displaying search results from a specific industry, like Expedia or Hotels.com. To avoid fines, Google now wants Search to give VSS businesses equal treatment in results.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We will create the opportunity for each VSS to show its own box on Search. A VSS box will be populated with results from that VSS inventory,&quot; Google said in a proposal viewed by <em>Reuters</em>. Results from Google&#39;s own services will exist with the same formatting alongside, and the winning VSS box will be displayed in search results based on &quot;objective and non-discriminatory criteria.&quot; Importantly, search results from actual airlines and car rental companies won&#39;t be excluded, they&#39;ll also appear in a box &quot;above or below the VSS box depending on the relevance to the user&#39;s query.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget has asked Google to comment on <em>Reuters</em>&#39;<em>&nbsp;</em>report and to confirm the details of its proposed changes to Google Search. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Google faces significant scrutiny from the EU because of its monopolistic control over its various platforms and services. The threat of fines from the DMA has forced Apple to open up its products to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html">third-party app stores</a>, among a host of other changes. Clearly, Google is willing to tweak what once seemed like untouchable pillars of its business to avoid fines, too. Whether these proposed changes will be enough for the regulators remains to be seen, though.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-reportedly-offers-to-tweak-search-results-to-avoid-eu-fine-193940005.html?src=rss
