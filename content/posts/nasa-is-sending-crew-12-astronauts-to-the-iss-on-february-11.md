<p>The Crew-12 astronauts will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-sets-coverage-for-agencys-spacex-crew-12-launch-docking/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">soon make their way</a> to the ISS, joining the three remaining spacefarers on board after the previous mission was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">cut short</a> due to a medical concern. NASA was originally planning a February 15 launch date for the mission, but it has moved it up to February 11. It’s now targeting a liftoff of no earlier than 6:01 AM Eastern that day from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The crew members are already in quarantine, and if everything goes well on launch day, the Dragon capsule they’re on will dock with the orbiting lab at approximately 10:30 AM on February 12. </p><p>If you’ll recall, NASA decided to bring Crew-11  members back home on January 15, a month earlier than planned, citing a medical concern with one of the members. While the affected astronaut was stable, the ISS didn’t have the equipment necessary to be able to diagnose them properly. All four members of Crew-11 <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/iss-mission-splashes-down-after-medical-issue-103000302.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">flew home</a>, leaving the whole space station in the hands of three people, namely NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two cosmonauts for the Russian side. They will be joined by Crew-12’s NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency’s Sophie Adenot and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev. </p><p>SpaceX recently had to ground its Falcon 9 rocket after an issue with its upper stage for a few days, leaving the Crew-12’s flight schedule in question. But on February 6, the Federal Aviation Administration <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacexs-next-astronaut-launch-for-nasa-is-officially-on-for-feb-11-as-faa-clears-falcon-9-rocket-to-fly-again" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">cleared</a> it for its next flight. NASA will livestream the mission’s prelaunch, launch and docking activities on NASA+, Amazon Prime and on its YouTube channel, with its launch coverage starting at 4AM Eastern time on February 11.
