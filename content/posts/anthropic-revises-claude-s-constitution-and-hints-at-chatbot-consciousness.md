On Wednesday, Anthropic released a revised version of Claude’s Constitution, a living document that provides a “holistic” explanation of the “context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be.” The document was released in conjunction with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

For years, Anthropic has sought to distinguish itself from its competitors via what it calls “Constitutional AI,” a system whereby its chatbot, Claude, is trained using a specific set of ethical principles rather than human feedback.

Anthropic has long sought to position itself as the ethical (some might argue, boring) alternative to other AI companies — like OpenAI and xAI — that have more aggressively courted disruption and controversy. To that end, the new Constitution released Wednesday is fully aligned with that brand and has offered Anthropic an opportunity to portray itself as a more inclusive, restrained, and democratic business. The 80-page document has four separate parts, which, according to Anthropic, represent the chatb
