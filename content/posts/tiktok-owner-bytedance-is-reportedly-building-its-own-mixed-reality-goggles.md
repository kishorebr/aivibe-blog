<p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is reportedly working on mixed reality goggles, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedance-developing-mixed-reality-goggles-challenge-meta"><em>The Information </em>reports</a>. The in-development device is designed to layer digital objects over your view of the real world, and is supposed to compete directly with Meta's upcoming mixed reality products.</p>
<p>The goggles are being built by ByteDance's virtual reality startup Pico, the creators of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pico-4-vr-headset-bytedance-150028514.html">Pico 4 VR headset</a>. Pico's past products have attempted to match Meta's Quest headsets in terms of features, but these new goggles apparently represent a different approach (albeit one still positioned as an alternative to Meta). Rather than a bulky headset, the goggles are supposed to be small and light, about the size of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bigscreen-beyond-review-gunning-for-vr-throne-valve-index-190004793.html">Bigscreen Beyond VR headset</a>, which weighs 0.28 pounds. Pico is keeping the device lightweight by offloading most of the computing work to a puck that's connected to the goggles over a wire. Meta's prototype Orion AR glasses used a wireless puck for a similar weight-saving purpose when <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html">the company demoed them</a> in November 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pico is also reportedly working on building "specialized chips for the device that will process data from its sensors to minimize the lag or latency between what a user sees in AR and their physical movements," <em>The Information</em> writes.</p>
<p>Plenty of the details are still up in the air, but the report notes that the ByteDance / Pico goggles should be very similar to Meta's next mixed reality device. Following the release of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html">Quest 3S</a>, Meta reportedly postponed work on the Quest 4 in favor of developing lightweight mixed reality goggles, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-prioritizing-puffin-for-2026-pushing-out-quest-4-to-2027/">according to <em>UploadVR</em></a><em>. </em>The company has been publicly pushing AI wearables like the newly introduced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-and-oakley-announce-new-perfomance-ai-smart-glasses-for-athletes-140312796.html">Oakley Meta HSTN glasses</a>, and it seems like its next Quest device will be closer to smart glasses than a VR headset with controllers.</p>
<p>It's not known when ByteDance's  goggles will actually be released or where they'll be sold. Current Pico headsets aren't sold in the US, and given the concern over <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/us-tiktok-users-may-soon-have-to-switch-to-a-new-version-of-the-app-110013943.html">ByteDance's ownership of TikTok</a>, it seems unlikely the company would be able to sell a mixed reality device without pushback.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/tiktok-owner-bytedance-is-reportedly-building-its-own-mixed-reality-goggles-212541450.html?src=rss
