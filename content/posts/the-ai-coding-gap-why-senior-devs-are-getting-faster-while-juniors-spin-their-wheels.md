    The AI coding gap: Why senior devs are getting faster while juniors spin their wheels
     
    With close to one-third of code now AI-generated, a new study finds substantial increases in output and unexpected benefits.

Along with it has come a measurable increase in programmer productivity. These are some of the findings from a new study by the Complexity Science Hub (CSH), which examined the impact of AI tools and platforms on software development. Researchers developed a model that was applied to a large dataset covering software development activity across six countries.  Also: I got 4 years of product development done in 4 days for $200, and I'm still stunnedThe cost implications of saving development hours are vast, as US companies alone are estimated to spend more than $600 billion annually on programming-related labor costs, the study's authors point out.Productivity gains correlate with experienceGenerative AI has increased programmer productivity by close to 4%, they estimate. There's a fissure in the data, however: less-experienced programmers use AI more frequently (37%), but productivity gains are seen almost exclusively among experienced developers.  Gen AI reshapes both the volume and nature of programming work, according to the CSH research team, led by Simone Daniotti. "Comparing the same developer before and after adopt
