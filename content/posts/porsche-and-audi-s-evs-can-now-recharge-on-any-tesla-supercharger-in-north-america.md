<p>Starting September 9, Porsche and Audi will be the latest non-Tesla brands to utilize the Supercharger network. The two automakers announced that some of their owners will get adapters that allow them to charge via the NACS port, which Tesla <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-is-offering-its-proprietary-charge-connector-as-a-new-north-american-standard-193223322.html">developed and opened up</a> to other automakers. The rollout comes after the Volkswagen Group, which owns both Porsche and Audi, announced that it would <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-finally-confirms-itll-switch-its-evs-to-teslas-charging-standard-101517391.html">implement NACS compatibility</a> for Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and Scout Motors in December 2023.</p>

<p>Porsche is kicking off its NACS adoption with a &quot;soft launch,&quot; where existing owners of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-new-taycan-evs-have-more-range-faster-acceleration-and-a-higher-price-123514002.html">Taycan</a> and Macan  Electric models have to reserve a free NACS to DC adapter with the My Porsche app to connect to the Tesla Supercharger network. During this initial phase, drivers of compatible Porsche EVs have to use the Tesla app at Superchargers, but will eventually be able to charge with the My Porsche app in &quot;the coming months,&quot; according to Porsche. Like Porsche, Audi is getting its own branded adapter that will arrive with newer 2025 model year options, including its Q6 e-tron, A6 Sportback e-tron and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/audis-refreshed-rs-e-tron-gt-performance-brings-shocking-speed-for-a-premium-price-130154710.html">e-tron GT</a>. Notably, Audi said its Q4 e-tron won&#39;t currently have access to Tesla Superchargers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Porsche, any Taycan and Macan Electric from model year 2026 onward will include a free NACS adapter. However, Porsche EVs from model year 2024 or older will have to buy the adapter from Porsche&#39;s online shop or dealerships, which will go for $185. Porsche and Audi are also working on software updates to show Tesla Superchargers on their navigation systems. Despite Porsche and Audi now gaining access to the Supercharger network, Volkswagen Group&#39;s other subsidiaries, including Lamborghini and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bentley-plugin-hybrid-ev-2026-094121635.html">Bentley</a>, still haven&#39;t committed to adopting NACS.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/porsche-and-audis-evs-can-now-recharge-on-any-tesla-supercharger-in-north-america-173333649.html?src=rss
