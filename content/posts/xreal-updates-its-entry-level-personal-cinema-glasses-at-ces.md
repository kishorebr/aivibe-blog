<p>If you’ve been on the fence about trying the sort of “AR glasses” that, until recently, were called “personal cinemas,” then check this out. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xreal</a> has turned up to CES 2026 with an updated version of its entry level <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-new-one-series-ar-glasses-use-usb-c-to-connect-with-nearly-any-device-191221387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xreal One glasses</a>, first launched at the end of 2024. The new model, dubbed the 1S (yes, with a numeral rather than the word) gets marginally better specs and $50 knocked from the asking price.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, One is a wearable spatial display that connects over USB-C to any compatible device including smartphones, tablets, laptops and consoles. It has two teeny-tiny displays in the eyecups that, when worn close to the eyes, trick your brain into thinking you’re looking at a big screen. The average would measure in at around 171 inches, but it’s possible to push the view to a screen closer to 500 inches if your eyes are capable of focusing that far.</p>
<p>As for the changes, they’re all firmly in the welcome nip-and-tuck department, boosting many of the original’s key specs. For instance, the 1080p screens have been swapped out for 1200p full HD, while the field of view has gone from 50 degrees to 52. Brightness has been boosted from 600 nits on the old model to 700 nits here, while the aspect ratio has grown from 16x9 to 16x10. But the change Xreal is arguably most proud of is the drop in price, from $499 down to $449.</p>
<p>Certainly, the bustling trade show floor is not the best place to sample the delights of Xreal’s 1S, but it was able to make a fairly persuasive argument as to its value. I was able to view <em>Avatar: One Of The Avatar Movies</em> and my eyes were almost tricked into thinking it was viewing it in a small multiplex cinema room. The usual Xreal strengths — that they don’t cause me eyestrain and offer a compelling degree of immersion — are fully evident here.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company is launching the Xreal Neo, an external battery-cum-DisplayPort hub for your glasses. Inside you’ll find a 10,000mAh power bank to keep your glasses going for longer and, more importantly, offers better connection for your Switch consoles. After all, before now, if you wanted to play with your Switch or Switch 2, you’d need to hook it up to its own dock. With the Neo, however, you can eliminate that from your bag when you’re playing out and about. That’s available as a standalone purchase for $99 which, like the new 1S, are ready to buy right now.</p>
