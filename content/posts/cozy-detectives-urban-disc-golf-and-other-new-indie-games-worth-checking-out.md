<p>Welcome to our latest recap of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. This week, the revived Acclaim held a very fun showcase (and we&#39;ll get to some of the games from that). But on Friday, Nintendo soaked up all the attention with an hour-long Direct. Sure, it included some first-party games, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html"><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-will-be-released-on-december-4-for-switch-1-and-2-134718933.html"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-is-getting-a-dlc-expansion-today-140016430.html"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>expansion. But Nintendo highlighted several indie games in the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-metroid-virtual-boy-and-more-all-the-biggest-announcements-from-todays-nintendo-direct-165722897.html">newsy showcase</a>, too.</p>
<p><em>Hades 2</em> is arguably the highest-profile name among those, and the full version isn&#39;t far away at all — it&#39;ll hit Switch, Switch 2, Steam and Epic Games Store <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">on September 25</a>. <em>Stardew Valley, Human Fall Flat, Overcooked 2 </em>and <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> are getting Switch 2 versions as well.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="447eb5e0e7a6441a8c1eaff6247e24a0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex2cdvYWB7o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a Nintendo Direct without a shadowdrop. Sure enough, <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em> landed on <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lynked-banner-of-the-spark-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">Switch and Switch 2</a> on Friday, with mouse control and GameShare support on the newer system. This is an action RPG from FuzzyBot and publisher <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dreamhavens-tabletop-rpg-party-game-sunderfolk-arrives-on-april-23-183006473.html">Dreamhaven</a> that looks a bit like a cross between <em>Hades </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve had <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em> sitting on my PC for months. I&#39;m definitely interested in checking it out, but it&#39;s just one of those things that&#39;s unfortunately slipped further and further down my to-play list. I&#39;m still hoping to carve out time to properly check it out before it&#39;s time to start putting together our games of the year list.</p>
<div id="688676ec9ea04e06bd4d8b08a53ba8fe"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fM1aD2YvA4c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Popucom </em>(which debuted on <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543180/POPUCOM/">Steam</a> earlier this year) also looks pretty intriguing. From Hypergryph and publisher Gryph Frontier, this is a multiplayer-only adventure platformer in which you take out enemies with match three-style shooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the twist: each player only has two colors, so you&#39;ll need to work together to fire the correct blobs at bad guys and obstacles. <em>Popucom </em>is coming to Switch this holiday season.</p>

<div id="a0a448ef6d764d4c906ab916522306af"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axCHAC2N6Lo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Little Problems: A Cozy Detective Game </em>is a new title from the small team at female-led Indonesian developer Posh Cat Studio and publisher Amplified Games. As the name suggests, it&#39;s a slice-of-life detective game that sees you getting to the bottom of misunderstandings and minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>You play as freshman student Mary, and one of the first mysteries you&#39;ll have to solve involves finding the location where her study group is supposed to meet after she forgets where to go on her first day of school. The game has 10 cases overall and each has a set of puzzles to solve. It&#39;s said to have &quot;simple mechanics that grow into playful twists and surprising solutions.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Little Problems </em>seems quite charming and just the kind of low-fi puzzle game that I might vibe with. It&#39;s out now on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2653470/Little_Problems_A_Cozy_Detective_Game/">Steam</a> and it usually costs $10, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until September 23.</p>
<div id="913452870a134306aab6a9e6d4bb9a90"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0boLooPF0g8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Disc golf feels like it would be a fun sport to get into and while there are a few courses near me, they&#39;re not exactly easy to get to without a car. So I might just have to make do with <em>Disc Golf City</em>, which came out of early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3753060/Disc_Golf_City/">Steam</a> for PC, Mac and Linux this week. The action takes place in a colorful city, and you can bounce your disc off of objects in the environment to pull off trick shots and try to land it in the basket.</p>
<p><em>Disc Golf City</em>, which is from Agapo Games, costs $13. There&#39;s also a demo you can check out.</p>
<div id="fa69fc44f5484be185d7cebb2c9e1ae4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VwIe6AtJPxg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Another game that came out of early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1665260/Beyond_Sunset/">Steam</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GOG.com;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e3b8e5db-8fee-44fd-9fa6-1e45522ece33&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;linkText=GOG&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvYmV5b25kX3N1bnNldCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTNiOGU1ZGItOGZlZS00NGZkLTlmYTYtMWU0NTUyMmVjZTMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvYmV5b25kX3N1bnNldCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUYFqmSUVkDSz6kmqAbAxbtLVSm7DxZIJnXReYnev1fb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbeyond_sunset" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_sunset">GOG</a> this week is <em>Beyond Sunset</em>. This is a cyberpunk (not that one) first-person shooter with RPG elements from Metacorp / Vaporware and publisher Movie Games.</p>
<p>I love when a vaporwave color palette is put to good use and the lo-fi visuals here just feel right. The fast-paced movement looks pretty interesting too — it&#39;s not hard to tell that the developers took inspiration from the Doom series. <em>Beyond Sunset</em> costs $10.</p>
<div id="583e14215e584d959afd9ced5dd049c4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAvYl2TOwPY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>It feels like I can&#39;t go on the internet for five minutes without learning about a new sidescrolling Metroidvania game. Still, <em>Katanaut </em>is one I&#39;ve had my eye on for a while. You&#39;ll be facing the horrors that have taken over a space station using an array of weapons, skills and perks.</p>
<p>This is a roguelite from Voidmaw in which there are new pathways to explore on each run. There is some permanent progression here, as you&#39;ll pick up memory fragments during your journey through the station&#39;s gore-soaked corridors. It was also revealed this week that Acclaim is the publisher of <em>Katanaut</em>, which is available on <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Steam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<div id="0e3fcee5f0954bccbaa5c91b9321c88d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXRk1pFRgOc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was one of the more interesting-looking games from last year that I just haven&#39;t gotten around to checking out yet. It&#39;s a driving sim and survival horror game set in a supernatural version of the Pacific Northwest, in which you scour the landscape for parts to upgrade your car and, hopefully, stay alive.</p>
<p>Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive this week announced the <em>Whispers in the Woods </em>expansion for <em>Pacific Drive</em>. Slated to arrive later this year, the DLC adds around eight to 12 hours of gameplay with new characters, dangers, mysteries and anomalies to encounter. Other updates include route modifiers and garage cosmetics to find.</p>
<div id="b72b4704aa7f46fc942aea04b9e319d5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TATp91aZGe0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>The rest of this week&#39;s upcoming games are all from Acclaim, since I found just about everything in that showcase intriguing. The first game that the publisher showed off was <em>GridBeat</em> from Ridiculous Games.</p>
<p>Blending together puzzles, tactics and dungeon crawling, <em>GridBeat </em>will see you infiltrate a corporate computer network and try to escape with valuable data while security programs and malware attempt to stop you. You&#39;ll find more abilities and power-ups along the way. Crucially, you need to move in time to the music, since it&#39;s a rhythm game as well. There&#39;s a lot going on here! <em>GridBeat </em>is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">Steam</a>, but there&#39;s no release window as yet.</p>
<div id="56c08455d22f41908cb3b65cde3cbbe1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_CRBRrUClc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>One thing I was really hoping to see during Acclaim&#39;s showcase was the return of NBA Jam. We didn&#39;t quite get that, but I&#39;ll absolutely take <em>Basketball Classics</em> in its place. Acclaim has taken over publishing duties for this retro, NES-style arcade basketball title from Namo Gamo. It features 5-on-5 sidescrolling action with simplified controls, hundreds of teams, more than 1,000 players and multiple modes (including couch multiplayer).</p>
<p>I hadn&#39;t heard of <em>Basketball Classics</em> until now, but it&#39;s been out on <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/?curator_clanid=45592194">Steam</a> for several years. Acclaim is helping to bring it to consoles sometime soon.</p>
<div id="3d3bbdd14e54412b8c390867e5b98b23"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHk6rCKKkEY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>I do love <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>and am looking forward to the sequel. <em>Pixel Washer </em>looks like a different flavor of that format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a cute lil&#39; piggy with a power washer, you&#39;ll be cleaning just about everything in sight. The trailer suggests that things might get weird, and it even seems like there are boss fights. Valadria is the developer behind Pixel Washer, which is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2572060/Pixel_Washer/">Steam</a> down the line.</p>
<div id="79c7bac3fb9c4e9888855af17118cdb9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hH9sIotgOk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate </em>looks like the offspring of SSX and <em>Jet Set Radio, </em>and that&#39;s enough to sell me on the game. An easy addition to my wishlist.</p>
<p>Wabisabi Design is making this snowboarding game that pits you against NPCs and/or human players in races. In the main game mode, you&#39;ll need to complete a certain number of challenges in each level before you can move on, which is very much keeping in with the Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater format. There&#39;s also a relaxing endless mode, where you can just hang out and explore or, like, whatever.</p>
<p><em>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate </em>supports split-screen play and online multiplayer for up to eight people. Again, there&#39;s no confirmed release date or window as yet, this one is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082730/HYPERyuki_Snowboard_Syndicate/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Acclaim notes that it is &quot;actively exploring console releases&quot; for its games. &quot;Our goal is to bring these experiences to as many players as possible, and we’ll have more updates to share as development progresses,&quot; the publisher added.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cozy-detectives-urban-disc-golf-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110029695.html?src=rss
