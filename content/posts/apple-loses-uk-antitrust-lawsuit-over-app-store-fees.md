<p>Apple will owe money to UK users after losing an App Store antitrust lawsuit there on Thursday, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/37a5c1e4-4433-4b56-b47f-f80fcd3d52b8"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the iPhone maker abused its dominant market position to inflate developer fees.</p>
<p>The tribunal found that the company has &quot;near absolute market power&quot; for iOS app distribution and in-app payments. The decision declared that Apple has been &quot;abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices.&quot; <em>FT</em> reports that Apple will appeal the decision.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The class action claimants said damages of about £1.5bn would be split between 36 million consumers. A subsequent hearing to determine the process for &quot;resolving any questions relating to the calculation&quot; of damages could come as soon as next month.</p>
<p>Apple has an increasingly strained relationship with the tighter regulations across the Atlantic. Earlier this week, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html">stepped up its attacks</a> on the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">protect consumers from Big Tech dominance</a>. And on Wednesday, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-confirms-apple-and-google-have-strategic-market-status-in-mobile-platforms">confirmed</a> that Apple has &quot;strategic market status&quot; in <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-passes-its-version-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-175642166.html">the country&#39;s equivalent</a> of the DMA. That gives the CMA authority to &quot;ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple provided the following statement in response to the ruling:</p>
<p><em>&quot;We thank the tribunal for its consideration but strongly disagree with this ruling, which takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy. The App Store has benefited businesses and consumers across the U.K., creating a dynamic marketplace where developers compete and users can choose from millions of innovative apps. This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments. The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections — giving developers and consumers many options in how they build, share, and download apps. We intend to appeal.&quot;</em></p>
