<p>In a case of deja vu, Stellantis is once again <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/04/jeep-recalling-375000-wrangler-grand-cherokee-4xe-phevs/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">recalling</a> two models of its Jeep brand plug-in hybrid SUVs. The company has recalled at least 320,000 of its Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe cars in the US over concerns of fire risks while driving and while parked. Stellantis is also recalling 20,753 of the Jeep vehicles in Canada, 2,653 in Mexico, and 32,238 outside of North America. A <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27207&amp;mid=" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">statement</a> from Stellantis said an internal investigation discovered 19 fires. </p><p>Jeep also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/jeep-recalls-194000-plug-in-hybrids-due-to-fire-risks-150059282.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">recalled</a> these same two 4xe models in October 2024. The issue then and now was with the EV batteries produced by Samsung SDI. Stellantis has been unable to address the fire risks with software updates and is expected to notify drivers when a remedy for the issue is ready. Until then, the owners of Grand Cherokee 4xe models from 2022 to 2026 and Wrangler 4xe models from 2020 to 2025 are being encouraged to park outside away from buildings and not to plug in their vehicles. So basically these cars are relegated to being very large sculptures until Stellanis can fix the battery problems. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-recalls-more-than-375000-jeep-hybrid-suvs-for-fire-risk-215341226.html?src=rss
