<p>The loss of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html">federal EV tax credits</a> may have been a huge blow to prospective buyers, but California wants to fill that gap for its residents. Governor Gavin Newsom&#39;s proposed budget for 2026-2027, which was released on Friday, includes a &quot;light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) incentive program&quot; that details a one-time infusion of $200 million.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf">budget summary</a>, this incentive program is &quot;a critical part of the Administration&#39;s strategy to keep ZEVs affordable and accessible for all.&quot; The proposed budget still has to make it through the state&#39;s legislature later this year, but if passed, the new incentive would help continue the momentum of EV adoption across California.

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are no details in the budget summary outlining how exactly the $200 million would break down on a per-vehicle basis, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/shopping/2026/01/09/california-ev-tax-credit/88088676007/"><em>USA Today</em></a> reported that the rebate would be an &quot;on the hood&quot; instant discount for EVs. Previously, buyers would get up to $7,500 back in federal tax rebates on new EV purchases and up to $4,000 on used EVs. For California&#39;s proposed incentives, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, Lauren Sanchez, told <em>USA Today</em> that the state is still trying to figure out if it will offer tax credits for those who buy used EVs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/californias-governor-plans-to-set-aside-200-million-for-state-ev-tax-credits-194446449.html?src=rss
