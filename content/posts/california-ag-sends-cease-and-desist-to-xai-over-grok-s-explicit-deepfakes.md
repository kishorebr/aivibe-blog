<p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-xai-demands-it-halt-illegal" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">sent a cease and desist</a> letter to xAI, days after his office <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched</a> an official investigation into the company over reports that Grok was generating nonconsensual </p><p> If you’ll recall, xAI and Grok have been under fire for taking images of real individuals and putting them in revealing clothing like bikinis upon random users’ requests. </p><p>Bonta’s office demands that xAI immediately cease and desist from creating “digitized sexually explicit material” when the depicted individual didn’t consent to it or if the individual is a minor. It also demanded that xAI stop “facilitating or aiding and abetting the creation… or publication of digitized sexually explicit material” of nonconsenting individuals and persons under 18 years of age. </p><p>X <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">changed its policies</a> after the issue broke out and prevented the Grok account from being able to edit images of real people into revealing clothing. xAI also moved Grok’s image-generating features behind a paywall and geoblocked paying users’ ability to edit images of real people into bikinis, but only in regions where it’s illegal.</p><p>In his announcement, Bonta said xAI developed a “spicy mode” for Grok to generate explicit content and used it as a marketing point. The California AG also said that Grok-generated sexual images are being used to harass both public figures and ordinary users. “Most alarmingly, news reports have described the use of Grok to alter images of children to depict them in minimal clothing and sexual situations,” Bonta’s announcement reads. </p><p>“The actions above violate California law, including California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business &amp; Professions Code section 17200,” it said. The state’s Department of Justice now expects to hear from xAI on the steps it’s taking to address these issues within the next five days. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">xAI has been producing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images used to harass women &amp; girls across the internet.<br><br>This is unacceptable.
