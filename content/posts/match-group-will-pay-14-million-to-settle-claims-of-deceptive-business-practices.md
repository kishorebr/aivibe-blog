<p>The Federal Trade Commission announced that Match Group will pay <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/08/match-group-agrees-pay-14-million-permanently-stop-deceptive-advertising-cancellation-billing"><ins>$14 million</ins></a> to settle a complaint about deceptive practices. The settlement fee will be used to provide redress to injured customers of Match Group&#39;s dating services, which include Match.com, Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish.</p>

It will also offer simple mechanisms for customers to cancel their subscriptions. Finally, Match Group will not retaliate or take action against customers who file billing disputes, and it won&#39;t deny those customers access to paid-for services or goods.</p>
