<p>It&#39;s getting to be that time of year again. Summer Game Fest <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.summergamefest.com/"><ins>officially kicks off on June 5</ins></a> and will go until June 8. The Live Kickoff show will once again be hosted by Geoff Keighley and takes place on June 5 at 5PM ET. This is where we&#39;ll see all of those juicy reveals and trailers.</p>
<p>The opening event will be streamed globally on just about every digital platform, including YouTube, Twitch, X and even Steam. Those in the Los Angeles area will be able to pick up tickets for the live show sometime in the Spring.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The kickoff event is just the beginning. There&#39;s something called Play Days, which is an expo in downtown LA produced by iam8bit. This invite-only event promises &quot;immersive exhibits and hands-on experiences from the industry&#39;s leading publishers and developers.&quot; Coverage of this will be shared across digital and social platforms.</p>
<p>There is, of course, another <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.dayofthedevs.org/"><ins>Day of the Devs</ins></a> livestream scheduled for immediately after the kickoff. Day of the Devs: SGF Edition should provide us with even more trailers and reveals, this time for indie games.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s a &quot;thought leadership event&quot; on June 8 that&#39;s primarily for developers and publishers. Game Business Live &quot;brings together top industry voices on one stage for insightful discussions on key changes, challenges and opportunities shaping the global video game industry.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be covering the event live and will have all of those trailers ready to go. After all, that&#39;s pretty much the main reason people watch these things.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-runs-from-june-5-8-193054418.html?src=rss
