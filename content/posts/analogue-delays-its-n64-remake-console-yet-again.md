<p>Analogue&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-is-almost-ready-and-its-a-big-deal-150033468.html">4K take on the Nintendo 64</a> is… still not quite here. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue3d-shipping-in-q4">announced</a> its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that&#39;s an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn&#39;t a huge concern.</p>
<p>The postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-says-its-delayed-n64-remake-console-will-start-shipping-next-month-191520648.html">due to tariffs</a>.) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. &quot;We know this sucks,&quot; the Pocket maker wrote. &quot;Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies.</p>

<p>So, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue&#39;s take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It&#39;s also adding &quot;original display mode&quot; filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They&#39;re similar to those you find on the company&#39;s highly rated <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011-150056369.html">Analogue Pocket handheld console</a>.)</p>
<p>Analogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. &quot;The last 1% is where we&#39;re focused,&quot; the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards. Nonetheless, pre-orderers who wish to bail can do so by contacting support.</p>
<p>Frustrations aside, delays are indeed better than shipping incomplete products — even if only by one percent. &quot;We&#39;re pushing without pause and appreciate everyone&#39;s patience and trust,&quot; the company wrote in an email to customers. &quot;Analogue will always deliver — delays or not, it&#39;s a commitment to our standard of care.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html?src=rss
