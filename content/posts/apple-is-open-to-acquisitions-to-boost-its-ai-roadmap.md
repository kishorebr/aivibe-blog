<p>Apple leadership discussed results and updates today in its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">third-quarter</a> conference call, including some statements about its AI endeavors. As reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/apple-aapl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, CEO Tim Cook said that the company is &quot;significantly growing out investments&quot; in artificial intelligence, which shouldn&#39;t be much of a surprise for any players in the tech space. However, Cook did acknowledge that an acquisition to boost its work in AI wasn&#39;t out of the question. &quot;Weâ€™re open to M&amp;A that accelerates our roadmap,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cook said that Apple is &quot;not stuck on a certain size company&quot; as a possible target for an AI-related purchase. He noted that Apple has acquired &quot;about&quot; seven businesses so far this year across multiple disciplines but that none were &quot;huge in terms of dollar amount.&quot;</p>

The news is still sparse on that subject; according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-crushes-wall-street-expectations-iphone-sales-soar-2025-07-31/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Cook simply stated that the team is &quot;making good progress on a personalized Siri.&quot; Despite hopes that Siri improvements would be unveiled at WWDC 2025, the latest projections are that the AI-powered update to that service might not be ready until <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html"><ins>spring 2026</ins></a>.</p>

That has led to speculation that it may look externally to improve its standing in the race to build the best AI features.
