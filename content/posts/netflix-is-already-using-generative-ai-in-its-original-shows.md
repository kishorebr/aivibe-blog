<p>Netflix admitted during its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_Transcript.pdf">earnings call on Thursday</a> that it used generative AI to create VFX in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80216888"><em>The Eternaut</em></a>, a Netflix original from Argentina that was released in April 2025. The company's co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that generative AI was specifically used for a VFX shot in the post-apocalyptic drama, but the move is one of several ways Netflix is embracing AI.</p>
<p>According to Sarandos, the creators of <em>The Eternaut</em> wanted to include a shot of building collapsing in Buenos Aires, and rather than contract a studio of visual effects artists to create the footage, Netflix used generative AI to create it. "Using AI powered tools, they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed," Sarandos shared during the earnings call. "In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with... traditional VFX tools and workflows."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shot "just wouldn't have been feasible for a show on that budget," Sarandos says, as someone with some input on the show's budget. The executive says that <em>The Eternaut </em>features "the very first Gen AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film." Clearly, the show is also a prototype for how Netflix can avoid costs it doesn't want to swallow in the future.</p>
<p>Workers in the entertainment industry have not taken kindly to the use of generative AI. Labor strikes — including the recently resolved <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sag-aftra-has-suspended-its-gaming-industry-strike-over-ai-protections-204240996.html">SAG-AFTRA video game strike</a> — have made securing protections against AI a central issue. The Oscar-nominated film <em>The Brutalist</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/oscar-hopeful-the-brutalist-used-ai-during-production-223016216.html">came under fire in 2024 for using AI tools</a> during production. Beyond that, whether generative AI models were illegally trained on copyrighted material is still an open question.</p>
<p>Netflix plans to use generative AI <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-figured-out-a-way-to-make-ads-even-worse-using-ai-180623064.html">to create ads</a> for its ad-support Netflix subscription, and the company is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/netflix-is-reportedly-testing-a-search-function-powered-by-openai-190025983.html">reportedly testing</a> a new search feature powered by OpenAI models. Using generative AI in production might seem par for the course for a company that's already invested, but it could help to normalize a technology that many creatives remain actively against.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-already-using-generative-ai-in-its-original-shows-201209502.html?src=rss
