<p>Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-switch-2-review-simple-but-effective-140016952.html">very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2</a>, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.sfbags.com/collections/cases-for-nintendo-switch/products/magnetic-case-for-nintendo-switch?tab=Details">Waterfield's Magnetic</a> case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-design-drape-me-in-this-leather">Design: Drape me in this leather</h2> 
<p>Compared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="88a7310580b542c5b75b02a3c31b5599" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.sfbags.com/products/magnetic-case-for-nintendo-switch?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>I've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.</p> 
<p>But the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="d08ef9c3-69ca-469f-b1bf-4714c3bc2641" /> 
<p>The obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.</p> 
<p>On the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.</p>

<p>This case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/leather-cord-organizer">cord clips</a>, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>Starting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-switch-2-review-simple-but-effective-140016952.html">Belkin's Charging Case</a>, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.</p>

<p>But the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss
