<p>After testing the feature <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-is-testing-a-live-now-feature-with-streamers-and-the-nba-174443865.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">in a limited beta</a>, Bluesky is making its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3mcibezwvxk2g" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;Live Now&quot; badge</a> for streamers available for everyone on the social network to try. Live Now is included as part of Bluesky&#39;s v1.114 update, alongside &quot;cashtags,&quot; a separate type of hashtag for collecting conversations about publicly-traded companies.</p><p>Bluesky first started testing its Live Now badge in May 2025 with a limited group of accounts, including the official NBA account. The feature lets Twitch streamers with Bluesky profiles append a Live Now badge to their profile picture that links directly to their livestream. Live Now badges are limited to Twitch links for now, but Bluesky says &quot;support for other streaming platforms may follow&quot; as it learns from the beta. Linking to other social platforms shouldn&#39;t be a radical concept, but since Bluesky&#39;s competitor X has tried to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-temporarily-blocked-users-from-sharing-links-to-signal-170642960.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">prevent users from posting links</a> in the past, the company has made it a point of trying to do the opposite.</p><p>Cashtags are a similar attempt to appeal to a certain type of veteran X user. Originally <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/twitter-introduces-ticker-symbol-cashtags-for-finance-searches/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a feature of pre-Musk Twitter</a>, cashtags work like a hashtag, marking posts in a way that makes them easy to find in a search or by tapping the cashtag itself. On Bluesky, by typing a dollar sign ($) and the stock abbreviation of a company (AAPL for Apple, for example), you can add a cashtag to your post that links it to other posts using the same cashtag. So far, the cultural makeup of Bluesky hasn&#39;t seemed as business-oriented as X, but the feature suggests Bluesky wants the option to be available for anyone who jumps ship.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/blueskys-live-now-badge-is-available-to-everyone-223335221.html?src=rss
