<p>Lenovo is no stranger to laptops with funky displays. The company has made a notebook with a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-codename-flip-is-another-wild-take-on-a-flexible-screen-laptop-230051495.html">tri-fold screen</a>, one with a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html">rollable panel</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-think-pad-x-1-fold-hands-on-big-upgrades-inside-and-out-specs-price-040007760.html">multiple systems</a> with <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-foldable-pc-review-specs-price-181519620.html">flexible displays</a>. But this year at IFA, Lenovo is testing out yet another new design with its latest concept laptop, and this time it may have created the ultimate doomscrolling machine.</p>
<p>Its official name is the ThinkBook Vertiflex Concept and when it&#39;s closed, it looks almost exactly like a traditional 14-inch clamshell laptop. But if you look closer, you&#39;ll notice that its screen has a secret feature: the ability to rotate 90 degrees into portrait mode. This means you can switch to a taller aspect ratio for tasks like coding, editing photos and videos, or simply browsing your favorite vertically-oriented social media app.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, to enhance its portrait mode capabilities, Lenovo included support for pairing the laptop with your phone via its Smart Connect app, which allows you to mirror or extend the latter’s display on a bigger screen or quickly transfer files just by dragging and dropping. In a lot of ways, the Vertiflex Concept feels like the laptop version of one of LG&#39;s last phones — <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-wing-5g-preview-hands-on-swivel-screen-140137108.html">the LG Wing</a> — while also sharing a lot of similarities with TVs like the rotating <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-29-samsung-the-sero-vertical-tv.html">Samsung Sero</a>. And given the continued rise in popularity of vertical photos and videos on social media, it&#39;s actually kind of a surprise that it&#39;s taken a mainstream PC maker this long to create a laptop like this.</p>

<p>On a more practical level, I really appreciate that even with a rotating display, it doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s much of a penalty when it comes to added heft or thickness. The Vertiflex Concept weighs just three pounds and measures 0.7 inches thin, which isn’t far off from what you’d get from a typical 14-inch ultraportable. And while Lenovo hasn’t provided much in the way of hardware specs (this is a concept device after all), I noticed that the laptop does feature a healthy number of connectivity options, including two USB-C ports, one USB-A connector, a full-size HDMI jack, 3.5mm audio and a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>Now, Lenovo has shown off more concept devices than practically any other major OEM in recent history, so of course, the Vertiflex wasn’t the only prototype the company had on display for IFA 2025. There was also the Smart Motion Concept,  but that felt less impactful because instead of being a standalone product, this thing is merely a laptop stand. It uses the sensors on whatever it’s connected to to track your face and automatically reposition your laptop’s screen in the right position.</p>

<p>The idea is that if you&#39;re making a presentation, the stand allows your laptop to better keep your face in frame while also making sure its mics and speakers are pointed in the optimal direction. Alternatively, if you&#39;d rather control the stand yourself, the device can be paired to a ring with gesture support. Finally, Lenovo says the Smart Motion concept also has some features to do things like help you maintain ergonomically friendly postures.</p>
<p>However, as both products are experimental devices, there&#39;s no word on whether Lenovo will turn these into proper retail offerings. But if either the Vertiflex or Smart Motion concepts strike your fancy, you might want to say something (maybe on social media for the social-media focused laptop) to give Lenovo a bit of extra encouragement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-latest-laptop-concept-might-be-the-ultimate-doomscrolling-machine-060000162.html?src=rss
