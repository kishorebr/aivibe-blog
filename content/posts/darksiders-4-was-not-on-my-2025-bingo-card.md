<p><em>Darksiders 4</em> is officially coming. During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase on Friday, we got a glimpse at the next game in the hack and slash action-adventure franchise, alongside trailers for roughly a dozen other games that are in the works, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/reanimal-promises-a-more-terrifying-journey-than-little-nightmares-200457474.html"><em><ins>Reanimal</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eternal-life-of-goldman-is-a-gorgeous-platformer-that-looks-like-a-hand-drawn-cartoon-173751928.html"><em><ins>The Eternal Life of Goldman</ins></em></a>. It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve seen a new mainline Darksiders title from developer Gunfire Games, and while the fourth entry follows 2019&#39;s prequel, <em>Darksiders Genesis</em>, the announcement says it will &quot;continue where the original Darksiders game left off.&quot;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://darksiders4.thqnordic.com/#order"><em><ins>Darksiders 4</ins></em></a> features all four Horsemen, and you&#39;ll get to choose which one to play as. It features &quot;combat, traversal and puzzle solving in a lore rich post apocalyptic world.&quot; The teaser doesn&#39;t give us much information beyond that and there&#39;s no release date just yet, but we do know it&#39;ll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you missed the showcase, you can <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://showcase.thqnordic.com/"><ins>catch up here</ins></a> on everything that was announced (like that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DRlBipcHY"><ins>new Spongebob game</ins></a>). And according to THQ Nordic, that&#39;s only half of what it has up its sleeve. At the end of the showcase, the publisher said a total of 28 games are currently in development, with 15 we still have yet to see.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/darksiders-4-was-not-on-my-2025-bingo-card-204611075.html?src=rss
