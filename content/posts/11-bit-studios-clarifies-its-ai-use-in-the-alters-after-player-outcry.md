<p>11 Bit Studios has drawn the ire of players for the undisclosed use of artificial intelligence in its recent release, <em>The Alters</em>. The new project from the team behind <em>Frostpunk</em> and <em>This War of Mine</em> is a narratively and thematically interesting take on a science fiction survival game. The project contains a lot of dialogue and written text, and some players <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation"><ins>discovered</ins></a> in-game copy that appeared to be generated by a large language model. The Steam storefront <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/valves-new-guidelines-will-allow-for-more-ai-content-in-games-134515623.html"><ins>requires</ins></a> that games disclose when they contain material that is either pre-generated or live-generated by artificial intelligence, and <em>The Alters</em> had not been tagged as including AI content. The studio has issued a lengthy statement in response to the complaints.</p>
<p>One instance involved AI-generated text in a graphic asset. 11 Bit Studios said this asset was only meant to be used as a placeholder during development. "This was never intended to be part of the final release," the company said. "Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other AI use that players uncovered was in some cases of translations. According to 11 Bit Studios, AI was used for subtitle translations on the licensed movies that can be played in social area of the in-game base, which it said were made by an external source without creative input from its team:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented."</p></blockquote>
<p>AI is an increasingly delicate subject for creative professionals. Many companies with large language models have either been <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-and-universal-studios-file-suit-against-midjourney-for-copyright-infringement-154206053.html">accused of</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-startup-argues-scraping-every-song-on-the-internet-is-fair-use-233132459.html">admitted to</a> training on copyrighted content, which has made AI an ethical nonstarter for many artists and many players. But when studios are regularly faced with negative working conditions surrounding crunch, it's also understandable why the gaming industry might be inclined to look for ways to speed up the process of shipping a title. The reactions to AI appearing <em>The Alters</em> is likely just the latest in the ongoing conversations about when and how this tech might be a part of game development.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/11-bit-studios-clarifies-its-ai-use-in-the-alters-after-player-outcry-220014181.html?src=rss
