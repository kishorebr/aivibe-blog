<p>Much like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>, Thief&#39;s long-awaited return is a VR exclusive. The game was announced in June, but now we <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/thief-vr-quest-gameplay-release-date/">know</a> when it will arrive. You can play the pioneering stealth franchise&#39;s new chapter, <em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</em>, on December 4.</p>
<p><em>Thief VR</em> takes place about halfway between the events of the original trilogy and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-24-thief-review-for-the-hoard.html"><em>Thief</em> (2014)</a>. You play as Magpie, a cunning thief (duh), who discovers a legendary eye artifact with a mysterious connection to the past. You&#39;re operating in a city that&#39;s under the grip of Baron Ulysses Northcrest, &quot;a tyrant who crushes rebellion before it can take root.&quot; That all sounds like an ideal backdrop for sneaking around and stealing shit.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Publisher Vertigo Games offered a glimpse at Meta Quest gameplay, which you can watch below. <em>Thief VR</em> will also be available on PS VR and SteamVR when it arrives on December 4. The title has a $30 list price on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/">Steam</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/">Meta</a>, but can be pre-ordered now for $27. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010853/">PlayStation Store</a> version doesn&#39;t yet have pricing or reservation info.</p>
