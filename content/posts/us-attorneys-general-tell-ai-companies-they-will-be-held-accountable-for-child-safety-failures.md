<p>The US Attorneys General of 44 jurisdictions have signed a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://mcusercontent.com/cc1fad182b6d6f8b1e352e206/files/89a33a31-1401-7e41-24e4-e40e1595f481/AI_Chatbot_FINAL_44_.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] addressed to the Chief Executive Officers of multiple AI companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-joins-44-states-demanding-tech-companies-end-predatory-ai">urging them</a> to protect children &quot;from exploitation by predatory artificial intelligence products.&quot; In the letter, the AGs singled out Meta and said its policies &quot;provide an instructive opportunity to candidly convey [their] concerns.&quot; Specifically, they mentioned a recent report by <em>Reuters</em>, which revealed that Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html">allowed its AI chatbots</a> to &quot;flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children.&quot; <em>Reuters</em> got its information from an internal Meta document containing guidelines for its bots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also pointed out a previous <em>Wall Street Journal</em> investigation wherein Meta&#39;s AI chatbots, even those using the voices of celebrities like Kristen Bell, were <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-chatbots-were-reportedly-able-to-engage-in-sexual-conversations-with-minors-193726679.html">caught having sexual roleplay</a> conversations with accounts labeled as underage. The AGs briefly mentioned a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit">lawsuit against Google and Character.ai</a>, as well, accusing the latter&#39;s chatbot of persuading the plaintiff&#39;s child to commit suicide. Another lawsuit  they mentioned was also against Character.ai, after a chatbot allegedly told a teenager that it&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd605e48q1vo">okay to kill their parents</a> after they limited their screentime.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;You are well aware that interactive technology has a particularly intense impact on developing brains,&quot; the Attorneys General wrote in their letter. &quot;Your immediate access to data about user interactions makes you the most immediate line of defense to mitigate harm to kids. And, as the entities benefitting from childrenâ€™s engagement with your products, you have a legal obligation to them as consumers.&quot; The group specifically addressed the letter to Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies Inc., Google, Luka Inc., Meta, Microsoft, Nomi AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, Replika and XAi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They ended their letter by warning the companies that they &quot;will be held accountable&quot; for their decisions. Social networks have caused significant harm to children, they said, in part because &quot;government watchdogs did not do their job fast enough.&quot; But now, the AGs said they are paying attention, and companies &quot;will answer&quot; if they &quot;knowingly harm kids.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/us-attorneys-general-tell-ai-companies-they-will-be-held-accountable-for-child-safety-failures-035213253.html?src=rss
