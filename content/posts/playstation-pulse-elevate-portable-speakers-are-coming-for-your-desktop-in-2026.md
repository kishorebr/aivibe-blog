<p>Sony&#39;s lineup of gaming-focused audio devices is growing with the addition of the PlayStation Pulse Elevate wireless speakers. They work with PC, Mac, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation Portal, and they support Bluetooth and Sony&#39;s proprietary PlayStation Link Wireless connection scheme. The Pulse Elevate speakers come in white or black, and they&#39;re due to hit the market in 2026. There&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/introducing-pulse-elevate-sony-interactive-entertainments-first-wireless-speakers-for-desktop-gaming/">no word on price</a> just yet.</p>

<p>The Pulse Elevate speakers can be set on charging stands when playing at your desk, or they can be disconnected and used in portable mode. When not docked, they have (an unspecified number of) &quot;hours of battery life,&quot; according to Sony&#39;s hype trailer. The speakers support 3D audio, they can be tilted back, and they have planar magnetic drivers, built-in woofers and an integrated mic with noise reduction.</p>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The PlayStation Pulse Elevate speakers join Sony&#39;s Pulse Elite gaming headset and Pulse Explore earbuds. The earbuds retail for $200 and the headset goes for $150, so feel free to use these price points as the foundation of indiscriminate speculation about how much the Elevate speakers will cost when they land next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-pulse-elevate-portable-speakers-are-coming-for-your-desktop-in-2026-215320963.html?src=rss
