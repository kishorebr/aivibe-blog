<p>The movie stars Jack Black as Steve, the original player character from the video game, who ends up transported into the voxel world of <em>Minecraft</em>, while Jason Momoa stars as an egomaniacal former gaming superstar. The movie will also debut on the HBO linear cable channel on Saturday, June 21, at 8PM ET.</p>
