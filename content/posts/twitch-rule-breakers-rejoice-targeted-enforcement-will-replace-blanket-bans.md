<p>The 10th TwitchCon is underway. The weekend&#39;s opening keynote covered new features for streamers and some enforcement changes. As for the latter, Twitch is, in most cases, moving away from blanket bans and toward targeted enforcement. So, a chat violation may not affect an account&#39;s ability to stream, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Dual-format streaming, which <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/twitch-is-adding-1440p-and-vertical-streaming-091533811.html">lets you go live in vertical and horizontal views</a> at once, is getting a beta rollout. Twitch tested the feature with a small number of accounts beginning in August. The wider beta kicks off next week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, AI made an appearance at the keynote. First, Auto Clips is a new feature that automates highlight creation for streamers. Twitch also mentioned that Meta&#39;s AI glasses will soon support Twitch live-streaming. (We first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html">learned that feature was coming</a> at Meta Connect in September.) An update to the Twitch mobile app will add that support within &quot;the next few months.&quot;</p>
<p>Streamers will be happy to learn that Twitch is adding ways for them to make money. It plans to increase the number of sponsorship deals on the platform. The company said this was due to growing advertiser enthusiasm for Twitch streamers. Twitch will begin rolling out the new offers to all monetizing streamers (including affiliates) in the coming months.</p>
<p>TwitchCon runs through this Sunday in San Diego.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/twitch-rule-breakers-rejoice-targeted-enforcement-will-replace-blanket-bans-183046229.html?src=rss
