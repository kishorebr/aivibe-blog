<p>It’s not <em>Psychonauts 3</em>, but <em>Keeper</em> already looks to be a visually stunning and highly original gaming experience. Double Fine Productions and the company's art director Lee Petty showed off the official announcement trailer for its latest title during the Xbox Games Showcase at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-new-at-summer-game-fest-2025-marvel-tokon-resident-evil-requiem-and-more-185425995.html">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. It's not as hype as the news of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/persona-4-revival-is-real-and-coming-to-ps5-pc-and-xbox-182120544.html"><em>Persona 4 Revival</em></a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-outer-worlds-2-arrives-on-october-29-172540150.html"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, but this quirky third-person adventure game looks like a fun departure from your typical AAA title.</p>

<p>As seen in the trailer, <em>Keeper</em> puts you in control of a magically reassembled lighthouse that's since grown legs and has a strange desire to venture towards the central mountain peak of the island. There's no dialogue for this game, but you won't be alone since an equally adventurous seabird joins you on your mysterious mission. There's little revealed about the storyline, but the trailer shows that the lighthouse's beam of light can interact with the island's wildlife, while your trusty winged companion can take care of anything out of your reach.</p>
