<p>The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) submitted a new measure that allows it to photograph any non-US citizen who enters or exits the country for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/civil-rights-groups-cbp-facial-recognition-airports-seaports-211020854.html">facial recognition purposes</a>. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-19655.pdf">filing</a> with the government&#39;s Federal Register, CBP and the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/us-homeland-security-will-reportedly-collect-face-scans-of-migrant-kids-133042516.html">Department of Homeland Security</a> are looking to crack down on threats of terrorism, fraudulent use of travel documents and anyone who overstays their authorized stay.</p>
<p>The filing detailed that CBP will &quot;implement an integrated, automated entry and exit data system to match records, including biographic data and biometrics, of aliens entering and departing the United States.&quot; The government agency already has the ability to request photos and fingerprints from anyone entering the country, but this new rule change would allow for requiring photos of anyone exiting as well. These photos would &quot;create galleries of images associated with individuals, including photos taken by border agents, and from passports or other travel documents,&quot; according to the filing, adding that these galleries would be compared to live photos at entry and exit points.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These new requirements are scheduled to go into effect on December 26, but CBP will need some time to implement a system to handle the extra demand. According to the filing, the agency said &quot;a biometric entry-exit system can be fully implemented at all commercial airports and sea ports for both entry and exit within the next three to five years.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/cbp-will-photograph-non-citizens-entering-and-exiting-the-us-for-its-facial-recognition-database-184557905.html?src=rss
