<p>Adobe Photoshop <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2026/01/27/new-photoshop-innovations-provide-creative-pros-more-control-realism-precision" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">introduced</a> some new features that are rolling out for creators today. As you&#39;d expect from any service operator in this day and age, there&#39;s some AI involved. Adobe has improved the tools for Generative Fill, Generative Expand and Remove that are powered by its Firefly generative AI platform. Using these tools for image editing should now produce results in 2K resolution with fewer artifacts and increased detail all while delivering better matches for the provided prompts. The Reference Image option for Generative Fill has also been upgraded to deliver &quot;geometry-aware results that better match the scene.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;One of the other new updates is a beta version of Dynamic Text, which should allow simpler transformation of a text layer into a curved shape. Photoshop has also added new adjustment layers: Clarity, Dehaze and Grain. These allow non-destructive image editing on layers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobe-photoshop-upgrades-its-firefly-powered-generative-ai-editing-tools-213737915.html?src=rss
