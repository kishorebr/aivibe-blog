<p>Apple manages to hold onto its recent repairability record with the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-vs-iphone-17-pro-which-one-is-right-for-you-001538431.html">iPhone Air</a>, which maintains a provisional 7 out of 10 in iFixit&#39;s teardown. As seen in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown">teardown</a>, the iPhone Air can easily swap batteries, has a modular USB-C port and offers day-one repair guides. Even though the iPhone Air represents Apple&#39;s thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm, iFixit said the slim design makes repairs &quot;more approachable, not less.&quot;</p>

<p>Apple kept the same battery design that was introduced with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ifixit-tears-down-the-iphone-16e-now-with-repairable-usb-c-charging-port-151558784.html">iPhone 16</a> lineup, which switched to an electrically released battery adhesive for more consistent replacements. Similarly, you don&#39;t have to ever risk damaging the OLED display when swapping an iPhone Air battery, since there&#39;s still that dual-entry access allowing you to access it from the back glass.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Being a smartphone that emphasizes thinness, Apple had to sacrifice some battery life with the iPhone Air. However, in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">our review</a>, we found that the iPhone Air was comparable to other models in the iPhone 17 lineup and lasted nearly an entire day in real-world testing. iFixit also discovered that the battery is the same exact one found in the accompanying <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/you-absolutely-should-not-buy-apples-iphone-air-magsafe-battery-pack-131009089.html">MagSafe Battery</a> accessory that goes for $99, which iFixit likened to a &quot;spare tire.&quot; On top of that, the included battery is encased in metal, making it easier to replace and offering some protection against bending.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ifixits-teardown-shows-the-iphone-air-doesnt-sacrifice-repairability-for-thinness-161641244.html?src=rss
