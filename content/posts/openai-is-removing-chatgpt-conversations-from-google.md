<p>OpenAI has removed a feature that made shared ChatGPT conversations appear in search results. The &quot;short-lived experiment&quot; was based on the chatbot&#39;s link creation option. After complaints, OpenAI&#39;s chief information security officer, Dane Stuckey, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/cryps1s/status/1951041845938499669">said</a> the company is working to remove the chats from search engines.</p>
<p>The public outrage stems from a <em>Fast Company</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91376687/google-indexing-chatgpt-conversations">article</a> from earlier this week (<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-users-shocked-to-learn-their-chats-were-in-google-search-results/">via</a> <em>Ars Technica</em>). <em>Fast Company</em> said it found thousands of ChatGPT conversations in Google search results. The indexed chats didn&#39;t explicitly include identifying information. But in some cases, their contents reportedly contained specific details that could point to the source.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be clear, this wasn&#39;t a hack or leak. It was tied to a box users could tick when creating a shareable URL directing to a chat. In the pop-up for creating a public link, the option to &quot;Make this chat discoverable&quot; appeared. The more direct explanation (&quot;allows it to be shown in web searches&quot;) appeared in a smaller, grayer font below. Users had to tick that box to make the chat indexed.</p>
<p>You may wonder why people creating a public link to a chat would have a problem with its contents being public. But <em>Fast Company</em> noted that people could have made the URLs to share in messaging apps or as an easy way to revisit the chats later. Regardless, the public discoverability option is gone now.</p>
<p>In <em>Fast Company</em>&#39;s report, Stuckey defended the feature&#39;s labeling as &quot;sufficiently clear.&quot; But after the outcry grew, OpenAI relented. &quot;Ultimately, we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn&#39;t intend to, so we&#39;re removing the option,&quot; Stuckey announced on Thursday.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-removing-chatgpt-conversations-from-google-194735704.html?src=rss
