<p>It's almost time for another one of Samsung's Unpacked events. The third Unpacked to be held this year (following installments in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2025-live-updates-on-the-galaxy-25-launch-galaxy-ai-and-more-110043358.html">January</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-live-updates-from-the-unpacked-event-130052975.html">May</a>) will take place on July 9 at 10AM ET. It will emanate from Brooklyn, New York and stream on the Samsung Newsroom, the company's website and its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Samsung is promising a look at the "next evolution of Galaxy AI and the ever-expanding Galaxy ecosystem." The company usually debuts its latest foldables in the summer, so <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/what-to-expect-at-the-next-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-150001731.html">we are expecting</a> to see the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 here. As if there was any doubt that this Unpacked will focus on foldables, an image Samsung sent out along with event invitations (embedded below) makes that clear. It's looking like the rumored Galaxy Z Fold Ultra is in store too, as a teaser video includes the phrase "Ultra Unfolds." Way to be subtle, Samsung.</p>

<p>A new Galaxy Watch also seems likely to make an appearance, while rumors have been flying around that this Unpacked may feature a Galaxy S25 FE, which is slated to arrive later this year. We may even get a glimpse of a Samsung tri-fold phone. Meanwhile, the Android XR headset that Samsung has been <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">working on with Google</a> is slated to arrive this year â€” this Unpacked seems like a good opportunity for the company to spill the beans on that.</p>
<p>If you're already pretty sure that you're going to switch to a new Samsung device, you don't necessarily have to wait until July 9 to make a reservation for one of the upcoming models.
