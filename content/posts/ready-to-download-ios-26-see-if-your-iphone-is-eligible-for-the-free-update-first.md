<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025, as a few models are getting the axe this time around. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to receive the boot in 2023, and this year, iPhones released in 2018 will be left behind.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-if-i-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-iphone"><strong>What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-should-i-upgrade-to-ios-187-or-ios-26">Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?</h2>
<p>When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26. Apple released the former to address security issues, so you can at least download that one if you're unsure about all the big changes on iOS 26. It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Snooze longer (or shorter):</strong> Say goodbye to the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms (if you want). You now have the option to<a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-change-your-iphones-snooze-length-in-ios-26-112017653.html"> change your snooze time</a> from one to 15 minutes.</p>

That means less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens is too dirty.</p>
