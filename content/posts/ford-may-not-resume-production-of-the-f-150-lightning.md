The model is an electric pick-up truck, and the best-selling one in the US, but the publication cited Ford execs who said the company would consider halting production completely on the F-150 Lightning. We’ve reached out to Ford for comment and will update if we receive a statement.</p><p>The auto brand said it would cut back on production <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-is-cutting-f-150-lightning-production-due-to-waning-demand-173838340.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">last January</a> due to slowing demand for the vehicles. At the time, Ford shuffled several of the workers who had been building the F-150 Lightning to constructing other auto models. Then, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/23/ford-halts-f-150-lightning-production-focus-on-gas-and-hybrids/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a fire</a> this October at an aluminum plant supplying Ford led the company to pause production of the Lightning trucks. In Ford&#39;s third-quarter financial <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">results</a>, its Model e electric vehicle operation lost $1.4 billion, and has lost $3.6 billion over the first nine months of 2025. Rather than projects such as the F-150 Lightning, Ford has hinted that it will shift strategy to work on smaller, more affordable electric vehicles based on its Universal EV platform.</p><p>Ford may not be the only manufacturer to ramp down its EV plans in the US. A federal tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing EVs was abruptly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">ended</a> in September under the current administration&#39;s financial policies. After unveiling its latest EV models this week, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe spoke to <em>Engadget</em></a> about the potential long-term impact: &quot;With the Trump administration in place, we have a sense that maybe the EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years or so into the future.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-may-not-resume-production-of-the-f-150-lightning-221903848.html?src=rss
