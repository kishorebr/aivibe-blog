The company has previously <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/new-tools-incentives-creators-mobile-worlds">experimented</a> with NPCs for its metaverse, but the upcoming update will be the first time developers have access to customizable embodied characters.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For players, this means the NPCs they encounter will be able to engage more dynamically and respond to specific interactions rather than only relying on scripted responses.

And given that its Connect event is just a few weeks away, there’s a good chance we’ll hear more about how generative AI is changing Meta’s virtual worlds very soon.
