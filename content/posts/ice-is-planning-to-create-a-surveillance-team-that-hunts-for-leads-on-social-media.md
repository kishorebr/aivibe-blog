<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-removes-iceblock-from-the-app-store-after-trump-administrations-demand-031659651.html">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) has plans to build out a 24/7/365 surveillance team that focuses on scouring social media for case leads, as revealed in documents first discovered by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/"><em>Wired</em></a>. According to public records, ICE has put out a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/37b379dbed484281a12530cc01835e04/view">request for information</a> — which allows the agency to detail its preliminary scope of work to gauge any interest from contractors — that details using social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit and YouTube to develop leads on wanted individuals.</p>
<p>For &quot;urgent cases,&quot; the team is expected to work on leads with ICE&#39;s Top 10 Most Wanted within a 30-minute timeframe. However, the breadth of work ranges all the way to low-priority cases, like those involving someone convicted of a non-violent misdemeanor or &quot;has no convictions but has a significant arrest history,&quot; with a more generous eight-hour window to generate leads.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the documents, ICE wants at least 12 full-time staff to work at its National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center in Williston, Vermont, which will require three staffers on duty at all times. On the other side of the country, ICE is looking for a minimum staff of 16 full-time contractors for its Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Santa Ana, California, that will also have a duty rotation of at least two staffers on for &quot;after-hour requirements and emergency situations.&quot;</p>
<p>While the plans are in the very early stages, ICE&#39;s plans are aggressive and even ask how prospective contractors would use artificial intelligence to achieve its goals. The federal agency is no stranger to controversial tech though, as it has previously been accused of using <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/senators-demand-ice-cease-use-of-facial-recognition-app-172146833.html">facial recognition</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/ice-is-planning-to-create-a-surveillance-team-that-hunts-for-leads-on-social-media-163743143.html?src=rss
