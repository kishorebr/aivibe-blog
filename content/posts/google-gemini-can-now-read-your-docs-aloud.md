<p class="has-text-align-none">Google Docs will now let you generate an audio version of your documents using AI. In a post <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/08/listen-to-documents-using-gemini-google-docs.html">announcing the rollout</a>, Google says you can customize Gemini’s AI audio output with different voices and playback speeds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This feature isn’t just for a document’s creator, as Google says readers can access a shared document’s AI-generated audio by selecting the <strong>Tool</strong> dropdown menu and selecting <strong>Audio</strong> <strong> &gt; Listen to this tab</strong>. Authors can also add a customizable audio button directly in a document by choosing <strong>Insert &gt; Audio</strong>, which readers can click to start listening.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google announced plans to let you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645986/gemini-can-now-turn-your-google-docs-into-podcasts">turn your documents into AI podcasts</a> in April, but this feature seems a lot handier if you just want to listen to what you’ve written. You can only generate audio versions of documents in English and on desktop devices for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is rolling out audio in Docs to Workspace users with business, enterprise, or education plans, as well as users who have AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions.</p>
