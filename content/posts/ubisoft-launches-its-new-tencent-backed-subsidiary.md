<p>Ubisoft has launched — and named — its Tencent-backed subsidiary. Vantage Studios is the first of the company's "creative houses" under a previously-announced reorganization. The new studio will oversee the company's tentpole franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>The news follows Ubisoft's <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-spins-out-subsidiary-with-a-billion-dollar-investment-from-tencent-183516992.html">March announcement of a new subsidiary</a> with a €1.16 billion ($1.36 billion) investment from Tencent. The Chinese company took a minority ownership stake in Vantage as part of the deal. In July, Ubisoft <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">named</a> the new subsidiary's co-CEOs: Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"Our focus is on evolving Ubisoft's operating model to bring more focus, more autonomy and more accountability to the teams so they can stay closely attuned to our players," Guillemot said at the time. "Decision making will be quicker, and it will also be easier to pivot when we need to change course."</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-brandnew-subsidiary-vantage-studios">announcement</a> today reflected that language. The idea is to give its developers "a higher level of autonomy" at Vantage and future studios. It wants the new structure to enable "a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback."</p>
<p>Vantage is the only creative house the parent company has announced. The company will set up future ones "under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise." However, it's unclear what other creative houses will work on, with Vantage taking over Ubisoft's bread-and-butter franchises.</p>
<p>Vantage's team will be spread across Ubisoft's offices in Montréal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona and Sofia. Multiple gaming publications, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-tencent-backed-subsidiary-now-has-a-name-vantage-studios"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, reported that the studio began operations today. Ubisoft is said to have chosen "Vantage Studios" based on a vote by its 2,300 employees. As for Tencent, it will reportedly act in an advisory role, with the co-CEOs having the final word.</p>
<p>Ubisoft was due for some big changes. The company has endured <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html">big-name flops, studio closures and layoffs</a>.
