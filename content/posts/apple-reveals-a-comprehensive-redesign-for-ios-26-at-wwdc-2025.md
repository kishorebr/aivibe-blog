<p>Every year, iOS is one of the star attractions of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/apple/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Apple_Inc." data-original-link="">Apple</a>&#39;s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote. It&#39;s our first official look at new features and other changes that are coming to iPhones in the fall. The 2025 WWDC keynote was no exception, and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/ios-26-is-official-apple-changes-from-version-numbers-to-years-for-its-os-names-172129166.html">the most immediate change is to the iOS naming system</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-rumored-to-release-ios-26-not-ios-19-at-wwdc-2025-193424610.html">As was recently reported</a>, Apple operating systems will all be named after years to keep everything aligned. So instead of iOS 19, we&#39;re jumping up to iOS 26. The same goes for iPadOS, watchOS, macOS and so on. The versions will be named for the year <em>after</em> major annual OS updates (so iOS 26 for the version that arrives in fall 2025 etc), but it should still help mitigate some confusion as to which is the current version.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s a lot more to this version of iOS than a change to the numbering system, so let&#39;s dig right in.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-a-major-redesign">A major redesign</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/85442de0-4555-11f0-bfff-243e016b9074" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/85442de0-4555-11f0-bfff-243e016b9074" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="New lock and home screens are more " data-uuid="acc43ca1-db5d-3dde-8516-eeeef19b2f49"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the naming system, the biggest change this year is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">a major visual overhaul</a> across Apple&#39;s operating systems. These responsive, translucent user interfaces are inspired by the look of visionOS, the OS that powers Apple Vision Pro. It&#39;s been over a decade since the last major change to the look of the iPhone user interface. With iOS 7, which debuted in 2013, Apple jettisoned its skeuomorphic design language for a flatter, more simplified look.</p>
<p>It was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-reportedly-demo-its-liquid-glass-interface-redesign-with-see-through-visuals-at-wwdc-165823089.html">reported over the weekend</a> that Apple&#39;s new user interface design language would be built around a concept called Liquid Glass, and that turned out to be dead on. There is a larger focus on factors like light and transparency here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>App icons and buttons have new looks, while toolbars and tab bars will have a see-through appearance. Apple is also making use of pop-out menus that&#39;ll offer quick access to certain options â€” that reminds me a bit of the &quot;peek and pop&quot; 3D Touch functions Apple introduced to the iPhone a decade ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Widgets aren&#39;t going anywhere, though they&#39;re getting a new look to match the rest of the design updates. On the lock screen, the clock font can change size dynamically, so it can shrink as alerts come in.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a97dc640-455e-11f0-bff5-4ec7c916ba52" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a97dc640-455e-11f0-bff5-4ec7c916ba52" style="height:551px;width:980px;" alt="New CarPlay UI" data-uuid="3977658c-bddf-3c2a-8048-b93d77456f9f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure>
<p>CarPlay is among the other user interfaces that&#39;s getting this visual redesign. It will feature a more compact view for incoming calls so the display doesn&#39;t obfuscate directions. Tapbacks (i.e. emoji responses) and pinned conversations are coming to Messages in CarPlay, and widgets and Live Activities can be reflected on the infotainment system. These updates will be present in <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/apples-carplay-ultra-finally-arrives-but-its-exclusive-to-aston-martins-right-now-132516946.html">CarPlay Ultra</a> too.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-core-app-updates">Core app updates</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/6d5534d0-4556-11f0-b7f8-6c0551eb714b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/6d5534d0-4556-11f0-b7f8-6c0551eb714b" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="New look on the Calls screen." data-uuid="554751b0-9293-3a53-b8b5-bf1eae005e3a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple is giving several core apps notable updates in iOS 26. In the Phone app, it&#39;s pulling together your recent calls and voicemails into a single tab, with your favorite contacts above those. You&#39;ll be able to see Apple Intelligence summaries of voicemail transcripts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A call screening tool can automatically answer calls from unknown numbers as well. You&#39;ll be able to see on your iPhone screen who is calling and why, so you can decide whether to answer. On the other side of that, a Hold Assist feature can let you know when a live agent is available, so might never have to listen to interminable hold music ever again. (Android has had these features for ages, for what it&#39;s worth.)</p>
<p>On FaceTime calls, you&#39;ll see that Apple has moved the major controls to the bottom right of the screen for easier access. Safari will have a more transparent address bar in the updated OS, as well as &quot;advanced fingerprinting protection&quot; for all browsing by default for extra privacy.</p>
<p>As for the Camera app, Apple is looking to simplify that a bit after adding several features like slow-motion video and panoramic photos over the last several years. You&#39;ll switch between still photo and video options with a swipe. Tabs are blessedly coming back to the Photos app too.</p>
<p>In Messages, you&#39;ll have the ability to set a background image and create polls (much as you can in other messaging apps). The backgrounds will be the same for everyone in the chat, as they are in the likes of Messenger. It&#39;ll be possible to send and receive Apple Cash payments in group chats, which will also be getting typing indicators.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/ead30f90-4556-11f0-b9fd-f3fc4686367c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/ead30f90-4556-11f0-b9fd-f3fc4686367c" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="New unknown senders tab." data-uuid="f1f630ef-7a69-3268-b011-fa0cdf0092fb"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>On-device spam detection for Messages is in the pipeline. That&#39;s a very welcome update, though if Apple handles all of that for me, I&#39;ll kinda miss replying to scammers with a carefully crafted insult before immediately blocking and reporting them. Anyway, you&#39;ll have the option to screen messages from unknown senders and place them in a separate folder from your regular chats, though it should still be easy to find two-factor authentication codes.</p>
<p>As for Wallet, you&#39;ll be able to create a digital ID from your passport. A refresh of boarding passes will provide real-time updates on flights in Live Activities, as well as maps for airport navigation, a quick way to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/united-airlines-will-integrate-apples-share-item-location-feature-into-its-mobile-app-130049823.html">report missing bags</a> and more.</p>
<p>Maps will be able to learn preferred routes (for things like making the school run before going to work). It can provide updates about these learned routes, such as what the traffic is like. A Google Maps-like location history option will be available as well. Apple says this is end-to-end encrypted and it can&#39;t see your data.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/66c6f980-4558-11f0-a7f9-9cdb68aa73e0" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/66c6f980-4558-11f0-a7f9-9cdb68aa73e0" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The new Apple Games has a library tab that might remind you of Podcasts or Spotify." data-uuid="89faa1f4-08b1-3332-977d-afdc16561dda"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>There will be a new core app in iOS 26: Games. From here, you&#39;ll be able to view and download titles from Apple Arcade and have access to your library, multiplayer options (such as achievements) and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple has been making a bit more of a push into games over the last few years between Apple Arcade and getting ports of major games like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-is-coming-to-select-apple-devices-on-january-30-173544260.html"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2022-games-upscaling-metal-3-metalfx-resident-evil-village-no-mans-sky-190905515.html">multiple Resident Evil titles</a> for its devices. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this works in action and if there&#39;ll actually be interest from gamers. After all, did anyone ever actually use Game Center?</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-ai-features">AI features</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/72452210-4557-11f0-9fff-16f7fccd9b7e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/72452210-4557-11f0-9fff-16f7fccd9b7e" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Live Translation also translates phone calls in real time." data-uuid="d67c9fc2-cff4-303b-9fb9-b7c00f9438f1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple Intelligence <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html">hasn&#39;t exactly been a huge success</a> for the company so far, but there are AI-powered features that seem genuinely useful coming to iOS 26. Apple is integrating translation tools more deeply into the operating system, so you may not have to switch over to Translate (or, perhaps more likely, Google Translate) as often.</p>
<p>The most impactful aspect of that will be <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-introduces-ai-powered-live-translation-tools-at-wwdc-2025-173605234.html">live translation</a> for text and audio in phone calls, FaceTime and Messages, powered by on-device models. That could be a massive deal for many iPhone users.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a685c020-4557-11f0-bf27-6ecbd07aa2cc" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a685c020-4557-11f0-bf27-6ecbd07aa2cc" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Mix songs like a DJ with AutoMix." data-uuid="a8d3880a-70d1-33cc-b5e7-afaf5072c6ac"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Live translation and pronunciation guides for lyrics in Apple Music is cool â€” I might finally be able to sing a decent version of the Babymetal verse in &quot;Ratatata.&quot; On the subject of Apple Music, an AutoMix feature will use intelligence to perhaps make for smoother, DJ-style transitions between songs through time stretching and beat matching. Moving album art is going to be a thing in the app too.</p>
<p>Since WWDC is an event that&#39;s largely for developers, news that they&#39;ll <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-opens-its-foundational-ai-models-to-developers-171133003.html">be able to tap into on-device Foundation Models</a> for their apps could be a boon. Among other things, they&#39;ll be able to integrate live translation into their apps.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a6b677a0-4558-11f0-aeb5-0f16ca49742f" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a6b677a0-4558-11f0-aeb5-0f16ca49742f" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Example of Visual Intelligence in action -- see a cool pair of sneakers and pull up all the information from your camera." data-uuid="60d763db-877c-3e28-895b-58106557e609"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Apple is taking another leaf out of the Google playbook with a visual intelligence update. You&#39;ll be able to ask ChatGPT questions about what&#39;s displayed on your screen, and seek more information from supported apps such as Google and Etsy. Visual intelligence will detect when you&#39;re looking at an event and may suggest adding it to your calendar.</p>
<p>The Shortcuts app is getting an update including options powered by Apple Intelligence and dedicated actions for the likes of Writing Tools and Image Playground. Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence will be able to pick up and summarize tracking information from emails related to your purchases, including ones that you didn&#39;t make with Apple Pay. Apple says this will let you see your order details and delivery progress details all in one place. That&#39;s something the Shop app from Shopify has been handy for, and now Apple&#39;s looking to handle that itself.</p>
<p>There are minor AI updates elsewhere, such as to Genmoji (you&#39;ll have the option to combine two existing emoji). The upgraded Siri Apple has been talking about for a while is still in the works, and we&#39;ll hear more about that later this year.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-updates">Other updates</h2>
<p>Apple is making some changes to parental controls in iOS 26. The company says it&#39;ll be easier for you to create Child Accounts and move your kids into them. Other updates include being able to grant kids exemptions to download apps with age ratings that are outside of the restrictions that parents set. Apple will also blur &quot;sensitive content&quot; in FaceTime calls and photos in Shared Albums.</p>
<p>There are several new accessibility features too. Accessibility Reader is said to offer &quot;a customized systemwide reading experience,&quot; while Braille Access is a new interface for iPhone devices that have connected braille displays. Meanwhile, Apple says it will deliver a &quot;new level of accessibility&quot; across its ecosystem with updates to Live Listen, Background Sounds, Personal Voice and other tools.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-will-your-iphone-be-compatible-191854628.html">You&#39;ll be able to install iOS 26</a> if you have an iPhone 11 or later (or a second-gen iPhone SE). Apple Intelligence features will run on iPhone 16 devices, Phone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and future models, as well as compatible iPads and Macs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developers can try out the iOS 26 features starting today through the Apple Developer Program. <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-26-betas-are-available-next-month-180213420.html">Public betas of the new operating systems</a> will be available in July. Apple will make iOS 26 and the other new operating systems available this fall, likely soon after its annual iPhone event, which typically takes place in September.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-comprehensive-redesign-for-ios-26-at-wwdc-2025-171650751.html?src=rss
