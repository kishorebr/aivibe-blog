<p>It might be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/teens-are-becoming-more-worried-about-the-effects-of-social-media-113027657.html">near impossible</a> to be a kid these days without a smartphone, but AT&amp;T wants to offer parents a decent compromise. The wireless carrier launched its AmiGO Jr. Phone, which combines Samsung hardware and AT&amp;T&#39;s app, to offer kids a smartphone that has parental controls baked right in.</p>
<p>The AmiGO Jr. Phone is just a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-phone-and-fit3-tracker-are-coming-the-us-193710051.html">Samsung Galaxy A16</a>, which still remains a solid budget smartphone pick with a 50-megapixel main camera, a 6.7-inch display and reliable battery life. However, AT&amp;T tweaked the Samsung hardware into its kid-friendly smartphone by including features like live location tracking, safe zones and screentime restrictions that can be controlled via the AmiGO app. It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve seen a smartphone with parental controls, since competitors like Bark and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-pinwheel-watch-is-a-kid-safe-apple-watch-ultra-lookalike-to-placate-your-tween-123005235.html">Pinwheel</a> have been on the market for a couple of years now, but it&#39;s the first time a major mobile carrier is offering its own standalone product.</p>

You still have to pay for your monthly service charges as an AT&amp;T customer, but it&#39;ll be cheaper than buying a Galaxy A16 outright for $200. For even more security, AT&amp;T also launched its AmiGO Jr. Watch 2 to expand its ecosystem that already includes a tablet designed for kids.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/atts-budget-friendly-phone-for-kids-was-designed-with-parental-controls-in-mind-202200139.html?src=rss
