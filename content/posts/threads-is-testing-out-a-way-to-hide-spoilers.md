<p>Meta is testing a way to hide spoilers on Threads, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DK-BydcJHkF?xmt=AQF09bmx0yUaFf_wsC-OwORirobNRARXgqCf__v7ObumgA">a new post from Mark Zuckerberg</a><em>. </em>The feature lets you obscure text or an image so that they're only viewable once they're tapped or clicked.</p>
<p>In the current version being tested, you have to highlight your chosen text or tap on the image and then tap "Mark spoiler" to hide it. Inside the Threads app there's even a swirling particle animation that covers text and images before flittering away when you tap on them.</p>

<p>Meta suggests the feature is being added to make it easier to talk about ongoing shows without accidentally spoiling anything. The platform has a growing community of users who use Threads to discuss media, and an algorithmic feed that makes it pretty easy to get a spoiler dumped in front of you. Not many social media platforms outside of Reddit offer a way to obscure spoilers, either. Instead, users often have to turn to more general moderation tools like muting words or phrases to avoid learning things before they've watched a new movie or show.</p>
<p>The new spoiler feature doesn't appear to be widely available yet, but it's just the latest in a series of changes Meta has been experimenting with in Threads over the last few months. The biggest being the addition of a dedicated DM inbox. Up until this point messaging someone on Threads sent you to Instagram DMs, but Meta is now <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-finally-getting-its-own-dm-inbox-160001216.html">testing a separate Threads DM inbox</a> in Hong Kong, Thailand and Argentina.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-testing-out-a-way-to-hide-spoilers-182346919.html?src=rss
