For the diehard fans out there, the latest test of patience comes from <em>Insider Gaming Weekly</em>&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA">podcast</a>, which claimed that the third installment in the Half-Life franchise is set to release with the launch of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html">Steam Machine</a> sometime in spring 2026.</p>
<p>&quot;The window I was specifically told was spring 2026 for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, for Half-Life 3,&quot; Mike Straw, one of the hosts of the <em>Insider Gaming Weekly</em> podcast and senior editor at <em>Insider Gaming</em>, said. &quot;At the end of the day, the game is real.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Straw added that all the previous dates for an announcement of the next Half-Life game have passed, but that his sources &quot;are still adamant this is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.&quot; However, being tied to Valve&#39;s latest hardware release could be an issue since Straw noted that the explosive jump in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html">RAM pricing</a> is causing considerable concern for the Steam Machine&#39;s pricing announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a concern, however, they haven&#39;t made a decision on price, which is kind of holding back the announcement of anything else,&quot; Straw said. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what&#39;s going on on the component side.&quot;</p>
<p>While optimistic devotees were hoping for some teasers during <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html">The Game Awards</a>, Valve hasn&#39;t officially said anything. However, there&#39;s still a lot of hope, especially considering Valve updated <em>Half-Life 2</em> for its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-celebrates-half-life-2s-20th-anniversary-with-a-big-update-174316547.html">20th anniversary</a>, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html">previous rumors</a> hinted at a game that&#39;s still in development but is playable from beginning to end.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-rumored-to-be-a-steam-machine-launch-title-and-could-arrive-in-spring-2026-193029413.html?src=rss
