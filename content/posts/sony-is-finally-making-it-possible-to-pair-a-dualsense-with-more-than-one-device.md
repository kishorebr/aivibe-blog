<p>Sony is bringing a welcome quality-of-life <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/"><ins>feature</ins></a> to the PlayStation 5. In the next PS5 system update beta, players will be able to have their DualSense controllers synced with multiple hardware platforms at the same time. That means you could swap a controller from a PS5 to your gaming PC to your smartphone without needing to re-pair the DualSense each time.</p>
<p>Up to four devices can be simultaneously paired with a single controller, and each of them will be mapped to one of the action buttons. To switch between them, first make sure the hardware you want to start using is on, then press the controller&#39;s PS button and the corresponding action button at the same time. Hold for three seconds, and when you see blinking on the controller&#39;s light bar, release both buttons.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s the sort of change that may not carry weight for all players. But for those of us who do like to hop between platforms, this is very exciting news. The current beta access is limited to an invite-only guest list, but Sony said it plans to roll out the feature globally &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-finally-making-it-possible-to-pair-a-dualsense-with-more-than-one-device-211715133.html?src=rss
