<p>GameStop has been specializing in making <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-reddit-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-043010277.html">pretty</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-axes-its-short-lived-nft-marketplace-as-it-retreats-from-crypto-215911813.html">wacky</a> headlines in recent years, and its latest follows in that grand tradition. After employees at the retailer stapled Switch 2 receipts to boxes in a way that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box"><ins>punctured some of the consoles' screens</ins></a>, the company promised that it would "make things right" for those customers. In addition to giving replacement Switch 2s to those people, GameStop has decided to turn the whole viral event into a publicity stunt for charity. Today, it <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1943008910073303421"><ins>posted</ins></a> on X that it would auction off the "infamous" stapler responsible for the incident, with the proceeds benefiting the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731"><ins>eBay listing</ins></a> for the notorious stapler currently has a top bid of $18,000. But if you really want to have not just a stapler, but also the first Switch 2 it broke, the box with the puncture marks and the offending stapler, feel free to throw your money at it.</p>
