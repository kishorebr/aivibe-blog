<p>Nominees for The Game Awards were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-include-clair-obscur-hollow-knight-silksong-and-hades-2-173626649.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">released</a> yesterday, and there&#39;s a whole lot of indie excellence on display. However, one notable contender among them has decided to withdraw from contention.&nbsp;</p><p>The fabulously titled <em>Megabonk</em> received a nod for the Best Debut Indie Game category. However, the project creator, who currently goes by vedinad, announced on X today that they were withdrawing. &quot;I&#39;ve made games in the past under different studio names, so <em>Megabonk</em> is not my debut game,&quot; the solo dev <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">said</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m withdrawing from The Game Awards.<br><br>It&#39;s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don&#39;t think it qualifies for the category &quot;Debut Indie Game&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game 🥸</p>— Megabonk (@MegabonkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The category is kind of a weird one, since indie creators may have worked at other big or small studios. Even fully self-taught devs will have made and maybe even released several projects before having any kind of breakthrough success or popularity. But if vedinad feels the game doesn&#39;t fit the category, then it&#39;s still a gracious move to bow out.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Megabonk</em> follows in the recent lineage of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, a popular bullet-hell roguelike that just arrived in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/vampire-survivors-vr-asks-what-if-the-bullet-hell-was-on-your-face-190749256.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">virtual reality</a>. The Megabonk riff takes the 2D concept into a low-poly 3D and adds some pretty wacky characters into the mix. Venidad said the title sold <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">1 million copies</a> in just two weeks, making it one of the latest Steam indie sensations to have a big moment.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/megabonk-has-withdrawn-from-the-game-awards-212822746.html?src=rss
