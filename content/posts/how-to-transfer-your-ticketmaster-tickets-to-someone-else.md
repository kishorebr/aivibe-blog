<p>That reunion tour concert you booked a few months ago is creeping up on your calendar, but you're going to be trapped at home because life gets in the way sometimes. If you booked your ticket through <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/ticketmaster-proudly-announces-it-will-follow-the-law-and-show-prices-up-front-194624489.html">Ticketmaster</a>, you can easily transfer your pass to someone else instead of letting it turn into an empty seat.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-transfer-tickets-in-the-tickermaster-app">How to transfer tickets in the Ticketmaster app</h2>
<p>If you have the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ticketmaster-buy-sell-tickets/id500003565">Ticketmaster app</a>, you can locate the ticket you want to transfer in the My Tickets section. Once there, hit the Transfer button, where you'll be prompted to enter a one-time code to verify your identity. After confirming, you can select the tickets in question and hit the Transfer To button. You'll have to enter the contact info for who you're sending the tickets to, which can either be a mobile number or an email address. Once your recipient has claimed the transferred ticket through a text message or email, you'll get a confirmation email that the process is completed and your own ticket is no longer valid.</p>

<p>If you prefer to do things through a web browser, the process is very similar. Using the Ticketmaster website, you have to first sign in to your account before following the same steps as laid out in the app. If you have a specific team or venue that works with Ticketmaster, search for it on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7db38175-cff2-4dcb-8cbc-13d76196dd2a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Account+Manager&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FtLnRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZGIzODE3NS1jZmYyLTRkY2ItOGNiYy0xM2Q3NjE5NmRkMmEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYW0udGlja2V0bWFzdGVyLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW1aILWs65LyJpkizgUzX3HOvnGmOcWDPLqfKB5-R508&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fam.ticketmaster.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://am.ticketmaster.com/">Account Manager</a> page and then sign in. Once logged in, you can transfer tickets in the same way as the app or the Ticketmaster website.</p>

<p>Before you go through with your transfer, it's important to note that whoever you're sending the ticket to needs to have a Ticketmaster account. And, some venues or artists will opt out of the ability to transfer tickets, so it may not always be an option. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ticketmaster/comments/1d9d2jq/ticket_transfer_disabled/">Some users</a> also reported that Ticketmaster's transfer option isn't available until a few days before the event, so you may have to plan accordingly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/how-to-transfer-your-ticketmaster-tickets-to-someone-else-154023783.html?src=rss
