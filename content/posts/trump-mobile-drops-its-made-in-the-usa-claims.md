<p>The Trump Organization <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/god-help-us-donald-trump-is-launching-trump-mobile-and-plans-to-sell-a-phone-155830166.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> a cellular brand earlier this summer, and its main selling point for Trump Mobile was that its T1 smartphone was "made in the USA."

Now, the website for the device has removed all language indicating that it was manufactured in the US. Instead, there is broader language such as "designed with American values in mind" and "Premium Performance. Proudly American."</p>

The listed screen size has shrunk from 6.78 inches to 6.25 inches, and there's no longer any information about RAM. The phone is also offering a more general "later this year" availability time frame rather than promising to arrive in September. Despite walking back the loud promises made about the device, it seems unlikely the changes will matter to anybody who wants to buy this thing.</p>
