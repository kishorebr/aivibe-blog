<p>Researchers at MIT have been working with the South Korean beauty company Amorepacific for the past few years to develop a wearable &quot;electronic skin&quot; platform that can provide real-time insights about skin aging and make personalized skincare recommendations, and it&#39;s due to debut at CES 2026 as &quot;Skinsight.&quot; Skinsight, which was announced as one of the CES 2026 Innovation Award Honorees this week, is a Bluetooth-equipped sensor patch that sticks to the skin and works with a mobile app, tracking skin tightness, UV exposure, temperature and moisture.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Amorepaciifc__Advanced_Electronic_Skin_Platform__Skinsight____Sensor_Patch.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Amorepaciifc__Advanced_Electronic_Skin_Platform__Skinsight____Sensor_Patch.jpg" style="height:1415px;width:2000px;" alt="An artist&#39;s rendering of the Skinsight patch showing various sensors and a bluetooth module" data-uuid="fd7a94f2-2394-4f8e-815d-bf805f5405c8"><figcaption>An artist&#39;s rendering of the Skinsight patch showing various sensors and a bluetooth module</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amorepacific</div></figure><p>Based on the readings, the AI-powered app will approximate how the different factors might contribute to or speed up skin aging, and suggest the products best suited for the job so the user can incorporate them into their skincare routine. The patch is designed to be breathable and withstand sweat so it can stay on for long periods of time. The team hasn&#39;t yet shared on Skinsight&#39;s availability and cost.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/mit-researchers-and-beauty-brand-amorepacific-made-a-wearable-patch-that-analyzes-skin-aging-225125621.html?src=rss
