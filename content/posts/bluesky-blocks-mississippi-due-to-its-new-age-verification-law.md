<p>Users with Mississippi IP addresses can no longer access the Bluesky app. The decentralized social media network has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126">explained</a> in a post that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-supreme-court-lets-mississippis-social-media-age-verification-law-go-into-effect-231405142.html">Mississippi&#39;s new age verification law</a> for social networks &quot;would fundamentally change&quot; how it operates, and it wouldn&#39;t be possible to comply with its small team and limited resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bluesky says that while it does follow the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">UK&#39;s Online Safety Act</a>, it works very differently from Mississippi&#39;s approach to age verification. In the UK, it&#39;s only required to check for a user&#39;s age if they&#39;re accessing certain content and features. In Mississippi, however, it cannot allow anyone to access its service at all, unless they hand over sensitive data proving how old they are. Further, the platform will be required to keep track of which users are children under 18, and it will be responsible for making sure those users won&#39;t be able to access &quot;harmful materials.&quot; Earlier this month, the Supreme Court decided <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-supreme-court-lets-mississippis-social-media-age-verification-law-go-into-effect-231405142.html">not to intervene</a> with the legislation, allowing it to go into effect.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The service says that it doesn&#39;t have the significant resources needed to be able to build the required &quot;verification systems, parental consent workflows and compliance infrastructure.&quot; In addition, it could be penalized with up $10,000 per user if the government finds it to be non-compliant. Because only big tech companies can afford the costs associated with those requirements, Bluesky says the &quot;dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.&quot;</p>
<p>Bluesky will now show a note to any user accessing the service from Mississippi, telling them why it&#39;s no longer available in the state.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-blocks-mississippi-due-to-its-new-age-verification-law-133049512.html?src=rss
