<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Like clockwork, Apple has introduced a new M-series chip on updated versions of the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">iPad Pro</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-first-m5-laptop-is-the-14-inch-macbook-pro-131314446.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">MacBook Pro</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> and for the first time, </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Apple Vision Pro.</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> The new M5 chip shares plenty of similarities with the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m4-chip-arrives-with-a-big-focus-on-ai-142448428.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">M4 chip</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> Apple introduced in 2024, but the biggest seems to be a focus on improving graphics and AI performance.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The M5 chip is made using a new third-generation 3nm process, according to Apple, with an updated 10-core GPU architecture on all versions that offers four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4, while carrying over support for things like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The M5 also features a 10-core CPU, just like the M4, with six efficiency and up to four performance cores.&nbsp;</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/M5-chip-ipad-pro.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/M5-chip-ipad-pro.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The M5 chip configurations for the iPad Pro." data-uuid="b9d2b458-49f3-4c1b-9d44-f6437fa2e30c"><figcaption>The M5 chip configurations for the iPad Pro.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">That is unless you&#39;re buying an M5 iPad Pro. The 1TB and 2TB models of the Pro feature a 10-core CPU and GPU, but if you opt for a smaller storage size of 256GB or 512GB, you&#39;ll get a nine-core CPU with six efficiency cores and three performance cores. Apple says the 10-core CPU offers &quot;up to 15 percent faster multithreaded performance&quot; over the M4 chip, though it&#39;s not clear if that&#39;s due to the CPU or memory improvements. Thatâ€™s because the new chip offers an improved memory bandwidth of 153GB/s, up from the starting 120GB/s bandwidth on the M4, though less than what you can get with the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-introduces-the-m4-pro-chip-which-finally-brings-thunderbolt-5-support-150549096.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">M4 Pro</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> or </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-unveils-its-top-of-the-line-m4-max-chip-150241987.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">M4 Max</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. Apple will likely release M5 versions of both chips next year, but it&#39;s worth knowing what you&#39;re missing if you opt for the M5 right now.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The performance gains Apple was able to squeeze out of its new GPU and improved memory bandwidth seem like the biggest changes users will actually notice from the M5. That includes &quot;up to 30 percent faster&quot; graphics performance than the M4 and &quot;up to a 45 percent graphics uplift in apps using ray tracing.&quot; Apple introduced the M4 with a focus on dynamic caching and ray tracing, and it seems like the M5 makes both graphical processes more efficient. The gains are apparently even more noticeable on the M5 Vision Pro, where the headset can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate, up from the 100Hz max Apple guaranteed before, and is now able to render &quot;10 percent more pixels.&quot;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">AI performance is also improved, though not necessarily thanks to the M5&#39;s 16-core Neural Engine alone, which seems to be the same Neural Engine used in the M4. Instead, Apple&#39;s taking a new approach to AI processing by including dedicated &quot;Neural Accelerators&quot; in each core of its GPU. This extra help has led to faster performance when devices are using Apple Intelligence skills or AI-powered features like the Vision Pro&#39;s ability to generate a Persona, according to Apple.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In-depth testing and benchmarking of Apple&#39;s new M5 devices will be required to accurately capture how the M5 chip changes things, especially when it comes to general CPU performance. For now, though, Apple&#39;s chips continue to get more graphically powerful, which bodes well for anyone who uses MacBooks and iPads for creative tasks, AI or playing games.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html?src=rss
