<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are no small upgrade from the previous generation. ANC is twice as effective as that of the AirPods Pro 2, thanks to a combination of ultra-low noise microphones, computational audio and new foam-infused ear tips, which make for both a better fit and improved noise isolation, according to Engadget's Billy Steele, who spent some <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-closer-look-at-the-airpods-pro-3-anc-live-translation-and-heart-rate-tracking-193956229.html">hands-on time with the earbuds</a>. The Live Translation feature fared well when tested on Spanish-to-English and French-to-English translations, making the earbuds a potentially handy tool to have for travel. (You'll need an iPhone with Apple Intelligence in order to use Live Translation, though).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The earbuds earned a score of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">90 in Engadget's review</a>, which notes noticeable improvements in sound quality and battery life. Apple says you'll get up to eight hours on a charge with ANC enabled. With the addition of heart-rate monitoring and support for 50 workouts using Apple's Fitness app, the AirPods Pro 3 allow you to get heart rate metrics during exercise without wearing an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>There's a lot to like about the latest version of the AirPods Pro, so discount or not, you can't go wrong if you've been holding out for a meaningful upgrade. Per our review, "The AirPods Pro 3 is the biggest update to Appleâ€™s earbuds lineup in years."</p>
