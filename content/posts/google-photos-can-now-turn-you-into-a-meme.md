<p>In Big Tech&#39;s never-ending quest to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">increase AI adoption</a>, Google has unveiled a meme generator. The new Google Photos feature, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Me Meme</a>, lets you create personalized memes starring a synthetic version of you.</p><p>Google describes Me Meme as &quot;a simple way to explore with your photos and create content that&#39;s ready to share with friends and family.&quot; You can choose from a variety of templates or &quot;upload your own funny picture&quot; to use in their place.</p><p>The feature isn&#39;t live for everyone yet, so you may not yet have access to it. (A Google representative <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/google-photos-latest-feature-lets-you-meme-yourself/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">told</a> <em>TechCrunch</em> that the feature will roll out to Android and iOS users over the coming weeks.) But once it arrives, you can use it in the Google Photos app by tapping <strong>Create</strong> (at the bottom of the screen), then <strong>Me Meme</strong>. It will then ask you to choose a template and add a reference photo. There’s an option to regenerate it if you don’t like the result.</p><p>Google says Me Meme works best with well-lit, focused and front-facing portrait photos. &quot;This feature is still experimental, so generated images may not perfectly match the original photo,&quot; the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16763021" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">warns</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-photos-can-now-turn-you-into-a-meme-213930935.html?src=rss
