<p>We found the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a> to have a pretty decent battery life for such a thin-and-light phone, somewhere in the region of 27 hours if you’re continuously streaming video. But it&#39;s still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you&#39;re using it constantly. That’s where Apple’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFH9BST?">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p>

<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> 
<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.
