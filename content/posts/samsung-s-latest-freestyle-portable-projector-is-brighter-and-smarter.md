<p>Samsung has upgraded its Freestyle portable projector for 2026. The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon.&nbsp;</p><p>While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface. It&#39;ll also support Samsung&#39;s Vision AI Companion.&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t announced a specific release date yet for the new projector, but says it&#39;s targeting the first half of the year. It&#39;ll be released in phases globally.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss
