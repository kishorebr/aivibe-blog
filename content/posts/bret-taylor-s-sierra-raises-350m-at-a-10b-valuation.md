Investors are clearly bullish about former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor’s AI agent startup Sierra.

Sierra, which helps enterprises build customer service AI agents, announced it raised a $350 million funding round on Thursday. The round, led by earlier investor Greenoaks Capital, values the startup at $10 billion, according to a company blog post that confirmed an earlier report from Axios on Wednesday.


	
	




	
	



Sierra was founded in early 2024 by Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor. The company claims to have landed hundreds of customers, including SoFi, Ramp, and Brex, among others, in its 18 months of operation.

Sierra has now raised $635 million altogether, including $110 million that closed in February of last year led by Sequoia and Benchmark, and a $175 million round that closed in October of last year led by Greenoaks.

Others of its investors include ICONIQ and Thrive Capital.

As TechCrunch has previously reported, Taylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other consumer-facing products.

Taylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook’s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he’d oversee the Twitter board throughout Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media site.
