<p>It's been 40 years to the day since the Nintendo Entertainment System made its US debut, and to celebrate, gaming accessory maker 8BitDo has unveiled a line of NES-themed products. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary/"><ins>NES40 collection</ins></a> includes a limited edition version of the company's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/"><ins>Ultimate 2 controller</ins></a> that comes with an NES Retro Receiver, so it can be used with the classic console. There's also the NES-inspired <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/"><ins>Retro Cube 2</ins></a> speaker and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/"><ins>Retro 68 Keyboard</ins></a>, the latter of which sports a full aluminum alloy build and an eye-watering $500 price tag. All are available for pre-order now.</p> 
<p>The Ultimate 2 controller is one of our favorite controllers <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html"><ins>for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</ins></a>, and the NES40 version comes with all the same features, including TMR joysticks, Hall Effect triggers with mode switching and lots of customization options. But with this one, you also get the NES Retro Receiver (a transparent black version that's exclusive to this drop), four custom joystick caps and a robot keychain that pays homage to Nintendo's R.O.B. toy robot. The controller set costs $80 and will ship November 18. It's compatible with Switch 1, 2 and Windows, as well as the original NES using the receiver accessory.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The Retro 68 Keyboard is 8BitDo's first 68-key keyboard, and it's made entirely of aluminum alloy. That includes the shell, keycaps and buttons, according to the company. It uses Kailh Box Ice Cream Pro Max switches. The keyboard features the NES colorway (like its similar, much less expensive <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/8bitdos-nintendo-inspired-mechanical-keyboard-has-super-buttons-just-begging-to-be-mashed-150024778.html"><ins>Retro Mechanical Keyboard</ins></a>) and comes with programmable wireless dual Super Buttons. 8BitDo says it gets up to 300 usage hours on a charge thanks to its 6500mAh battery. It's compatible with Windows and Android, and is expected to ship in January 2026.</p>

<p>The Retro Cube 2 speaker isn't just a cosmetic update to the original Cube Speaker, but brings some improvements in battery life and functionality too. The dual-speaker system has three connection modes — Bluetooth, 2.4G wireless and wired USB — and comes with a charging dock. It has a 2000mAh battery that gets up to 30 hours of use between charges. Like the earlier version, it has D-pad controls for volume, playback and pairing. The $50 speaker ships on December 12.</p>
