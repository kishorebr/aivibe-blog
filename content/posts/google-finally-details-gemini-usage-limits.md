<p class="has-text-align-none">Until very recently it wasn’t clear what usage limits were placed on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065553/google-gemini-ios-android-app-duet-bard">Gemini</a> at the various tiers. Thankfully Google has finally updated its Help Center article detailing “<a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805">Gemini Apps limits &amp; upgrades for Google AI subscribers</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gone are the useless descriptors like “limited access” or vague statements like “we may at times have to cap the number of prompts and conversations you can have, or how much you can use some features, within a specific timeframe.” Instead it clearly states that you get up to five prompts a day with Gemini 2.5 Pro on a free account, 100 with an AI Pro plan, or 500 with AI Ultra. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Free accounts are also limited to five Deep Research reports and 100 generated images a day. If you need to make more than 100 AI generated images in a day, A: For what? B: Upgrading to a Pro or Ultra account will get you 1,000 images. You can check out the full breakdown <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805">here</a>.</p>
