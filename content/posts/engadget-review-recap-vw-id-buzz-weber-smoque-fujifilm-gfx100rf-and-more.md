<p>We're really covering all the bases with our latest slate of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/">reviews</a>. We've got everything from an EV family hauler to a smart pellet grill. Wireless earbuds, a unique camera and a GPU that's actually affordable are also on the list. Plus, there are new Playdate games and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Virtual_private_network" data-original-link="">VPN</a> review if you're into those things. Whatever your preferred flavor, read on for a recap of our reviews from the last two weeks.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vw-idbuzz">VW ID.Buzz</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="697f2000e9604121a27a2ccd36369306" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.vw.com/en/models/id-buzz.html"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>There really isn't an electric minivan available in the US, although the VW ID.Buzz certainly comes close. The EV is definitely a head turner, and it offers loads of cargo space for both passengers and packages. "It's just a shame that it's held back by some obvious issues," <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review-finally-a-powerful-350-gpu-130037952.html">senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar said</a>. "The ID.Buzz is still undeniably useful though, especially if you don't plan on taking many road trips, so there's a chance it'll become more compelling as its price falls."</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-weber-smoque">Weber Smoque</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="e8eec282461640afb185d9d0a5d6bcbd" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.weber.com/US/en/wood-pellet/weber-smoque/weber-smoque/1500770.html"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Wi-Fi-equipped pellet grills can get very expensive very quickly. Thankfully, two of the biggest names in grilling chose to offer affordable models as part of their 2025 lineups. One of those is Weber, and the company's new Smoque pellet grill provides reliable performance alongside all of the features most backyard pit masters will ever need — for $799. "Weber really hit its stride with pellet grills last year with the Searwood, and the Smoque is proof the company has more compelling ideas in the hopper," <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/weber-smoque-review-a-simplified-smart-grill-thats-still-a-workhorse-160023349.html">I wrote</a>. "Thankfully, this one saves you some money without sacrificing any of the culinary results."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-fujifilm-gfx100rf">Fujifilm GFX100RF</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="849676f4589a40b4b4fd084da1673692" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1884991-REG/fujifilm_16938065_gfx100_rangefinder_camera.html"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The GFX100RF may be a world's first, according to Fujifilm, but the camera isn't without a few substantial flaws. Despite a great design, sharp image quality and new controls, this model isn't good for low-light situations, has subpar autofocus and doesn't offer any image stabilization. As senior reporter Steve Dent noted, maybe the GFX100RF has a higher calling. "The GFX100RF is fun to use, though, and introduces several innovations like the aspect ratio dial," <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilm-gfx100rf-review-a-powerful-and-fun-camera-thats-far-from-perfect-133034384.html">he said</a>. "Though it may never have a huge market, I think products like this push the industry in new directions and create conversations that draw new people into photography."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt">AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="74babd74955e4d82b05dd84dbbe1857a" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/9000-series/amd-radeon-rx-9060xt.html"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Upgrading your GPU these days isn't typically an affordable task, but AMD has a $350 option that's a solid bet for most users. "The Radeon RX 9060 XT is a reminder of a world where we didn’t have to pay more than $400 to get a capable GPU," <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review-finally-a-powerful-350-gpu-130037952.html">Devindra explained</a>. "So for the vast majority of players out there — the ones who aren’t using monitors with crazy high refresh rates or 4K+ resolutions — it’s all the GPU you really need."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-two-sets-of-midrange-earbuds-skullcandy-and-sony">Two sets of midrange earbuds: Skullcandy and Sony</h2> 
<p>If you're looking for a set of wireless earbuds for under $150, we recently reviewed two options in that price range. First, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/skullcandy-method-360-anc-review-a-cheaper-version-of-boses-best-earbuds-with-a-few-key-sacrifices-130047025.html">Skullcandy's Method 360 ANC</a> borrows heavily from Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, although officially it only features "sound by Bose." However, Senior buying advice reporter Jeff Dunn warns against the expectation of flagship quality performance. "This is still a tier above most budget pairs we’ve tested," he said. "It has nearly all the features we’re looking for (unlike, say, the Beats Solo Buds), it’s comfortable and the sound signature will hit right if you’re hungry for bass."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sony is best known for its 1000X line of earbuds and headphones, but the company has struck gold a few times with midrange devices. Its latest, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-c710n-review-more-than-midrange-180018400.html">the WF-C710N</a>, has a comfy design and a lot of features for $120. However, sound quality is where you'll notice the biggest difference between it and more expensive options. "If I had been able to hit (or even surpass) Sony’s stated battery life, these earbuds would be easy to recommend," I wrote. "Despite that, they’re still a solid option, especially at $120, since the company once again outpaces its midrange rivals with more convenient tools than you’ll find anywhere else."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-playdate-season-2-and-testing-expressvpn">Playdate Season 2 and testing ExpressVPN</h2> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-fulcrum-defender-dig-dig-dino-and-blippo-140036697.html">Playdate Season 2</a> will deliver two new games per week for the handheld through July 3. Weekend editor Cheyenne Macdonald has already played the first two entries, <em>Fulcrum Defender</em> and <em>Dig! Dig! Dino!, </em>and a third title that Panic also released called <em>Blippo+. </em>Meanwhile, senior writer Sam Chapman tested <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">ExpressVPN</a>, observing how the service outpaces much of the competition despite its lack of customization options and its higher price.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-vw-idbuzz-weber-smoque-fujifilm-gfx100rf-and-more-133047923.html?src=rss
