<p>We have some great news for fans of rhythm games. <em>Ratatan</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamespress.com/Ratatan-Early-Access-Release-Date-Officially-Announced"><ins>hits Steam early access on September 19</ins></a>. This is a spiritual successor to one of the most renowned rhythm games of all time, <em>Patapon</em>. The designer behind the original game, Hiroyuki Kotani, is involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mechanics here are similar to <em>Patapon</em> and its sequels, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ratatan-demands-your-attention-rhythmically-160048067.html"><ins>but look to be more elaborate</ins></a>. The game tasks players with rhythmically controlling cute little soldiers called Cobuns, but directing these warriors while avoiding damage is easier said than done. We said it felt like &quot;the gaming equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>The developer also announced some new features coming to the game. It revealed two new worlds, including a jungle and a garden that&#39;s been frozen over, along with new soldier and weapon types. This is 2025, so the game also features a roguelike element, as players can encounter unique power-ups and buffs during each run.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a lot we don&#39;t know about this title, including the price and when it&#39;ll eventually come to gaming consoles. The developer has a livestream planned for September 14 hosted by voice actor Tomokazu Sugita. The stream &quot;will feature the latest updates, our post-launch roadmap and information on upcoming events.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Patapon</em> originally came out all the way back in 2007 for the PSP. It was followed by a handful of sequels, all originally for Sony&#39;s first portable console. The first two games have been ported to other consoles, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/patapon-1--2-replay-brings-two-psp-classics-to-pc-ps5-and-switch-on-july-11-143627055.html"><ins>including the Switch and PS5</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ratatan-a-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-hits-early-access-on-september-19-171119266.html?src=rss
