<p>After Microsoft decided to jack up the price of its Xbox Game Pass subscriptions to up to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">$30 a month</a>, it has another unwelcome surprise for members. In a statement provided to multiple outlets like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-removes-dlc-discounts-for-xbox-game-pass-members/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed it has removed the discounts for DLC that come with a Game Pass subscription, replacing them by offering points for its Rewards program.</p>
<p>While initial reports discovered the change with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">Call of Duty franchise</a>, the Microsoft statement later clarified that this major shift isn&#39;t &quot;specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases.&quot; To replace the discount, Ultimate subscribers will get 10 percent of their purchase back in Rewards points, while Premium members get five percent, when buying qualifying games from the Game Pass library.</p>

In the same post, Microsoft announced that it would add 45 more games, along with introducing the $10 price hike. With this latest move, Game Pass subscribers even lose out on the immediate 10 percent discount from their purchases and are forced to accept Game Pass store credit instead. This barrage of news has some members questioning their <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/how-to-cancel-or-downgrade-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription-191801458.html">Xbox Game Pass subscription</a>, but there are still ways to secure the previous rate with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/you-can-still-get-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-20-a-month-by-buying-pre-paid-codes-222333599.html">pre-paid codes</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-sneakily-drops-dlc-discounts-that-come-with-xbox-game-pass-160512977.html?src=rss
