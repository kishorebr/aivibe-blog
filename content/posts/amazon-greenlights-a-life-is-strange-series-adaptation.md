<p>With Hollywood video game adaptations surging, it was only a matter of time before <em>Life is Strange</em> got the treatment. After all, even <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-fun-safe-romp-135146207.html">platformer</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-its-good-actually-190035499.html">sandbox game</a> adaptations have (shockingly) found success in this new era. A well-written adventure game seems like a much shorter leap. Amazon <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/amazon-mgm-studios-orders-ilife-is-strangei-to-ser">announced</a> on Friday that Prime Video has ordered a series based on the 2015 game.</p>
<p>Like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-14-life-is-strange-ambiguous-young-love-among-leading-ladies.html">Don&#39;t Nod&#39;s classic</a>, the series will blend angsty teenage realism with supernatural elements and moral choices. And Amazon&#39;s teaser synopsis points to a familiar storyline. &quot;The story follows Max, a photography student, who discovers she can rewind time while saving the life of her childhood best friend, Chloe,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;As she struggles to understand this new skill, the pair investigate the mysterious disappearance of a fellow student, uncovering a dark side to their town that will ultimately force them to make an impossible life-or-death choice that will impact them forever.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>British writer and actor Charlie Covell (<em>End of the F***ing World</em>, <em>KAOS</em>) will chart the series&#39; creative course. They&#39;ll serve as creator, executive producer and showrunner. Story Kitchen&#39;s Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson will executive produce the show. Square Enix and LuckyChap are all part of the project, too. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/jennifer-salke-steps-down-as-head-of-amazon-mgm-studios-161856700.html">Amazon MGM Studios</a> will produce it.</p>

<p>Covell wants the series to appeal to both newcomers and fans of the games. &quot;It&#39;s a huge honor to be adapting <em>Life Is Strange</em> for Amazon MGM Studios,&quot; they said in Amazon&#39;s press release. &quot;I am a massive fan of the game, and I&#39;m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can&#39;t wait to share Max and Chloe&#39;s story with fellow players and new audiences alike.&quot;</p>
