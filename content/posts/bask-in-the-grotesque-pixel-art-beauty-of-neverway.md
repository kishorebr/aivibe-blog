<p><em>Neverway</em> already looks, sounds and feels like it&#39;s going to be something special — in a grim, grotesque and hellishly depressed kind of way. (Side note: That could be a nice tagline, no? <em>It&#39;s grim! It&#39;s grotesque! It&#39;s hellishly depressed! It&#39;s... Neverway!</em> OK, I&#39;ll stop.)</p>
<p><em>Neverway </em>is a life-sim RPG starring Fiona, a young woman who quits her dead-end job to live on a remote island farm for a while, where she ends up becoming the immortal herald of a dead god. Fiona has to fight through nightmare realms and battle repulsive horrors, while also tending her land and maintaining relationships with townsfolk. She&#39;s able to meet and date more than 10 distinct characters, and forming friendship bonds unlocks combat abilities. The game features farming and fishing mechanics, and there&#39;s also a crafting system for secondary tools like the hookshot, which supplements Fiona&#39;s primary weapon, a sword.</p>

<p><em>Neverway</em> comes from Coldblood Inc., an independent Vancouver studio founded by Brazilian-Canadian developers Pedro Medeiros and Isadora Sophia. Medeiros is the pixel artist behind <em>Towerfall</em> and <em>Celeste</em>, two stunning indie games, and Sophia is an ex-senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/microsoft/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Microsoft" data-original-link="">Microsoft</a> and the creator of the open-source <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder">Murder Engine</a>, which powers <em>Neverway</em>. The game also features music by Disasterpiece, the composer behind <em>Fez</em> and the top-tier horror film <em>It Follows</em>, with sound design by Martin Kvale of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.noknokaudio.com/">NokNok Audio</a>.
