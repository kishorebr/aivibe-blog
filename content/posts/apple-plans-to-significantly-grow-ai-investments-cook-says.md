Apple on Thursday signaled that it’s getting more serious about its plans to catch up in the AI race. 

“We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments,” CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2025 earnings call with investors. “Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy,” he added.


	
	




	
	



Cook expanded on those comments on the call, noting that Apple was “reallocating a fair number of people” to focus on AI. 

“We have a great, great team and we’re putting all of our energy behind it,” he added.

AI investments are also driving increased CapEx spending, which was up year-to-date, the company said. However, Apple pointed out that it still employed a hybrid model where it relies on third parties to make capital investments, which is why the figure won’t grow exponentially. 

Ahead of its call, the company shared in an interview with CNBC that it’s open to M&A to accelerate its roadmap. The company told the outlet that it has already acquired seven companies this year. None was “huge” in terms of dollar amount, Cook said.

On the call, he added that Apple was making acquisitions at the rate of one every several weeks.
