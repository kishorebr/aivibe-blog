<p>Four years after Amazon’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-acquires-wondery-182737211.html"><ins>acquisition of podcast network Wondery</ins></a>, the tech giant is dismantling its $300 million purchase and reorganizing various audio properties into separate teams at the company. As first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/amazon-to-shut-down-wondery-podcast-studio-reorganize-audio-business"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, this reorg will see the studio lose about 110 employees, and CEO Jen Sargent is departing the company.</p>
<p>Amazon told <em>Bloomberg</em> it will continue to produce podcasts, though their place within the company will be restructured. The more narrative-focused podcasts under the Wondery brand, such as <em>American Scandal</em> and <em>Business Wars</em>, will merge with Amazon’s Audible team. Some of these podcasts will retain Wondery branding, and the Wondery Plus app will remain active. Subscribers to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://wondery.com/plus/"><ins>Wondery Plus</ins></a> get early access to some podcast episodes through the app, though it&#39;s unclear at this point what functionalities will remain in the app, and which will be absorbed by Audible.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the celebrity-hosted shows such as <em>New Heights</em> with Jason and Travis Kelce and <em>Armchair Expert</em> with Dax Shepard will be rolled into a new team that Amazon is calling Creator Services. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, a main focus of this new team will be selling large sponsorships. These titles are part of a growing trend toward video podcasts that have helped make <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube-passes-1-billion-monthly-active-podcast-viewers-225223309.html"><ins>YouTube the go-to platform</ins></a> for podcast consumption.</p>
<p>Steve Boom, VP for Audio, Twitch and Games at Amazon, addressed the changes <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/amazon-reorganizes-audio-wondery-layoffs-podcasts-1236477817/"><ins>in a memo</ins></a> (published by <em>Deadline</em>) sent to Amazon employees. &quot;The podcast landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years. As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared with audio-first, narrative series,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Employees who were let go as part of these changes were notified Monday, though Amazon spokesperson Alice Zhou told <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718136/amazon-wondery-gutting-podcast-studio-layoffs"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> that &quot;many of the impacted employees&quot; would be moved to &quot;other parts of Amazon.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-splits-up-the-wondery-podcast-network-and-lays-off-about-110-employees-185358357.html?src=rss
