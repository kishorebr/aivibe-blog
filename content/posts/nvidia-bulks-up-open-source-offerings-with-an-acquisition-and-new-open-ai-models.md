Nvidia continues to expand its footprint in open source AI on two fronts: an acquisition and a new model release.

The semiconductor giant announced Monday it acquired SchedMD, the leading developer of popular open source workload management system Slurm. Nvidia said the company will continue to operate the program, which is designed for high-performance computing and AI, as an open source, vendor-neutral software.


	
	




	
	



Slurm was originally launched in 2002 and SchedMD was founded in 2010 by the lead Slurm developers Morris Jette and Danny Auble. Auble is the current CEO of SchedMD.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Nvidia declined to comment on the news beyond the company’s blog post.

Nvidia has been working with SchedMD for more than a decade and said in its blog post the technology is critical infrastructure for generative AI. The company plans to keep investing in the technology and “accelerate” its access to different systems.

The semiconductor company also released a new family of open AI models on Monday. The company claimed this group of models, called Nvidia Nemotron 3, is the most “efficient family of open models” for building accurate AI agents.

This model family includes the Nemotron 3 Nano, a small model for targeted tasks, the Nemotron 3 Super, a model built for multi-AI agent applications, and Nemotron 3 Ultra, built for more complicated tasks.
