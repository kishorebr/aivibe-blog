<p>Six years after the announcement of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-atari-themed-gaming-hotels.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">plans to build Atari Hotels</a> in eight cities across the US, including Las Vegas, only one now seems to be moving forward, in Phoenix, Arizona.
