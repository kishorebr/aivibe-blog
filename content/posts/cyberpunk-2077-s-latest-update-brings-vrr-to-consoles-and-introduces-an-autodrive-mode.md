<p>There&#39;s another big update for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> coming our way. Update 2.3 brings some <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">notable new features</a> to PC and consoles. CD Projekt Red (CDPR) is adding official in-game support for VRR on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. This should help with screen tearing when the frame rate drops and is of particular use when running the game in performance mode.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also an official AutoDrive feature, which is something that has long-existed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14680?tab=files">in the modding community</a>. This is available in all cars and motorcycles and lets players drive from place to place automatically. Just set the destination marker and let the game do the rest. This isn&#39;t teleportation. The vehicle still drives, it does just so automatically.</p>

<p>With AutoDrive enabled, players can turn on a &quot;cinematic camera&quot; to make the journey a bit more visually stimulating. There&#39;s even a new &quot;wandering&quot; mode for aimless joyrides, for those who just want to experience the splendor of Night City and its environs.</p>
<p>Speaking of driving, the update also brings four additional vehicles to the game, and they all look to be attached to new side jobs. More content is always appreciated.</p>
<p>PC players are getting support for AMD FSR 3.1, Intel XeSS 2.0 and HDR 10 Plus. AMD&#39;s FSR 4 is also being added, but it requires a specialized driver that isn&#39;t available yet. CDPR says it&#39;s coming at a &quot;later date.&quot;</p>

It looks like the Mac version will include these new features. Update 2.3 is coming to the Switch 2, but not just yet. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/cyberpunk-2077-and-split-fiction-are-third-party-launch-titles-for-nintendo-switch-2-135648661.html">was a launch title</a> for the recently-released console.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-update-brings-vrr-to-consoles-and-introduces-an-autodrive-mode-181933646.html?src=rss
