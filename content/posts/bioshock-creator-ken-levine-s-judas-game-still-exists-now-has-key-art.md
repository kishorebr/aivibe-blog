<p>Remember <em>Judas</em>? No, not the biblical figure and not the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wagn8Wrmzuc">Lady Gaga bop</a>, this <em>Judas</em> is a project from Ghost Story Games. If you don&#39;t remember, it&#39;s the game that was reportedly in &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil"><ins>development hell</ins></a>&quot; before it was even <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ken-levine-judas-trailer-the-game-awards-ghost-story-games-015100018.html"><ins>announced</ins></a>. The team, led by <em>BioShock</em> creator Ken Levine, had gone pretty quiet for a few years after releasing the debut trailer, but today teased a look at some key art and mechanics for the game.</p>
<p>The <em>BioShock</em> lineage is clear from the handful of visuals we&#39;ve seen so far, but instead of a linear binary of which NPCs and actions are good versus bad, <em>Judas</em> aims to place the moral compass more firmly in the player&#39;s hands. There are a trio of major characters, dubbed the Big 3 in today&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/"><ins>devlog</ins></a>, who will be drawn to the player based on what you do in-game. If one of the main NPCs gets ignored for too long, they&#39;ll become the game&#39;s villain. This unlocks new sets of powers and abilities for them that could also influence your gameplay options.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For instance, there are Rent-A-Deputy stations where the player can temporarily access a weirdly wiggly ally to help them in fights. However, if you&#39;ve alienated Tom, the old-school sheriff character, Rent-A-Deputies will attack you instead.</p>
<p>The emphasis here seems to be on building relationships with the Big 3, and the gist seems to be that at some point, you&#39;ll have to decide which one will be your real enemy. Unsurprisingly, the team has no release date to share yet. Maybe in another couple of yearsâ€¦</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-game-still-exists-now-has-key-art-201635885.html?src=rss
