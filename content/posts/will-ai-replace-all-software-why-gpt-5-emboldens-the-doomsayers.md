This could enable corporations that buy software from packaged software vendors to create all their code internally and stop paying the software vendors.(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)Also: AI agents will match 'good mid-level' engineers this year, says Mark ZuckerbergSpeculation has been fueled by the views of tech's biggest players, including Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, who in January
