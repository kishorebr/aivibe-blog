<p>When Meta first announced its display-enabled smart glasses last year, it teased a handwriting feature that allows users to send messages by tracing letters with their hands. Now, the company is starting to <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=82355909-2fe4-4eae-b967-7199d226403b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=roll+it+out&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUL9gKSpBZpUFr2WD-jS6B_qW1vCAEjyWs1MDfO8KPbL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fces-2026-meta-ray-ban-display-teleprompter-emg-handwriting-garmin-unified-cabin-university-of-utah-tetraski%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/blog/ces-2026-meta-ray-ban-display-teleprompter-emg-handwriting-garmin-unified-cabin-university-of-utah-tetraski/">roll it out</a>, with people enrolled in its early access program getting it first,</p><p>I got a chance to try the feature at CES and it made me want to start wearing my Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses more often. When I <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reviewed</a> the glasses last year, I wrote about how one of&nbsp; my favorite tings about the neural band is that it reduced my reliance on voice commands. I&#39;ve always felt a bit self conscious at speaking to my glasses in public.&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, replying to messages on the display glasses has still generally required voice dictation or generic preset replies. But handwriting means that you can finally send custom messages and replies somewhat discreetly.&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting at a table wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and neural band, I was able to quickly write a message just by drawing the letters on the table in front of me. It wasn&#39;t perfect — it misread a capital &quot;I&quot; as an &quot;H&quot; — but it was surprsingly intuitive. I was able to quickly trace out a short sentence and even correct a typo (a swipe from left to right will let you add a space, while a swipe from right to left deletes the last character).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ9IsB72nVk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Alongside handwriting, Meta also announced a new teleprompter feature. Copy and paste a bunch of text — it supports up to 16,000 characters (roughly a half-hour&#39;s worth of speech) — and you can beam your text into the glasses&#39; display.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever used a teleprompter, Meta&#39;s version works a bit differently in that the text doesn&#39;t automatically scroll while you speak. Instead, the text is displayed on individual cards you manually swipe through. The company told me it originally tested a scrolling version, but that in early tests, people said they preferred to be in control of when the words appeared in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Teleprompter is starting to roll out now, though Meta says it could take some time before everyone is able to access.&nbsp;</p><p>The updates are the among the first major additions Meta has made to its display glasses since launching them late last year and a sign that, like its other smart glasses, the company plans to keep them fresh with new features.
