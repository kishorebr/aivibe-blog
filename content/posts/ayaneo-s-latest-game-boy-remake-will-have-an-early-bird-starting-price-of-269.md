<p>After the high price tag of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneos-latest-handhelds-are-inspired-by-the-game-boy-and-gb-micro-163412607.html">Ayaneo Pocket DMG</a> turned some retro handheld fans away, Ayaneo is working on another remake of the classic Game Boy with a slightly more affordable cost. Ayaneo revealed the pricing for the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/908">Pocket Vert</a>, which starts at $269 for early bird orders.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/goods/9003564794101">Pocket DMG</a> that retails for $449, Ayaneo skipped the OLED and configurations that go up to 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage for the Pocket Vert. Instead, the handheld maker went with a fully metal CNC body and an ultra-minimalist design with engraving-free buttons that resemble the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011-150056369.html">Analogue Pocket</a>&#39;s look. Ayaneo built the Pocket Vert with a smaller 3.5-inch LCD screen that has a 1,600 x 1,440 resolution and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip that should allow the handheld to handle anything up to PS2 and some Nintendo Switch games.</p>

<p>To play more modern games, the Pocket Vert has a hidden touch pad below the buttons that acts as a makeshift joystick. Ayaneo also hid a fingerprint sensor in the power button and included a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot for more storage capacity. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/ayaneo/ayaneo-pocket-vertcreate-a-top-of-the-line-gadget-for-vertical-retro-handheld-gamers">Indiegogo campaign</a> for the Pocket Vert isn&#39;t open yet, but it will be the only place to snag the latest vertical handheld from Ayaneo at its lowest price before it reverts to the retail price of $339. You can even opt for the fully specced-out version that&#39;s only available in Lava Red and has 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage for an early bird price of $369 and a later standard price of $439.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-game-boy-remake-will-have-an-early-bird-starting-price-of-269-174553644.html?src=rss
