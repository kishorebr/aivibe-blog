<p>NetEase, the Chinese video game company that published <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/marvel-rivals-team-hit-with-layoffs-despite-huge-success-of-game-133002120.html"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> and Bungie&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/destiny-rising-is-bungies-new-mobile-game-published-by-netease-games-163054704.html"><em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, has announced its first single-player AAA game. It&#39;s a story-driven third-person action-adventure game called <em>Blood Message</em>, and as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/608227/blood-message-trailer-netease-announcement"><em>Polygon</em></a> notes, it&#39;s in the vein of <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed.</em> The story is set in the final years of the Tang Dynasty, which ruled imperial China from 618 to 907. In <em>Blood Message</em>, players take control of a nameless messenger and his son &quot;to deliver a message that holds the fate of their war-torn homeland.&quot;</p>
<p>Players will have to journey through desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia. The trailer shows the messenger and his son fighting enemies in the desert, surviving avalanches, working with mysterious characters and discovering ancient artifacts. It also shows the game&#39;s cinematic cutscenes, stealth and survival mechanics, as well as the landscapes players can expect to see.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message,&quot; said Zhipeng Hu, the Lead Producer and NetEase Executive Vice President. &quot;As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>NetEase has yet to announce a release date, but <em>Blood Message</em> will be available for consoles and the PC. The game&#39;s announcement shows that Chinese developers are increasingly making more inroads into the AAA space. <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/black-myth-wukong-is-getting-an-xbox-port-on-august-20-133100514.html"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>, which is widely considered as the first AAA game from China, was originally released last year and will be available on the Xbox in August.&nbsp;</p>
