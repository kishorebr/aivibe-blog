<p>YouTube has started a renewed effort to integrate direct messaging into its platform. According to a support <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&amp;msgid=388556429" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">page</a>, the service has started testing DMs as a way for users to share and discuss videos. The test is for users aged 18 and up in Ireland and Poland. But while a DM usually comes with some expectation of privacy, Google noted that &quot;messages may be reviewed to ensure they follow our Community Guidelines.&quot;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the video platform&#39;s first attempt to provide a messaging angle. YouTube <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-07-youtube-direct-sharing-messaging-android-ios-app.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">added</a> DMs to its app in 2017, then <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-youtube-killing-direct-messaging.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">removed</a> the feature in 2019 in order to emphasize public conversations in comments sections. The new test for sharing within YouTube&#39;s ecosystem won&#39;t mean any change to other ways you might send people videos. Re-introducing the same system six years after cutting it seems like an odd choice, but Google claims this is &quot;a top feature request,&quot; so maybe it&#39;ll get a broader adoption this time around.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-is-once-again-trying-to-make-dms-happen-205724221.html?src=rss
