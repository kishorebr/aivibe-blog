<p class="has-text-align-none">Gemini can now draw from your emails and documents while performing “deep research” queries. Google’s <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-workspace-app-integration/">announcement blog</a> called this “one of our most-requested features” for <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/">Gemini Deep Research</a>, which is an agentic feature styled specifically for creating research reports rather than just answering questions. The chatbot starts by creating a multi-step research plan, then it performs a series of web searches to create a report that you can ask it to tweak with additional info, or export the whole thing into a Google Doc or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634117/google-gemini-ai-podcast-audio-overviews-deep-research">AI-generated podcast</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google says of the new connection between Deep Research and Workspace products:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now you can start a market analysis for a new product by having Deep Research analyze your team&#8217;s initial brainstorming docs, related email threads and project plans. Or you can build a competitor report about a rival product that cross-references public web data with your strategies, comparison spreadsheets and team chats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once “deep research” is selected on the Gemini’s prompt bar, users can pick which of the four options they want Gemini to use: a regular Google Search, Gmail, Drive, and/or Chat. That means that your emails in Gmail, your docs, slides, sheets, and PDFs in Drive, and your chatlogs — if you use Google Chat — will provide context for Google’s AI model.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, it’s only on desktop, but Google says it’ll soon start rolling out to mobile in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>
