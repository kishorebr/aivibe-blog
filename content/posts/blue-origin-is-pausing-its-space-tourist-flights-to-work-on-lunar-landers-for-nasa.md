<p>Blue Origin plans to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-to-pause-flights" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">put a focus</a> on the development of its human lunar capabilities, so it won’t be sending tourists to space for at least the next two years. That means we won’t be seeing any New Shepard launches for quite some time. Blue Origin is one of the companies NASA chose to develop human landing systems for its Artemis program, along with SpaceX. Specifically, it will work on landers for the Artemis III and Artemis V missions. </p><p>The company was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">originally contracted</a> to build the human landing system that would transfer astronauts from NASA’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-lunar-gateway-launch-contract-231142514.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Gateway</a> station to the moon’s South Pole region for the Artemis V mission.

Artemis III is expected to be the first crewed moon landing mission of the program, and the Trump administration wants it to happen before the end of the president’s term. </p><p>New Shepard takes tourists to suborbital space, where they experience a few minutes of weightlessness before the spacecraft makes its way back to Earth.
