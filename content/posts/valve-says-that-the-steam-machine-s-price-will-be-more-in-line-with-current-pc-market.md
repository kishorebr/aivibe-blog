<p>Valve shook up the gaming world with the announcement of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html">Steam Machine</a>, but we&#39;re all still curious about the million-dollar question of pricing. While there&#39;s plenty of speculation, we finally have some sort of indication from Valve directly. In an interview with Skill Up&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Valve&#39;s Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that the Steam Machine will not be subsidized but will still have competitive pricing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that if you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,&quot; Griffais said on the podcast. &quot;Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance, and then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you’re making your own gaming PC from parts.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Griffais didn&#39;t offer a concrete price range since Valve was still early in the process, adding that &quot;right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is going to be because there’s a lot of different things that are fluctuating.&quot; When asked if the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/for-the-steam-machine-to-change-pc-gaming-valve-must-solve-linuxs-anti-cheat-problem-130000088.html">Steam Machine</a> would be subsidized like how other companies often sell <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-sold-842-million-playstation-5s-since-launch-123004469.html">new consoles</a> at a loss or slim profit margin to generate early momentum, Griffais said no and that it would be &quot;more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Griffais also revealed that Valve is potentially interested in doing a Steam Machine Pro, but that the company is currently focused on this mid-range level as a &quot;good trade off between affordability and the level of power we get.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-says-that-the-steam-machines-price-will-be-more-in-line-with-current-pc-market-182213173.html?src=rss
