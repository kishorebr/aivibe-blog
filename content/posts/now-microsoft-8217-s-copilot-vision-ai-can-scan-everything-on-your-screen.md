<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft is rolling out <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/07/15/copilot-on-windows-vision-desktop-share-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">an update</a> to Copilot Vision for Windows Insiders that lets the AI tool see everything that’s on your screen. Previously, the tool was able to look at two apps at a time and connect the dots between the two, but with this change, it can look at your whole desktop or “any specific browser or app window,” Microsoft says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike Recall, which can automatically take regular snapshots of what’s on your computer screen, using Copilot Vision is more like screen sharing during a video call: you can activate the feature by clicking the glasses icon in the Copilot app and selecting the desktop you want it to see.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Copilot Vision can “help analyze content, provide insights, and answer your questions, coaching you through it aloud,” according to Microsoft. “Get tips on making improvements to your creative project, help with improving your resume, or guidance while navigating a new game.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft initially started testing Copilot Vision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313888/microsoft-copilot-vision-testing-websites">last year</a> as a feature that could see what you’re looking at while browsing the web in Edge. Copilot Vision can also answer questions about what it sees through your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">mobile phone’s camera</a>.</p>
