<p>Here's some light — and revolting! — reading while we wait for the Epstein Files to be released (or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-bondi-sidesteps-questions-about-epstein-files-at-press-conference" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">stonewalled</a>). You can now peruse the Jeffrey Epstein emails, recently released by Congress, in a simulated Gmail account.</p><p>"You're logged in as Jeffrey Epstein," the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://jmail.world/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Jmail website</a> reads. (Ick.) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://lucasigel.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Luke Igel</a>, CEO of Kino, and software engineer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://walzr.com" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Riley Walz</a> collaborated on the project. The latter is one of the creators of the Panama Playlists, which (in a similar light) turned Spotify's lax privacy into <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/spotifys-lax-privacy-means-anyone-can-see-the-vice-presidents-song-choices-123015427.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a website for public figures' "leaked" musical tastes</a>.</p><p>Jmail is about as faithful a recreation of Gmail as you could imagine. Just like a real inbox, the messages are sorted from the most recent, up to the eve of Epstein's 2019 arrest for the sex trafficking of minors. It includes a working search feature.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/epstein_email_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/epstein_email_2.jpg" style="height:1305px;width:2321px;" alt="Screenshot of the Jmail project.

Their revelations put Donald Trump's relationship with the sex trafficker back in the spotlight. The president's name appears many times in the more than 20,000 documents. In one, the late sex offender claimed Trump "knew about the girls."</p><p>In a 2011 email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein said Trump "spent hours at my house" with someone whose name was redacted. (The committee said it was a victim.) In a 2017 thread, Epstein described the current president as "worse in real life and upclose." In 2018, the disgraced financier boasted he was "the one able to take [Trump] down."</p><p>Another public figure who came out looking even worse than before was the Andrew formerly known as "Prince" (Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor). He <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/prince-andrew-told-jeffrey-epstein-were-in-this-together-in-2011-email" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">told</a> Epstein in 2011, "We're in this together." Then there's former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. He stayed in touch with Epstein as recently as 2019, long after the latter's 2008 arrest for soliciting underage sex. In the wake of the email dump, Summers was put on leave from Harvard and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/larry-summers-resigns-openai-board-jeffrey-epstein-emails-rcna244766" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">resigned</a> from OpenAI's board.</p><p>You can check out Jmail at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://jmail.world/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">the project's website</a>.
