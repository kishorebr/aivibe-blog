<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Microsoft’s Stockholm-based King division, famous for <em>Candy Crush</em>, is laying off 10 percent of its staff, representing roughly 200 jobs. While some other European gaming offices are also cutting, US units are reportedly being informed later Wednesday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, sent an email to all Microsoft Gaming employees regarding the layoffs, which was obtained by <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025"><em>Windows Central</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and confirmed as authentic by Microsoft. In it, Spencer said, "I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities."</p>
<p>Here's Phil Spencer's full note to staff:</p>
<div class="breakout-box"><p><em>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</em></p>
<p><em>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</em></p>
<p><em>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</em></p>
<p><em>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</em></p>

<p>As part of today's layoffs, several games, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs-162200526.html">including Rare's <em>Everwild</em></a>, have been cancelled and The Initiative, the Xbox studio which was producing the Perfect Dark reboot, has been <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html">shut down</a>. The news was broken to the team by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, who said Microsoft "did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p>
<p>Here's Matt Booty's full note to staff:</p>
<div class="breakout-box"><p><em>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.</em></p>
<p><em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</em></p>
<p><em>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p>
<p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</em></p>
<p><em>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead.</em></p>

<p>Last year, Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-slashes-1900-jobs-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard-145304693.html">slashed almost 2,000 jobs</a> from its gaming division, affecting employees across Xbox and Activision Blizzard. In the same year, it also <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-have-been-shut-down-183913558.html">shuttered a trio</a> of ZeniMax game development teams after having <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html">acquired</a> the video game holding company in 2021. This will be the fourth round of cuts at Xbox in the last 18 months. These layoffs come against the backdrop of Microsoft’s <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html">$69 billion acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard in October 2023.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has had a rocky couple of years, with an <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html">estimated</a> 11 percent of game developers losing their jobs in 2024. Microsoft’s profits have been on a steady upward trajectory, with the company reporting over $25 billion in net income in its last quarterly report. When asked for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson told Engadget that the company "[continues] to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace.”</p>
<p><strong>Update, July 2, 6:45PM ET: </strong>This story has been updated multiple times since publishing to include confirmation of the particulars of the layoffs, the cancellation of several games, the shuttering of The Initiative, and an infuriatingly vague comment from a Microsoft spokesperson.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html?src=rss
