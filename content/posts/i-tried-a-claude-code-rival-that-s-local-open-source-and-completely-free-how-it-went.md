    I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it went
     
    I was curious if Block's Goose agent, paired with Ollama and the Qwen3-coder model, could really replace Claude Code. Here's how it worked.

ZDNET's key takeaways Free AI tools Goose and Qwen3-coder may replace a pricey Claude Code plan.Setup is straightforward but requires a powerful local machine.Early tests show promise, though issues remain with accuracy and retries.Jack Dorsey is the founder of Twitter (now X), Square (now Block), and Bluesky (still blue). Back in July, he posted a fairly cryptic statement on X, saying "goose + qwen3-coder = wow".Also: Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's freeSince then, interest has grown in both Goose and Qwen3-coder. Goose, developed by Dorsey's company Block, is an open-source agent framework, similar to Claude Code. Qwen3-coder is a coding-centric large language model similar to Sonnet-4.5. Both are free.Together, suggests the internet, they can combine to create a fully free competitor to Claude Code. But can they? Really? I decided to find out. Also: I used Claude Code to vibe code a Mac app in 8 hours, but it was more work than magicThis is the first of three articles that will discuss the integration of Goose (the agent framework), Ollama (an LLM server), and Qwen3-coder (the LLM).  In this article, I'll show you how to get everything working. In the next article, I'll give you a more in-depth understanding of the roles each of these three tools plays in the AI agent coding process. And then, finally, I'll attempt to use these tools to build a fully po
