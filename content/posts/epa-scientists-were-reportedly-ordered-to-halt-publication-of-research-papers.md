<p>According to a report by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/20/epa-scientists-research-publications/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, scientists with the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Office of Water were ordered by &quot;political appointees&quot; to stop work on studies that were headed for publication, as they&#39;ll now be &quot;subject to a new review process.&quot; Staffers were reportedly given the instructions in a town hall meeting this week. The only papers exempt are those for which &quot;scientific journals had already returned proofs — the final step in the academic publication process,&quot; reports <em>The Washington Post</em>, which spoke to two agency employees. Among other things, the role of the Office of Water is to ensure the safety of drinking water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the latest in a string of changes at the EPA under the Trump administration, and raises yet more concerns for public health. In May, the agency announced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/the-epa-is-rolling-back-biden-era-clean-water-rules-130029921.html">plans to roll back limitations</a> for some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; that had been set by the Biden administration, saying it would keep only the limits for the two most common, PFOA and PFOS. In July, the EPA <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-epa-cutting-workforce-by-23-closing-research-division-2025-07-18/">laid off thousands of employees</a> and announced it would shut down its scientific research office. The same month, the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way">EPA proposed</a> rescinding certain greenhouse gas emissions standards, and just last week <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-end-burdensome-costly-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-saving-24">announced a plan</a> to do away with the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program that requires some of the nation&#39;s biggest polluters to report their emissions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the latest orders, staffers with the Office of Water who spoke to <em>The Washington Post</em> said they were not given a reason to provide scientific journals as to why the papers have been halted, and no details on the new review process have been shared. One employee told the publication, &quot;This represents millions of dollars of research, potentially, that’s now being stopped.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/epa-scientists-were-reportedly-ordered-to-halt-publication-of-research-papers-183751436.html?src=rss
