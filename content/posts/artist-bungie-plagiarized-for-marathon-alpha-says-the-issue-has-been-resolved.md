<p>Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment appear to have settled the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungie-admits-its-marathon-alpha-included-stolen-artwork-210006323.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">plagiarism scandal</a> that rocked <em>Marathon</em> before the game was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-delays-marathon-indefinitely-190832450.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">indefinitely delayed</a> in June 2025. Fern Hook, an artist who goes by the name “Antireal” online, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">posted on X</a> that her issues with Bungie using her work without credit in <em>Marathon</em> have been resolved to her &quot;satisfaction.&quot;</p><p><em>Marathon</em>&#39;s distinct art style is one of its charms, but as Hook <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">claimed on X</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Bungie later confirmed</a>, a portion of the assets and textures featured in the game&#39;s alpha were lifted from Hook&#39;s work. At the time, Bungie announced that it was conducting an investigation and hoped to discuss the issue with Hook. It&#39;s not clear what kind of agreement Bungie, Sony and Hook came to, but it appears to have solved any outstanding issues.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.</p>— N² (@4nt1r34l) <a href="https://twitter.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Bungie delayed <em>Marathon</em> from its original September 2025 launch date in June, and more recently ran <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-will-conduct-technical-testing-on-marathon-later-this-month-213422857.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">closed playtests</a> of an updated version of the game in October. As of Sony&#39;s November earnings report, the company now says <em>Marathon </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sony-says-marathon-will-still-release-by-march-2026-pinky-promise-and-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">will launch by March 2026</a>. <em>Marathon</em> is a reimagining of an older Bungie franchise, but more importantly, it&#39;s also the developer&#39;s first new game since <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-13-destiny-2-release-dates-confirmed-for-pc-and-consoles.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> was released in 2017.
