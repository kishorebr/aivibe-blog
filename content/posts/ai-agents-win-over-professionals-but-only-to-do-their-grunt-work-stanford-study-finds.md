But do individual workers actually want to use them?A new study from Stanford University shows the answer may be yes -- as long as they automate mundane tasks and don't encroach too far on human agency.Also: Don't be fooled into thinking AI is coming for your job - here's the truthTitled "Future of Work with AI Agents," the study set out to move beyond hype around AI agents to understand how, exactly, these tools can be practically integrated into the day-to-day routines of professionals. While previous studies have investigated the impact of AI agents on specific job categories, like software engineering and IT, the Stanford researchers analyzed individual categories of tasks, allowing them "to better capture the nuanced, open-ended, and contextual nature of real-world work," they noted in their report.To that end, the researchers adopted a "worker-centric approach," interviewing 1,500 professionals about their preferences for adopting AI agents. They also interviewed AI experts to understand the technology's current realistic applications and limitations.The study helps to bolster previous research, which has shown that the effects of AI automation will vary widely depending on the nature of the work.What did the study find?The survey led to the construction of what the Stanford researchers dubbed the AI Agent Worker Outlook & Readiness Knowledge Bank, or WORKBank, a database reflecting workers' current views on
