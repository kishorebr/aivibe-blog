<p>It&#39;s been nearly a year since DJI <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/dji-challenges-its-chinese-military-company-pentagon-designation-in-court-120036412.html">sued the Department of Defense</a> over its designation as a &quot;Chinese military company.&quot; On Friday, a judge <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/drone-maker-dji-loses-lawsuit-against-pentagon-claim-chinese-military-ties-2025-09-26/">ruled against</a> the drone maker. US District Judge Paul Friedman said the DoD presented enough evidence that DJI contributes to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, DJI acknowledges that its technology can and is used in military conflict but asserts that its policies prohibit such use,&quot; Friedman wrote in his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbvgzenrrpq/DJI%20v%20DOD%20-%20opinion%20-%2020250926.pdf">opinion</a>. &quot;Whether or not DJI&#39;s policies prohibit military use is irrelevant. That does not change the fact that DJI&#39;s technology has both substantial theoretical and actual military application.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DJI challenged the designation in October 2024. It told the court it is &quot;neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military.&quot; The company claimed in its filing that it suffered &quot;ongoing financial and reputational harm&quot; as a result of the inclusion. The designation can prevent companies from accessing grants, contracts, loans and other programs.</p>
<p>The drone maker has a contentious history with the US government. The Department of Commerce <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-entity-list-trade-china-us-commerce-department-171243815.html">added it and 77 other companies</a> to its Entity List in 2020, effectively blocking US businesses from dealing with them. A year later, the Treasury Department included DJI on <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/us-government-china-dji-investment-blocklist-103514525.html">its &quot;Chinese military-industrial complex companies&quot; list</a>. That designation was for its alleged involvement in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/un-expert-concludes-forced-labour-has-taken-place-xinjiang-2022-08-18/">surveillance</a> of Uyghur Muslim people in China. Last year, US customs <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-confirms-that-us-customs-is-holding-up-its-latest-consumer-drone-123007447.html">began holding up DJI&#39;s consumer drones</a> at the border.</p>
<p>The company now faces a potential import ban in the US by the end of this year. The ban was initially scheduled for 2024. But <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-evades-us-ban-but-has-one-year-to-prove-its-products-arent-a-national-security-threat-133042749.html">a clause in the $895 billion US Defense Bill</a> gave it a year to prove that its products don&#39;t pose a national security risk. In March, DJI <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://dronedj.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/dji-letter-drone-audit.pdf">pleaded</a> with five national security agencies (DHS, DoD, FBI, NSA, and ODNI) to begin evaluating its products &quot;right away.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/dji-loses-lawsuit-over-pentagons-chinese-military-company-list-204804617.html?src=rss
