<p>Two directors from <em>MultiVersus</em> are striking out on their own, forming a new, independent game studio. The platform brawler&#39;s production director, Justin Fischer, and technical director, Brock Feldman, have joined forces to launch a new endeavor called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.airlockgames.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Airlock Games</a>. Rather than continuing to follow the AAA route, the first project from Airlock is a sci-fi sim management horror game called <em>What the Stars Forgot</em>. The team plans to run a Kickstarter to generate backing for the game ahead of a planned early access launch in December.</p><p>Player First Games, the studio behind <em>MultiVersus</em>, was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-has-bought-the-developer-behind-its-multiversus-brawler-180355445.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">acquired</a> by WB Games last summer, but despite a promising early showing, the game was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/season-5-of-multiversus-will-be-its-last-154839513.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">shuttered</a> in May at the close of its fifth season.

After so many highly anticipated projects have gotten the axe as a money-saving, cost-cutting decision by large outfits, it makes sense that devs might want to have more control over their own destinies.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra35HZx7lL0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-pair-of-multiversus-directors-are-launching-a-new-game-studio-211118742.html?src=rss
