<p>Corning, the US-based glass manufacturer behind Gorilla Glass, has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/corning-dodges-eu-antitrust-clash-with-gorilla-glass-deal?sref=10lNAhZ9">vowed</a> to end its exclusive deals and other practices that the European Commission deemed to be anti-competitive in order to avoid getting fined. If you&#39;ll recall, the commission <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-eu-is-looking-into-corning-for-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-140328416.html">announced</a> that it was investigating Corning last year, accusing it of squashing competition with its exclusive supply agreements, thereby driving up prices and stifling innovation. Now, the commission has <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/ip_25_1868">accepted</a> the commitments Corning offered and made them legally binding under the EU&#39;s rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the commission announced its investigation, it said Corning required mobile phone manufacturers to source all or nearly all of their Alkali-AS glass (marketed as Gorilla Glass) needs from the company, even ganting them rebates. Under its agreement with the commission, Corning has to &quot;waive all exclusive dealing clauses in all its current agreements&quot; with phone manufacturers and companies that process raw glass. Corning also won&#39;t be allowed to enter exclusive deals in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Corning can&#39;t require manufacturers or any of their suppliers to purchase any quantity of Alkali-AS Glass from it in the European Economic Area. Worldwide, Corning can&#39;t require manufacturers and their suppliers to purchase more than 50 percent of their needs from the company. Corning&#39;s commitment will remain in force for nine years, and a trustee will monitor the company&#39;s movements to ensure its compliance.&nbsp;</p>
