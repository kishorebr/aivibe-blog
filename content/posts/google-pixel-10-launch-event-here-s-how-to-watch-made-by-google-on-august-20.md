<p>Believe it or not, Big Tech&#39;s fall hardware events are already upon us. (Heck, Samsung already <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/galaxy-unpacked-2025-everything-samsung-announced-including-the-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-and-galaxy-watch-8-140023487.html">got a jump on things</a> in July.) Up next: Google&#39;s big Pixel shindig. You can learn all about the new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-new-phones-foldables-and-watches-at-the-made-by-google-event-214510624.html">Pixel 10 lineup</a>, along with new watches and earbuds, on August 20.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s new hardware has leaked far and wide. But that doesn&#39;t mean there couldn&#39;t be a few surprises. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@madebygoogle">Made by Google YouTube channel</a> (or right here!) to catch Google&#39;s event, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon and also include other celebrities like Stephen Curry, Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers. The event kicks off at 1PM ET on August 20 â€” get ready for some awkward celebrity cameos!</p>

<p>What&#39;s on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-rolls-out-its-most-powerful-gemini-model-yet-151205875.html">Gemini AI features</a>, too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too.</p>
