Amazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.

AWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its third-quarter earnings release on Thursday.

In July, AWS partnered with Perplexity to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.

The intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.

These huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for t
