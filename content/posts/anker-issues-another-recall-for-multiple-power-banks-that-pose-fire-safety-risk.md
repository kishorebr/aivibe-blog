<p>Anker has issued its second recall this month for several power bank models sold around the world, as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/anker-power-bank-recall/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> has reported. If you'll recall, its previous recall that launched earlier this month <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Anker;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=aac3354f-048f-410b-ae8a-eb1da43ee6cf&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=68a485c2-50b3-4524-ade0-c27ba90e6288&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anker&amp;linkText=focused&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmtlci5jb20vYTEyNjMtcmVjYWxsIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2OGE0ODVjMi01MGIzLTQ1MjQtYWRlMC1jMjdiYTkwZTYyODgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFua2VyLmNvbS9hMTI2My1yZWNhbGwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATsjCx31HjbSYbfyUMo5T6BRvRQDZkkJ2OCpMEMM52q-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fa1263-recall" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.anker.com/a1263-recall">focused</a> on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/anker-recalls-over-a-million-power-banks-due-to-fire-and-burn-hazards-110017437.html">Anker PowerCore 10000</a> power bank model A1263, which were sold between June 1, 2016 and December 31st, 2022 in the United States. The company found that the lithium-ion battery it used for the model has a risk of overheating that could then lead to the power bank melting, producing smoke and, ultimately, catching fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Anker has issued a global recall for multiple products sold in several markets around the world. Those products are the Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) Model A1257, Anker Power Bank (20,000mAh, 22.5W, Built-In USB-C Cable) Model A1647, Anker MagGo Power Bank (10,000mAh, 7.5W) Model A1652, Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C and Lightning Cable)  Model A1681 and Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C Cable) Model A1689.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company said that it implemented a series of enhanced quality assurance protocols earlier this year, all of which were designed to detect manufacturing issues. It found that those particular models use   lithium-ion battery cells from a single vendor, which are at risk of overheating and causing fire. The company said that the chances of malfunction are minimal, but it launched the recall out of an abundance of caution anyway and is advising customers to stop using affected models.&nbsp;</p>
