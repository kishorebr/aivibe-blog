<p>Microsoft is creating a new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/#:~:text=Advanced%20shader%20delivery">&quot;advanced shader delivery&quot;</a> feature for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handhelds that might make loading games faster and more stutter-free. The company teased the upcoming feature alongside the announcement of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-handhelds-will-be-available-october-16-but-we-still-dont-know-the-price-134015698.html">the launch date</a> for the first Xbox-branded handhelds and the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-unveils-its-handheld-compatibility-program-162635781.html">new compatibility system</a> for figuring out if games will run well on handhelds.</p>
<p>Shader stutter is a widespread issue in PC gaming that doesn&#39;t occur on consoles because of their uniform hardware. You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they&#39;re first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft&#39;s system &quot;preloads game shaders during download&quot; which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, &quot;run smoother, and use less battery on first play.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won&#39;t impact every game at launch. It&#39;s just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-windows-10-xbox-game-bar.html">Game Bar</a> and ASUS&#39; Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will &quot;minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks&quot; to devote more resources to playing games.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-working-on-a-fix-for-pc-shader-stutter-193616440.html?src=rss
