<p>Coming off its smash indie hit <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spiritfarer-mobile-game-netflix-174704824.html"><em>Spiritfarer</em></a>, Thunder Lotus Games is taking a more action-heavy approach with its next title. The developer debuted <em>At Fate's End</em> with an announcement trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-new-at-summer-game-fest-2025-marvel-tokon-resident-evil-requiem-and-more-185425995.html">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, giving us a taste of its captivating visuals and unique combat system.</p>

<p>While <em>Spiritfarer</em> offered a more slow-paced experience filled with charming characters looking for a final peace, <em>At Fate's End</em> has a contrasting action-packed style where you follow the story of Shan, a heiress to a clan that's looking to resolve familial disputes by either fighting or talking it out. The gameplay looks equal parts narrative fantasy and intriguing combat style, since you can use tactical dialogue mid-fight or psychological insight about your family to turn the tide of battle. As you progress through the story, you'll face more of your estranged family members, and you advance your skill tree in different ways depending on whether you defeat or reconcile with them.</p>
