<p>OpenAI plans to open the floodgates to more adult uses of ChatGPT starting in December, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128">a new post from CEO Sam Altman</a>. The company announced that it would add <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/following-teen-suicide-openai-explores-automatic-underage-user-restrictions-151948711.html">parental controls and automatic age detection features</a> in September, and it seems like a benefit of sorting out children from adults is an ability to offer more freedom in what ChatGPT can show users.</p>
<p>&quot;In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our &#39;treat adult users like adults&#39; principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,&quot; Altman says. Some avid ChatGPT users already regularly manipulate the chatbot to engage in NSFW conversations, but Altman&#39;s announcement sounds more like tacit approval from OpenAI that those use-cases are okay.</p>

<p>The company signaled something similar during its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canva-and-other-apps-can-now-connect-to-chatgpt-194830116.html">DevDay 2025 announcements</a>, when its new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines#:~:text=Support%20for%20mature%20(18%2B)%20experiences%20will%20arrive%20once%20appropriate%20age%20verification%20and%20controls%20are%20in%20place.">guidelines</a> for developers creating apps for ChatGPT shared that &quot;support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place.&quot; After December, it sounds like adult interactions with ChatGPT or apps the chatbot can access are fair game.</p>
<p>All of these changes are being made in the shadow of disturbing stories of the seemingly negative influence ChatGPT can have on users, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">the death of 16-year old Adam Raine</a>, who allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his own suicide.</p>
<p>Reducing the chatbot&#39;s sycophantic qualities with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html">release of GPT-5</a> was one of the ways OpenAI tried to address the mental health impacts of ChatGPT, along with built-in notifications to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-will-now-remind-you-to-take-breaks-following-mental-health-concerns-180221008.html">remind users to take breaks</a>. It&#39;s hard to definitively say whether these tweaks have made a difference, but combined with age-gating, it&#39;s clear OpenAI feels comfortable giving its chatbot a longer leash.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html?src=rss
