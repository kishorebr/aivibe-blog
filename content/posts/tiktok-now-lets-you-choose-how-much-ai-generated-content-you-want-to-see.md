TikTok, an app that was once just a place for user-generated content, is launching a new setting that lets users choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their “For You” feed. The company is also introducing more advanced labeling technologies for AI-generated content.

The new AI-generated content (AIGC) control is rolling out within the app’s “Manage Topics” tool, which lets users choose what they see on TikTok. 


	
	




	
	



“Manage Topics already enables people to adjust how often they see content related to over 10 categories like Dance, Sports, and Food & Drinks,” TikTok explained in a blog post. “Like those controls, the AIGC setting is intended to help people tailor the diverse range of content in their feed, rather than removing or replacing content in feeds entirely.” 

The move comes as companies like OpenAI and Meta are embracing AI-only feeds. In September, Meta released Vibes, a new feed for sharing and creating short AI-generated videos. A few days after Meta’s launch, OpenAI released Sora, a social media platform for creating and sharing AI-generated videos. 

Since Sora’s launch, realistic AI-generated videos have been posted to TikTok. Additionally, many TikTok users are leveraging AI to create visuals for posts about other topics, like history or celebrities.

TikTok says that with the new AI-generated content control, users who want to see less of this sort of content can now dial things down, while those who enjoy it can choose to see more of it.

The change is rolling out in the coming weeks, TikTok says.
