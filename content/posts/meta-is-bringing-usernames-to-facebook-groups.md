<p>Meta has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-update-group-admins-flexibility-protecting-member-privacy/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">long required</a> Facebook users to post under their real names (with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-facebook-changes-real-name-policy-rules-after-public-outcry.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">some exceptions</a>), but at least for Facebook Groups, the company is now offering new options. Members of Facebook Groups will now be able to participate under a custom nickname and avatar, rather than being forced to use their real name or post anonymously.</p><p>You can set a custom nickname via the same toggle that lets you create an anonymous post, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1997112804420300?helpref=faq_content" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Meta says</a>. Nicknames have to be enabled by a group&#39;s administrators, and in some cases individually approved, but once they are, you can switch between posting under your real name or a nickname freely. The only other limitation is that the nickname needs to comply with Meta&#39;s existing Community Standards and Terms of Service. While you set your new nickname, you can also pick from a selection of custom avatars, which seem to mostly be pictures of cute animals wearing sunglasses.</p><p>Groups are one of several areas of Facebook that Meta has continually tried to tweak in the last few years to bring back users. In 2024, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-is-pushing-local-content-and-events-to-try-to-win-back-young-adults-161742961.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">introduced a tab</a> that highlighted local events shared in Facebook groups. More recently, it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-update-group-admins-flexibility-protecting-member-privacy/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">added tools</a> for admins to convert private groups into public ones to try and draw in new members. No single change can make Facebook the center of young people&#39;s lives in the way it was in the early 2000s, but letting people use what amounts to a username might encourage Facebook users to explore new groups and post more freely.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-usernames-to-facebook-groups-231405698.html?src=rss
