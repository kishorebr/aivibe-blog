According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3"><em>Financial Times</em></a> report, the partnership is still struggling with some &quot;technical issues&quot; that could ultimately end up pushing back the device&#39;s release date, which is expected to be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/openai-to-buy-apple-veteran-jony-ive-s-ai-device-startup-in-6-5-billion-deal?srnd=undefined">sometime in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>One of those lingering dilemmas involves figuring out the AI assistant&#39;s voice and mannerisms, according to <em>FT</em>&#39;s sources.
