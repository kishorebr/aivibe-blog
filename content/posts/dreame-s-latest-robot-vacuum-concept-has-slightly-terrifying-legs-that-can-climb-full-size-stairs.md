<p>Robot vacuum companies are once again out in full force at CES 2026, giving their devices a new set of intriguing — and sometimes unsettling — capabilities. This year, Chinese appliance maker Dreame is showing off a vacuum prototype with giant legs that can climb up and down an entire flight of stairs.</p><p>The concept, called the Cyber X, was previewed last year at IFA in Berlin. The vacuum sports a somewhat terrifying set of legs with rubber treads that allow it to autonomously navigate multi-story environments. While Dreame has previously shown off vacuums that can move up <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">smaller steps</a>, it says the Cyber X can climb stairs up to 25cm (9.8 inches) high and slopes up to 42 degrees. It can manage both straight and curved staircases, and can climb a flight of steps in 27 seconds, according to the company.</p><p>We got a chance to see the Cyber X and its stair-climbing abilities at Dreame’s CES booth, and the device was able to deftly crawl up and down a flight of stairs. The Cyber X didn’t use its “legs” to walk up the steps, though. Instead, it used the treads horizontally, moving a bit like a miniature, cleaning tank.</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/CrFGiQsa" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Interestingly, the actual vacuum is separate from the climbing apparatus. As you can see in the image below, the larger device with legs has an opening where the actual robot vacuum can dock inside and sit while the Cyber X climbs stairs. </p><p>That likely means the Cyber X isn’t able to clean the stairs themselves, though it does cleverly solve the problem of transporting the vacuum throughout multi-story environments. </p><p>In addition to its legs, the Cyber X’s vacuum also has a built-in water tank to support mopping abilities, and a laser-powered navigation system to help it maneuver up stairs and around other obstacles. It also has a braking system that allows it to stay stable on floors and stairs, even if the battery dies. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Dreame&#39;s Cyber X." data-uuid="8a324934-df10-4c2c-b2ab-0b05c9d1562d"><figcaption>Dreame&#39;s Cyber X.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>For now, Dreame says Cyber X is just a research prototype and hasn&#39;t indicated if it plans to make it, or a robo vac like it, more widely available at some point in the future. But Dreame has a history of showing off innovative features at CES ahead of an actual release. Last year, the company had a prototype vacuum with a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">mechanical arm</a> at its CES booth. This year, it announced a new vacuum with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-robot-vacuum-with-an-arm-is-back-at-ces-2026-and-it-can-do-more-than-pick-up-shoes-210000020.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">very similar abilities</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also announced the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8faa8686-f479-477d-a031-581dc7394a8b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=efe72a0d-8e7e-44a0-8cf7-e8910908c28b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=dreame&amp;linkText=Dreame+X60+Max+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kcmVhbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy94NjAtbWF4LXVsdHJhLWNvbXBsZXRlLXJvYm90LXZhY3V1bSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWZlNzJhMGQtOGU3ZS00NGEwLThjZjctZTg5MTA5MDhjMjhiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kcmVhbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy94NjAtbWF4LXVsdHJhLWNvbXBsZXRlLXJvYm90LXZhY3V1bSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQY0e6rSH_jKKSZBXGwHTdCAMQsJS43XZ65IQpg5nKQU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dreametech.com%2Fproducts%2Fx60-max-ultra-complete-robot-vacuum" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:dreame;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.dreametech.com/products/x60-max-ultra-complete-robot-vacuum">Dreame X60 Max Ultra</a>, its latest flagship robot vacuum that can roll up smaller steps. The X60 Max Ultra, which costs $1,699, can move over stairs up to 8.8cm (about 3.4 inches), a small improvement over last year&#39;s X50, which could clear heights of 6cm (about 2.4 inches). That&#39;s not enough to manage a full-size stair, which is typically around 7 inches, but it should make the X60 flexible enough to navigate threshold steps and other small obstacles.</p><p><strong>Update, January 6, 2026, 5:07PM PT:</strong> This post was updated with new photos and video and to add additional information about the Cyber X after seeing a live demonstration at Dreame’s CES booth. <br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dreames-latest-robot-vacuum-concept-has-slightly-terrifying-legs-that-can-climb-full-size-stairs-210000399.html?src=rss
