<p>It&#39;s September, and that usually means it&#39;s iPhone season. Like clockwork, Apple once again appears set to show off new smartphones with its latest showcase next week. The upcoming event has been dubbed &quot;Awe dropping,&quot; so we&#39;re hoping for a few announcements that&#39;ll warrant the tagline. The showcase begins on September 9 at 1PM ET/10AM PT.</p>
<p>If you want to tune in to hear what Tim Cook and crew have to say about the presumed iPhone 17, you can stream the show on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple&#39;s website</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU">YouTube channel</a>.

<p>With just a few days to go until the &quot;Awe dropping&quot; event, it seems like we&#39;ve already gotten a lot of advanced insights about what the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-lineup-rumors-prices-new-features-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-153024440.html">iPhone 17 lineup</a> has in store. Apple introduced the software side of the equation with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-features-in-the-upcoming-iphone-update-135749557.html">iOS 26</a> unveil at WWDC this summer, and since then we&#39;ve gotten some pretty reliable insights on the hardware.</p>
<p>The big reveal is expected to be an ultralight smartphone, likely called the iPhone 17 Air. This would be Apple&#39;s first application of its Air nomenclature for mobile, and when we had <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/engadget-podcast-iphone-17-event-preview-with-bloombergs-mark-gurman-113000693.html"><em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman on the Engadget Podcast</a> at the end of August, he suggested that the first iteration of the smartphone might come with some growing pains. We also anticipate seeing a base iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Beyond the smartphones, the &quot;Awe dropping&quot; event could also include three new Apple Watches and updated AirPods Pro earbuds. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-05/what-apple-is-planning-to-introduce-at-sept-9-awe-dropping-iphone-17-event"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that Apple has several other devices in the works as well, including a new AirTag, Apple TV and iPad Pro, but it&#39;s not as certain if those will pop up at this specific event. Either way, you can tune in on September 9 to hear about all the new product launches.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-watch-apple-debut-the-iphone-17-lineup-at-its-awe-dropping-event-on-september-9-130040222.html?src=rss
