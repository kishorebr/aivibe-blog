<p>Xbox's <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-previews-cloud-streaming-of-games-you-own-on-consoles-211008822.html">"Stream your own game" feature</a> continues to expand. You can now use your PC to play supported games you own on Xbox. (The games stream from the cloud, not your console.) You'll need to be an Xbox Insider and Game Pass Ultimate subscriber to use it.</p>
<p>The PC launch follows <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-users-can-now-stream-games-they-own-on-their-consoles-173739687.html">the feature's arrival earlier this year</a> on other devices. Already supported were Xbox consoles, TVs, browser-based devices (including mobile) and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html">Meta Quest headsets</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea is the latest chapter in Microsoft's mission to make Xbox software more device-agnostic. Hop on whatever device is available, and start playing without waiting for installations. That makes sense from a business perspective, given Sony's commanding <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/463760/ps5-vs-xbox-series-xs-sales-comparison-in-the-us-december-2024/">lead</a> in their two-way console race. It's increasingly more about selling Game Pass subscriptions than <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-should-exit-the-console-business-160023834.html">fighting a losing hardware battle</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft lists over 250 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">supported games</a>.

Microsoft says it will add more over time.</p>
<p>The company says the collection includes some console-only titles. But you'll be hard-pressed to find many that aren't already available (natively) on PC. On the other hand, this method could free up storage and save you the hassle of downloading them.</p>
<p>There are some caveats. You'll need to own digital copies of those you want to stream to your PC. (Physical copies won't cut it.) The feature is only available in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions">28 countries</a> where Xbox Cloud Gaming is supported. You'll also need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which costs $20 per month.
