<p>The Sundance documentary <em>Ghost in the Machine</em> boldly declares that the pursuit of artificial intelligence, and Silicon Valley itself, is rooted in eugenics.&nbsp;</p><p>Director Valerie Veatch makes the case that the rise of techno-fascism from the likes of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel is a feature, not a bug. That may sound hyperbolic, but <em>Ghost in the Machine</em>, which is built around interviews with philosophers, AI researchers, historians and computer scientists, leaves little room for doubt.</p><p>If you've been following the meteoric rise of AI, or Silicon Valley in general, Veatch's methodical deconstruction of the technology doesn't really unearth anything new.

Given how much our lives are already dominated by gadgets and social networks from companies that have pioneered addictive engagement over user safety, it's easy to imagine history repeating itself with AI.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Ghost in the Machine</em> doesn't leave any room for considering potential benefits around AI, which could lead proponents of the technology to dismiss it as a hit-job. But we're currently at the apex of the AI hype cycle, after Big Tech has invested hundreds of billions of dollars on this technology, and after it has spent years shoving it down our throats without proving why it’s actually useful to many people. AI should be able to withstand a bit of criticism.</p><p><em>Ghost in the Machine is available to view at the </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://festival.sundance.org/tickets/online" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>Sundance Film Festival’s website and streaming apps</em></a><em> from today through the end of Sunday, February 1st.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p><br><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sundance-doc-ghost-in-the-machine-draws-a-damning-line-between-ai-and-eugenics-180613367.html?src=rss
