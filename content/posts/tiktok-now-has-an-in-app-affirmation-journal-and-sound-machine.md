<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktoks-new-bulletin-board-feature-lets-creators-send-updates-to-their-fans-inboxes-181000448.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">TikTok</a> is replacing its screen time management page with a Time and Well-being space, which also comes with new wellness features. You can now find an affirmation journal, where you can set your intentions for the day using the 120-plus cards the app provides. You can, say, choose the “grace” card that reminds you to be free of the expectation of others. The card is downloadable on your device, and you can share it with others. </p><p>You’ll also find an in-app soothing sound generator that you can use to listen to relaxing audio, such as those featuring the sound of rain, waves and white noise. The sounds stop after a few minutes when the timer ends, so you can play them to induce sleep when you go to bed. TikTok says its users are 14 percent more likely to listen to music to help them relax or go to sleep than non-users. You’ll also find different types of breathing exercises you can do in the new space. </p><p>In addition, TikTok is rolling out new well-being missions, expanding the original set it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-gamifies-mindfulness-with-well-being-missions-110014036.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched in July</a>. These missions, which are particularly designed for teens, will reward you with badges for completing challenges related to balanced digital habits. The new Sleep Hours Mission will award you with a badge if you stay off TikTok at night, while the daily screen time mission will earn you another if you set a screen time limit and manage to stick to it. There’s also a new weekly screen time mission that will prompt you to check your screen time report every week, as well as a well-being ambassador mission that will earn you badges if you invite others to do the missions. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-now-has-an-in-app-affirmation-journal-and-sound-machine-050100713.html?src=rss
