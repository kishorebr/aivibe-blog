<p>A brand spanking-new FoloToy teddy bear can be yours once again. However, he may now be less knowledgeable about spanking. The infamous &quot;Kumma&quot; children&#39;s AI teddy bear, once <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/sales-of-a-teddy-bear-were-suspended-because-of-its-sexually-explicit-ai-233127354.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">an expert in BDSM and knife-fetching</a>, is back on sale. The company claims the toy now has stronger child safety protections in place.</p><p>The Singapore-based FoloToy suspended sales of Kumma last week after a research group published an eyebrow-raising report. The PIRG Education Fund found that the fuzzy little teddy had a few spicy secrets.</p><p>The review discovered that the AI toy had a thing for blades and kinky bedroom play. The bear had no problem suggesting where to find knives in the home. And it not only replied to sexual prompts but also expanded on them. Researchers say it ran with their explicit cues, escalating them in graphic detail and &quot;introducing new sexual concepts of its own.&quot; It explained sex positions, gave step-by-step instructions for sexual bondage and detailed various role-playing scenarios. Who knew Kumma had it in him?</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/folotoy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/folotoy.jpg" style="height:1502px;width:2670px;" alt="Marketing photo of a child grinning, looking at a teddy bear on a counch." data-uuid="c1189f47-b041-462d-9bd9-5ada5aa68cd3"/><figcaption>Marketing photo of a child grinning, looking at a teddy bear on a counch.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FoloToy</div></figure><p>Although it&#39;s hard not to laugh at the absurdity of it all, this stuff is no joke for parents. With the tech industry <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsungs-2025-bespoke-appliances-are-going-all-in-on-ai-020018377.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">pushing AI everything on us</a> for the last three years, it&#39;s easy for a casual observer to conclude that it&#39;s all very safe, regulated and ready for vulnerable eyes and ears. PIRG did acknowledge that young children were unlikely to have prompted the bear with a term like &quot;kink.&quot; (Older siblings may have been another story.) Still, the group&#39;s tests highlighted a shockingly lax approach to content moderation on a child&#39;s toy.</p><p>In its statement announcing Kumma&#39;s return, FoloToy <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/folotoy/status/1992991601384444107" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">boasted</a> that it was the only company of the three targeted in the review to suspend sales. (Could it be that it’s less about principles and more about it being the only one that got media coverage?) The company described the bear&#39;s short hiatus as &quot;a full week of rigorous review, testing and reinforcement of our safety modules.&quot; Wait, a whole week? <em>Whoa there, partner!!</em></p><p>Before his trip to AI rehab, Kumma was advertised as being powered by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">GPT-4o</a>. Following PIRG&#39;s review, OpenAI told the organization that it had suspended FoloToy for violating its policies. The bear&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.folotoy.com/products/folotoy-ai-teddy" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">new listing</a> makes no mention of GPT-4o or any specific AI models.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/folotoys-ai-teddy-bear-is-back-on-sale-following-its-brief-foray-into-bdsm-213138383.html?src=rss
