Even three years after the generative AI boom started, most AI startups are still making money by selling to businesses, not individual consumers.

Although consumers quickly adopted general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, most specialized consumer GenAI applications have yet to resonate.


	
	




	
	



“A lot of early AI applications around video, audio, and photo were super cool,” said Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, onstage at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event in early December. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.”

Chien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.

He argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish.

“I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb.

We could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said.
