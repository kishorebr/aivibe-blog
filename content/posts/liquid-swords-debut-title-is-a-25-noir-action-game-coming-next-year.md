<p>The debut game from Liquid Swords will arrive in early 2026, it was announced at today&#39;s PC Gaming Show. <em>Samson: A Tyndalston Story </em>is billed as &quot;a consequence-heavy noir action game&quot; by its developer, and focuses on the eponymous Samson McCray, a man who&#39;s got himself into serious debt in a city that doesn’t seem particularly forgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debut trailer doesn’t give too much away in terms of story, but I’m getting gritty Max Payne-y vibes. Combat looks crunchy and visceral, and it sounds like Liquid Swords is going for an oppressive atmosphere. &quot;Samson is built on a simple, brutal truth: every day costs you,&quot; writes the studio in a press release. &quot;Debt grows with interest, and time works against you. Each job burns a limited pool of Action Points and every decision shifts how the city treats you—there are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.&quot;</p>

<p>Liquid Swords has been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067?s=20">teasing</a> its first game for a while. The studio has some serious pedigree, being founded in 2020 by Christopher Sundberg, who created the Just Cause franchise when he was at Avalanche Studios. Developers who previously worked on <em>Mad Max</em> and the Battlefield series have also joined Sundberg at Liquid Swords, and the studio says it drew on its collective experience in combat systems, systemic design, animation and action-oriented storytelling to create <em>Samson</em>.</p>
<p>Just Cause was an open-world series, but it sounds like <em>Samson </em>will be a more focused experience, possibly reflected by its $25 price tag. At the beginning of the year, the studio <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges">laid off</a> an undisclosed number of employees, something it said was necessary to ensure its “long-term sustainability” amid challenging industry conditions. <em>Samson: A Tyndalston Story </em>launches in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store. We don&#39;t yet know if it&#39;s coming to console as well.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/liquid-swords-debut-title-is-a-25-noir-action-game-coming-next-year-215544328.html?src=rss
