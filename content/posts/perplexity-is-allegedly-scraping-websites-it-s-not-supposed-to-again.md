<p>Web crawlers deployed by Perplexity to scrape websites are allegedly skirting restrictions, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/">a new report from Cloudflare</a>. Specifically, the report claims that the company&#39;s bots appear to be &quot;stealth crawling&quot; sites by disguising their identity to get around robots.txt files and firewalls.</p>
<p>Robots.txt is a simple file websites host that lets web crawlers know if they can scrape a websites&#39; content or not. Perplexity&#39;s official <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#verified-bots">web crawling bots</a> are &quot;PerplexityBot&quot; and &quot;Perplexity-User.&quot; In Cloudflare&#39;s tests, Perplexity was still able to display the content of a new, unindexed website, even when those specific bots were blocked by robots.txt. The behavior extended to websites with specific Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that restricted web crawlers, as well.</p>

<p>Cloudflare believes that Perplexity is getting around those obstacles by using &quot;a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS&quot; when robots.txt prohibits its normal bots. In Cloudlfare&#39;s tests, the company&#39;s undeclared crawler could also rotate through IP addresses not listed in Perplexity&#39;s official IP range to get through firewalls. Cloudflare says that Perplexity appears to be doing the same thing with autonomous system numbers (ASNs) — an identifier for IP addresses operated by the same business — writing that it spotted the crawler switching ASNs &quot;across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Perplexity for comment on Cloudflare&#39;s report. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>Up-to-date information from websites is vital to companies training AI models, especially as service&#39;s like Perplexity are used as replacements for search engines. Perplexity has also been caught in the past circumventing the rules to stay up-to-date.  <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-companies-are-reportedly-still-scraping-websites-despite-protocols-meant-to-block-them-132308524.html">Multiple websites reported in 2024</a> that Perplexity was still accessing their content despite them forbidding it in robots.txt — something the company blamed on the third-party web crawlers it was using at the time. Perplexity later <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/perplexity-will-put-ads-in-its-ai-search-engine-and-share-revenue-with-publishers-130052289.html">partnered with multiple publishers</a> to share revenue earned from ads displayed alongside their content, seemingly as a make-good for its past behavior.</p>
<p>Stopping companies from scraping content from the web will likely remain a game of whack-a-mole. In the meantime, Cloudflare has removed Perplexity&#39;s bots from its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#verified-bots">list of verified bots</a> and implemented a way to identify and block Perplexity&#39;s stealth crawler from accessing its customers&#39; content.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-allegedly-scraping-websites-its-not-supposed-to-again-211110756.html?src=rss
