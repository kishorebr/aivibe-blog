<p>Donald Trump is launching a cellular brand called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://trumpmobile.com/">Trump Mobile</a>. The newly formed company, which was <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aax7DFNSNUE">announced today</a> by Donald Trump Jr., will sell a single wireless plan called “The 47 Plan,” which offers unlimited talk and texting, as well as unlimited data that throttles speeds after the first 20GB each month. The Trump Mobile service is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://trumpmobile.com/term-of-use">a white-label plan</a> built on an existing mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) called <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.libertymobileinc.com/">Liberty Mobile</a>. The company also plans to sell “The T1 Phone,” a gold-accented smartphone that it says will be manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>During the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aax7DFNSNUE">announcement event</a> for Trump Mobile held at Trump Tower in New York City, Donald Trump Jr. said they were building something for “people who have been underserved,” and to “make sure that real Americans could get true value from their mobile carriers.” Trump Mobile’s only plan will cost $47.45 per month, which is roughly double that of equivalent offerings at other low-cost carriers like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Mint Mobile;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4bf83d60-b3b9-4075-9fee-2b7ec2899887&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ff45b7b6-df0d-49e9-8c0c-7720c6f802d7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Mint+Mobile&amp;linkText=Mint+Mobile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taW50bW9iaWxlLmNvbS9wbGFucy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmNDViN2I2LWRmMGQtNDllOS04YzBjLTc3MjBjNmY4MDJkNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWludG1vYmlsZS5jb20vcGxhbnMvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfA-0zimvPDBHGxlIw06Lh-fs-ZLpbSCnQyaOVOXpQdM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fplans%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.mintmobile.com/plans/">Mint Mobile</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Boost Mobile;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1ae5a702-13e8-4d66-b824-b92c8d2c4cd6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ff45b7b6-df0d-49e9-8c0c-7720c6f802d7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Boost+Mobile&amp;linkText=Boost+Mobile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib29zdG1vYmlsZS5jb20vcGxhbnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmNDViN2I2LWRmMGQtNDllOS04YzBjLTc3MjBjNmY4MDJkNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9vc3Rtb2JpbGUuY29tL3BsYW5zIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASmMm_vvD6Ba1BeyfWFeinyz_7IakmAal-IJAUzf7zxj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fplans" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans">Boost Mobile</a>. Liberty Mobile, the MVNO behind Trump Mobile, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.libertymobileinc.com/Plan">offers plans</a> starting at $20 per month. Customers will be able to use their own devices with a Trump Mobile SIM card.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The plan will supposedly include a telemedicine service <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://trumpmobile.com/telehealth">powered by Doctegrity</a>, which will allow subscribers to access medical and behavioral health services through the third-party provider. The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://trumpmobile.com/service-agreement-and-roadside-assistance">plan is also said to include</a> roadside assistance provided by Drive America and mobile device protection by Omega Mobile Care.</p>
<p>Details on The T1 Phone are sparse, though some specs are listed on the website. The phone is said to sport a 6.8” AMOLED screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a rear three-camera setup with a 50MP main camera, and 2MP “depth sensor” and macro cameras, a fingerprint sensor and “AI Face Unlock,” and a “5000mAh long life camera,” which we presume was intended to describe the battery. The phone is said to run on Android 15. Oh, and it costs $499, which is both more than what it's likely worth, and casts doubt on its manufacturing claims. Recall that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ff45b7b6-df0d-49e9-8c0c-7720c6f802d7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=estimates&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA0LzExL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWEtbWFkZS1pbi10aGUtdXNhLWlwaG9uZS13b3VsZC1jb3N0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmNDViN2I2LWRmMGQtNDllOS04YzBjLTc3MjBjNmY4MDJkNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyNS8wNC8xMS9oZXJlcy1ob3ctbXVjaC1hLW1hZGUtaW4tdGhlLXVzYS1pcGhvbmUtd291bGQtY29zdC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQNvz7nMdA5NjdIybHYeYfdSbUCfwkWE7WQYZejwrjSc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F04%2F11%2Fheres-how-much-a-made-in-the-usa-iphone-would-cost.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/heres-how-much-a-made-in-the-usa-iphone-would-cost.html">estimates</a> for American-made iPhone were in the ballpark of $1,500.
