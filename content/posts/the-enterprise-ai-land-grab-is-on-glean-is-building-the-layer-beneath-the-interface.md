The battle for enterprise AI is heating up. Microsoft is bundling Copilot into Office. Google is pushing Gemini into Workspace. OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant. 


In the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it. 

Seven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.


	
	




	
	



“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”

He says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic. 

“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”

Glean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data. 





The Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.
