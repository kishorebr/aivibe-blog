<p>PlayStation had <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1998407291754729536"><ins>said</ins></a> on X that it would have news about Saros at The Game Awards, and unfortunately, fans excited for the new Housemarque project will need to wait a little longer to get their hands on it. The game has been delayed from its planned March release. But there&#39;s only a short time until the new date of April 30, and pre-orders are open now. Star Rahul Kohli appeared at The Game Awards to introduce the newest trailer for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad we won&#39;t be waiting too much longer, because <em>Saros</em> looks very cool. Housemarque made its name on titles like <em>Resogun</em> and <em>Returnal</em>, and <em>Saros</em> seems like a great addition to their library. The latest trailer shows off all the golden and solar vibes in Carcosa. It also has more glimpses of the characters and story as well as the dangerous and deadly beings that will be trying very hard to kill you.</p>
