<p>As if we needed more ways to grow our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-adds-more-accessibility-features-181606704.html">Steam</a> libraries with games we&#39;ll never finish or even play. Now, Steam is experimenting with a redesigned storefront menu as part of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/steam/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=500579345320904590">latest beta update</a> to help sell more games. Instead of being overwhelmed with text links and cluttered menu buttons in the current version, Steam&#39;s store page remodel combines everything into a more polished and organized menu at the top.</p>
<p>In its blog post, Steam said that the redesign is supposed to &quot;provide easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit.&quot; At the top, the new browse feature lets you get right into digging through games, based on options like top sellers, new releases or discounts. Next to browse, the recommendations button lets you explore what Steam thinks you&#39;ll like, based on other games in your library, your games&#39; playtimes or even community recommendations. To get a more tailored feel, the categories menu button will give you a look at your top genres and offer some suggested tags to find similar games.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Steam also revamped the store&#39;s search function to show the most popular searches, your recently viewed games, and top genres. There&#39;s even a button for advanced search for users who want to sort through games with specific filters and tags. None of these features are new, but Steam&#39;s new look makes it easier to get to the most useful parts of the store page.</p>

<p>&quot;With these changes, weâ€™re aiming to make your experience smoother and more tailored to your needs,&quot; Steam wrote in its blog post. &quot;We&#39;ve been hearing from players, and experiencing ourselves, that some of the most commonly visited areas of Steam were hard to get to.&quot;</p>
<p>We may be getting improved search functionality with Steam&#39;s storefront, but it comes amid frustrations over Steam&#39;s recent policy change. Earlier this month, Steam <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html">delisted tons of titles</a> with adult or NSFW content to appease its popular payment processors, like Visa and Mastercard, leading to criticism of setting a worrying precedent of censorship. For now, the store page redesign is still part of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">Steam Client Beta</a>, where you can submit feedback to help shape the final look.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-is-testing-out-a-redesigned-storefront-that-makes-it-easier-to-find-games-youll-like-165216486.html?src=rss
