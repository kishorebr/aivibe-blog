<p>Roland just unveiled the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.roland.com/RolandComSite/media/global/release/pdf/2026/20260120_1_GOMIXER_STUDIO.pdf"><ins>Go:Mixer Studio</ins></a>, a powerful entry in the company&#39;s line of audio interfaces. This one promises to be a portable and affordable way to create high-quality recordings with a smartphone or PC.</p>
<p>The biggest news here are the 12 input channels and six output channels. This means that users can record multiple instruments at once and even run the signal through outboard gear if so desired. There are two XLR inputs on the back with phantom power, an instrument jack, stereo ¼-inch line-in jacks, an aux input, TRS MIDI ins and outs, two headphones jacks and stereo line outs for connecting monitor speakers.</p>

<p>It records up to 24-bit/192kHz audio, which will certainly get the job done. The device comes with built-in effects for mangling audio on the fly. Each audio input also has a dedicated EQ and compressor directly on the channel.</p>
<p>It connects via an app that&#39;s available for iOS, Windows and MacOS. The iOS app actually lets users capture both video and multitrack audio at the same time, which should be a boon for streamers and content creators of all stripes. The Windows and MacOS apps allow for complete control of the mixer remotely.</p>
<p>As for the unit itself, there are several big knobs to adjust parameters and a color display. It&#39;s also really small and light, making it easy to pack away in case of an unexpected recording session. The device can even be mounted on a mic stand.</p>
<p>The Roland Go: Mixer Studio is available right now and costs $300.
