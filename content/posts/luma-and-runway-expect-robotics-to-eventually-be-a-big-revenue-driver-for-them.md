			Luma and Runway expect robotics to eventually be a big revenue driver for them

			
AI video-generating startups Luma and Runway are looking beyond movie studios.

These video-generating AI companies have their sights set on other markets for future revenue streams and have been in talks with both robotics and self-driving car companies, according to reporting from The Information. The report didn’t identify which companies Luma and Runway are in talks with.


	
	




	
	



This potential revenue stream makes sense for Luma in particular. The company announced it was looking to build 3D AI world models in early 2024 with the goal of having these models understand how to see and interact with the world around them, TechCrunch reported at the time.

Runway is also targeting video games as a potential future revenue stream, too, according to The Information.

TechCrunch reached out to Luma and Runway for more information.
