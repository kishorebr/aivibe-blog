In the coming days, they’ll be able to activate a setting called Comic Bitmoji. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-comic-bitmoji" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Snap said</a> this will revive “the charm of classic avatars, while keeping all the benefits of today’s 3D infrastructure.” If you turn on Comic Bitmoji, all Bitmoji avatars that you see in Snapchat will be rendered in 2D. You’ll also be able to send stickers to your friends in that style.</p><p>Snap switched from 2D to 3D avatars back in 2023. The company said the move allowed it to offer a larger array of customizations, including more body types, hairstyles and makeup looks. </p><p>However, many users yearned for a return to a 2D look. Nearly 100,000 of them signed a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.change.org/p/bring-old-snapchat-bitmoji-s-back" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Change.org petition</a> demanding the return of 2D Bitmoji, and Snap said it listened. CEO Evan Spiegel signed the petition too.</p><p>Snap says Comic Bitmoji effectively applies a filter to the 3D avatars. To make the animations and expressions work properly in the 2D format, the team had to make adjustments to proportions, shading and outlines, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91438419/snapchat-is-bringing-back-classic-2d-bitmoji" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Fast Company</em></a>. Snap said that more than 320 million people use Bitmoji every day, so getting the 2D renders right was important. </p><p>It’s a little disappointing that Snap is locking the the Comic Bitmoji setting behind a paywall. However, it seems like just the kind of feature that might prompt more users to sign up for a Snapchat+ subscription.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/snap-is-bringing-back-2d-bitmoji-for-snapchat-subscribers-202257144.html?src=rss
