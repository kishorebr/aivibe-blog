<p>Google is officially <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/gmail-security-protections/">debunking</a> a series of reports that claimed Gmail has been hit with a &quot;major&quot; security issue in recent days. &quot;We want to reassure our users that Gmail’s protections are strong and effective,&quot; the company said in a somewhat unusual statement. &quot;Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false.&quot;</p>
<p>Google doesn&#39;t detail the erroneous claims in its post. But, as <em>Forbes</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/08/31/entirely-false-google-says-theres-no-warning-for-gmail-users/"><ins>points out</ins></a>, it seems to be referring to several recent reports that stated the company issued an &quot;emergency warning&quot; to all of its 2.5 billion users in response to a phishing attack that targeted a Salesforce instance used by the company. That incident, however, was first reported by Google in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion"><ins>early June</ins></a><ins>,</ins> and the company said in an August 8 update that it had finished notifying everyone affected.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear why that report resurfaced now or how it was misconstrued into a supposed warning impacting all Gmail users, but Google is now trying to set the record straight. &quot;While it’s always the case that phishers are looking for ways to infiltrate inboxes, our protections continue to block more than 99.9% of phishing and malware attempts from reaching users,&quot; the company said. &quot;It’s crucial that conversation in this space is accurate and factual.&quot;</p>
<p>Google also notes that it encourages all users to set up &quot;a secure password alternative,&quot; such as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-says-its-secure-entry-passkeys-have-been-used-a-billion-times-120001230.html"><ins>a passkey</ins></a> for maximum protection.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-says-reports-of-a-major-gmail-security-issue-are-entirely-false-224812292.html?src=rss
