<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft is making advances with a new way to cool microchips that it says could lead to more energy-efficient data centers in the future. It's a method called microfluidics that involves liquid coolant flowing directly into the silicon. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After lab tests, Microsoft found that this strategy can remove heat up to three times better than cold plates currently used in data centers today. The company announced this week that it was able to develop a microfluidic cooling system for a server running core services for a simulated Microsoft Teams meeting. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If they can find the same success outside of a lab, microfluidics could cut down the amount  â€¦</p>
