You can tune in right here once the livestream kicks off to see that and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-wwdc-2025-a-new-look-apple-intelligence-and-more-210051144.html">lots of announcements</a> tied to macOS, iOS, iPadOS and all the company&#39;s other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way Apple could reportedly smooth over any ill feelings about AI is by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-reportedly-planning-a-major-redesign-for-ios-19-and-macos-16-202804091.html">completely redesigning its operating systems</a> to make them more cohesive, easier to use and reminiscent of visionOS. The company is said to be planning the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-reportedly-demo-its-liquid-glass-interface-redesign-with-see-through-visuals-at-wwdc-165823089.html">debut of its &quot;Liquid Glass&quot; interface</a> redesign, which will come with &quot;see-through visuals,&quot; for WWDC. The iPad could also receive some attention, with reports suggesting Apple will introduce yet another approach to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-software-will-reportedly-get-more-mac-like-with-the-ipados-19-redesign-200759136.html">multitasking and window management</a> in an effort to make the tablet Mac-like. Add in new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ios-19-will-reportedly-have-ai-powered-battery-management-200127723.html">battery management feature</a> and a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-said-to-be-developing-a-revamped-health-app-with-a-built-in-ai-doctor-170020277.html">&quot;virtual health coach,&quot;</a> and the company may have a raft of updates not immediately Apple Intelligence-related to get excited about.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=575b9193-5802-4f8a-a216-d7322a2e869b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=recently+released+poster+for+WWDC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RldmVsb3Blci5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3cy8_aWQ9Y2N1eGZ6cWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3NWI5MTkzLTU4MDItNGY4YS1hMjE2LWQ3MzIyYTJlODY5YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3MvP2lkPWNjdXhmenFjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYodcl_2I74sPvf4QoBq1v0GEO_1DNQwXKAXLpQLRc-l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fnews%2F%3Fid%3Dccuxfzqc" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ccuxfzqc">recently released poster for WWDC</a>, Apple included a tagline with the two words &quot;Sleek peek.&quot; While previous versions of these have been endlessly speculated over to see if any clues could be found, the ones for the last few years have proven to be vaguely related. The invitation for <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-apple-revealed-at-the-iphone-16-launch-event-apple-watch-series-10-airpods-4-ios-18-and-more-170346723.html">the iPhone event last year </a>said &quot;It&#39;s Glowtime,&quot; which on hindsight could be in reference to the glowing edges of the new Siri interface, but that was first unveiled at WWDC 2024. Ultimately, &quot;It&#39;s Glowtime&quot; had little to do with the iPhone 16 series, which were most notable for their new Camera Control buttons.</p>
<p>In perhaps less significant news, Apple might also be renaming its operating systems, unifying them under a number designating the upcoming year â€” so we could see <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-rumored-to-release-ios-26-not-ios-19-at-wwdc-2025-193424610.html">iOS 26</a>, not iOS 19. It&#39;ll be a nice bit of unity given that we currently have everything from visionOS 2 to iPadOS 18 and everything in between.</p>

<p>To find out what Apple has planned for yourself, you can watch the WWDC 2025 keynote on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">its website</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/apple">its YouTube channel</a> and right here once the livestream is up. Apple will also host developer sessions online for more in-depth, technical overviews of the new software features it announces.</p>
