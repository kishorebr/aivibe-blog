<p>Your iPhone may soon be able to do more than call for emergency help and send messages via satellite, according to the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-09/apple-iphone-satellite-plans-image-texting-third-party-apps-low-cost-macbook-mhrq10p2?srnd=undefined">Power On newsletter</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to expand on satellite features available on iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple introduced the ability to send and receive texts with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-messages-via-satellite-will-work-on-ios-18-and-how-much-it-will-cost-130020976.html">Messages via Satellite</a> feature last year, but is reportedly looking to enhance this with the option to send photos too. Beyond texting, Apple wants to enable 5G NTN support on its iPhones, which allows cell towers to get a coverage boost by tapping into satellites, according to Gurman. For anyone who needs directions in a remote area without a cellular or Wi-Fi connection, Apple reportedly has plans to introduce satellite connectivity to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-reportedly-getting-ready-to-introduce-ads-to-its-maps-app-170654072.html">Apple Maps</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with these upgrades, Gurman reported that Apple is looking into &quot;natural usage&quot; improvements where users won&#39;t have to point their iPhones towards the sky to connect to a satellite network. Instead, an iPhone could stay connected even when there&#39;s no clear view of the sky, like in indoor environments. On the developer side of things, Gurman said that Apple is also working on an API that allows app makers to add satellite connections.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no timeline for when these rumored satellite features will go live, but Apple previously waited a couple of years between introducing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-gives-iphone-14-and-15-owners-an-extra-free-year-of-satellite-connectivity-202434416.html">Emergency SOS via Satellite </a>in 2022 and Messages via Satellite with the release of iOS 18.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-more-satellite-features-for-iphone-172151203.html?src=rss
