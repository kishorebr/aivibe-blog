<p>Lucid EV owners <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/all-lucid-airs-gain-access-23500-tesla-superchargers-2026-lucid">will soon have full access</a> to Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is something that&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-evs-will-be-able-to-access-teslas-superchargers-starting-in-2025-055045292.html">been in the works since 2023</a>. This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company&#39;s vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/lucids-gravity-suv-gets-native-tesla-supercharger-access-on-january-31-140048997.html">Gravity SUV gaining access</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>That leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don&#39;t ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won&#39;t work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it&#39;s also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It&#39;s good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.</p>

<p>The company also recently unveiled the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/22/lucid-launches-2026-air-ev-lineup-more-range-quieter-expensive/">2026 lineup of Air EVs</a>. There&#39;s the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge. Prices start at $114,900, but the seats offer a massage feature.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/lucid-owners-will-get-full-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-on-july-31-184020050.html?src=rss
