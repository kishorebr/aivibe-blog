<p>Instagram&#39;s latest feature should make it easier to resurface videos you&#39;ve viewed. On Friday, Adam Mosseri <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DQMcanmgCvL">revealed</a> a new watch history for Reels. &quot;Hopefully, now you can find that thing that you were trying to find that you couldn&#39;t find before,&quot; the Instagram CEO said.</p>
<p>We could see the feature coming in handy. For example, when you see something interesting but lose it due to an accidental tap or app refresh.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can find it on Instagram under <strong>Settings &gt; Your activity &gt; Watch history</strong>. The feature lets you sort by newest to oldest or vice versa. You can also jump to a specific date or date range, and filter by the account that posted it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-adds-a-watch-history-for-reels-175555668.html?src=rss
