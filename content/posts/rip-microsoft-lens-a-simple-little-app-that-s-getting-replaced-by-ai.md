Sometimes it’s nice to have a simple app that does one thing well without a lot of fuss.

The app’s impending shutdown was first spotted by the site Bleeping Computer, which points out that users are being directed to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which lacks all the functionality found in Lens. While Copilot can handle scanning, it doesn’t support saving those
