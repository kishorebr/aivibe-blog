<p>With <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">streaming service</a> prices constantly on the rise, it can feel like good deals are few and far between. But they do come around every once in a while â€” such is the case with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount Plus;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=855ca62e-ee52-453f-91a1-14fbe4f4bd6a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;linkText=Paramount%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1NWNhNjJlLWVlNTItNDUzZi05MWExLTE0ZmJlNGY0YmQ2YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOKUU1vXUXbEUW7l4rCKNUFLhf9Zv8VyJSYD7ySdLSg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a> right now. You can get half off annual subscriptions through September 18; that brings the Essential (with ads) plan down to $30 for one year instead of $60, and the Premium plan down to $60 for the year instead of $120.</p>

<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">Paramount+</a> from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing. The only real caveat with this deal is that you have to pay for the full year in advance; month-to-month subscriptions will still cost the usual rate.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Paramount+ has some great programming options, particularly if you're a fan of anything involving RuPaul.

The platform offers a solid lineup of sports as well. And if you opt to go for the Premium plan, you'll also be granted access to Showtime titles such as <em>Yellowjackets</em> and the rebooted <em>Dexter: Resurrection</em>.</p>
