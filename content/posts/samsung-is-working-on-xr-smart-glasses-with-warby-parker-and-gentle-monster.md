<p>As part of its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR headset</a> presentation, Samsung also briefly teased another wearable product. It&#39;s working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-xr-opening-new-worlds#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its,play%20into%20daily%20life.">AI-powered smart glasses</a> to go up against Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban models, Samsung&#39;s head of customer experience Jay Kim <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/ITXJquX9FqM?t=6714">announced</a> at the end of the livestream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re also really excited about the AI glasses that we&#39;re currently building together with Google,&quot; Kim said. &quot;We&#39;re working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include &quot;cutting-edge&quot; AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it&#39;s developing &quot;fashion-forward&quot; glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring &quot;style, comfort and practicality&quot; to everyday life via Android&#39;s XR ecosystem. As we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html">saw in May</a> with Google&#39;s prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you&#39;re listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn&#39;t reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta&#39;s lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company&#39;s head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced  its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Ray-Ban Display model</a> that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-is-working-on-xr-smart-glasses-with-warby-parker-and-gentle-monster-042632170.html?src=rss
