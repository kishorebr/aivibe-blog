<p class="has-text-align-none">Applebee’s and IHOP plan to launch an AI-powered “personalization engine” that could help its restaurants provide recommendations and customized deals, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/applebees-and-ihop-plan-to-introduce-ai-in-restaurants-61770ca5?mod=rss_Technology">report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The personalization engine would use a customer’s past purchases — or the orders of customers similar to them — to make recommendations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justin Skelton, the chief information officer at the restaurants’ parent company, Dine Brands, tells the <em>Journal </em>that an AI-powered personalization system would be designed to boost customer loyalty, as well as serve as a way to upsell products. As noted by the <em>Journal</em>, IHOP already has some information about its customers’ ordering habits through its rewards program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of <a href="https://www.today.com/food/trends/chilis-fried-mozzarella-tiktok-rcna184185">chasing viral trends like Chili&#8217;s</a>, other restaurant franchises have hopped on the AI bandwagon as well, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716825/wendys-ai-drive-thru-google-llm">Wendy’s deploying an AI chatbot</a> at its drive-thrus that can take orders and even upsell menu items. McDonald’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-gives-its-restaurants-an-ai-makeover-2134f01e?mod=article_inline">also recently resumed</a> plans to put AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/16/24179679/mcdonalds-ending-ai-chatbot-drive-thru-ordering-test-ibm">at the drive-thru</a> and inside its restaurants, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210506/taco-bell-drive-thru-ai-order-expansion">Taco Bell revealed plans</a> to put “Voice AI” technology at more than 100 of its drive-thrus across the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As noted by the <em>Journal</em>, Dine Brands is considering rolling out AI tools designed for staff members as well. Along with exploring the use of AI-powered cameras to detect when a table needs cleaning, it’s also testing an AI app for managers.</p>
