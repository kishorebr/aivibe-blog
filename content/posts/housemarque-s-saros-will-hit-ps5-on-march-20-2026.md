<p>One thing that Sony confirmed in advance for its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/a-playstation-state-of-play-is-set-for-september-24-143526268.html">September State of Play</a> stream was a first look at gameplay for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-to-ps5-in-2026-232243078.html"><em>Saros</em></a>, the next game from Housemarque (<em>Returnal, Resogun</em>). This is the first completely new project from the developer since it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">joined PlayStation Studios in 2021</a>, and it opened the livestream.</p>
<p>Creative director Gregory Louden took viewers through a peek at the journey of Arjun Devraj (Rahul Kohli), who&#39;s seeking answers on a shape-shifting planet called Carcosa. The combat looks very much in the vein of <em>Returnal</em>, with lots of lasers, projectiles and other nasty stuff to avoid.&nbsp;</p>

He also gets a second chance to survive an encounter as there&#39;s a revival ability he can use after his first death, but you&#39;ll need to unlock the option to do that as it&#39;s part of the permanent progression system. You&#39;ll be able to upgrade your combat suit and other abilities too. Unsurprisingly, it all looks extremely pretty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the first glimpse at gameplay, we got a release date.<em> Saros </em>will hit PS5 on March 20, 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/housemarques-saros-will-hit-ps5-on-march-20-2026-211504381.html?src=rss
