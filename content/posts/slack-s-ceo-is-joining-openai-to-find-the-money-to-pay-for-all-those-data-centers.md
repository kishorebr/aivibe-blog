<p>OpenAI <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-appoints-denise-dresser/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that Denise Dresser, the current CEO of Slack, will be the company&#39;s new Chief Revenue Officer. Dresser will oversee the company&#39;s revenue strategy &quot;across enterprise and customer success,&quot; according to OpenAI&#39;s announcement, and will presumably play a key role in leading the company towards profitability now that it&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-completes-corporate-reorganization-with-support-from-microsoft-133109385.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reorganized as a public benefit corporation</a>.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re on a path to put AI tools into the hands of millions of workers, across every industry,&quot; Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of Products said in the announcement. &quot;Denise has led that kind of shift before, and her experience will help us make AI useful, reliable, and accessible for businesses everywhere.&quot;</p><p>Simo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/leadership-expansion-with-fidji-simo/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">joined OpenAI</a> in May of this year, after serving as CEO of Instacart, and before that, the head of Facebook at Meta. Hiring Simo and Dresser could be a good indication of how OpenAI plans to approach ChatGPT going forward. Which is to say, the company is taking a very Silicon Valley approach to growing its chatbot business and focusing on scale and monetizing as many AI interactions as possible. It&#39;s not a mistake that Simo helped establish Meta&#39;s ads business and OpenAI is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/code-suggests-that-openai-may-be-close-to-introducing-ads-for-chatgpt-172511090.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">reportedly planning</a> to introduce ads into chats with its AI models.</p><p>Even with the possibility of ad revenue, Dresser will still have to overcome what OpenAI continues to spend to offer its various AI products. OpenAI pays for multiple partnerships for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-38-billion-cloud-contract-with-amazon-151821384.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">data center access</a> and has commitments<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/openais-recent-chip-deals-heap-more-pressure-on-tsmc-130000194.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"> to both buy and build server components</a> for those data centers. Add in the cost of just processing a ChatGPT query itself, and growing the company’s revenue seems like a tall order.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/slacks-ceo-is-joining-openai-to-find-the-money-to-pay-for-all-those-data-centers-220411962.html?src=rss
