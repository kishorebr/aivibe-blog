<p>You can grab a number of games from Amazon at no cost if you have a Prime subscription in the days leading up to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-when-we-can-expect-amazons-annual-sales-event-plus-everything-else-you-need-to-know-120028774.html">Prime Day 2025</a>, which takes place from July 8 to July 11. Starting today, June 17 at 12 PM Eastern time, you can get <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-22-dungeon-of-the-endless-is-roguelike-tower-defense-sci-fi-and-fa.html"><em>Dungeon of the Endless</em></a><em> Definitive Edition</em> without paying for it through the Amazon Games App. In the roguelike game, you take on the role of a prison spaceship survivor who has to fight off several floors of creatures after your escape pod crashes into a strange planet. Amazon will also give you free access to <em>TOEM</em>, a photography game by Swedish studio Something We Made, through a GOG code. You&#39;re a photographer in this game who has to solve puzzles using the character&#39;s camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to those two, you can also get <em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft</em> at no cost through GOG. It includes all the original three <em>Tomb Raider Adventures</em> games, all its expansions and secret levels. <em>Saints Row 2</em>, an open world action-adventure game that&#39;s a direct sequel of the first, is free via GOG, as well. In it, you play the same character in the first <em>Saints Row,</em> except you wake up after a coma to find your gang disbanded. You can also claim <em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em> and <em>Star Wars: Rebellion</em> for free via GOG.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Mordheim: City of the Damned</em>, <em>The Abandoned Planet</em>, <em>Station to Station</em> and <em>Death Squared </em>are also all free to claim. <em>Dark Envoy</em> and <em>FATE: Undiscovered Realms</em> will be available on June 19, while <em>Thief: Deadly Shadows</em>, <em>Jupiter Hell </em>and <em>Gallery of Things: Reveries </em>will be available on June 26.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prime Gaming comes bundled with all your other Amazon Prime membership perks. It gives you access to a rotating selection of free games, in-game content, along with a free monthly Twitch subscription. Prime costs $15 a month or $139 a year, but you can get a free 30-day trial when you sign up if you&#39;re unsure about paying for it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amazon-is-giving-away-some-great-games-in-the-lead-up-to-prime-day-050012540.html?src=rss
