<p>Just a day after the xAI team issued a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-team-apologizes-for-the-chatbots-horrific-behavior-and-blames-mechahitler-on-a-bad-update-184520189.html">comprehensive apology</a> and explanation about why its chatbot was spreading <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/grok-sure-seems-antisemitic-after-its-recent-update-000642015.html">antisemitic rhetoric</a>, Tesla updated <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.tesla.com/support/articles/grok">its software</a> for its cars to include the supposedly fixed Grok. According to Tesla, all new vehicles delivered on or after July 12 will have Grok available in-car. There's no additional subscription cost, but Tesla is limiting Grok's availability to models in the US for now.</p>
<p>For older models to run Grok, it requires a Tesla with an AMD processor, the latest software update of 2025.26, and either a stable Wi-Fi connection or Tesla's $9.99 Premium Connectivity subscription. It's worth noting that Grok will simply be an AI chatbot you can ask questions to, but won't be able to interface with the car itself. In other words, Grok can't help you set up directions to your destination, lower the music's volume or control the car's temperature. Instead, it can offer excruciatingly cringe-inducing responses under its "Unhinged" personality, as seen in an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1944053335868297357">X post from Tesla</a>.</p>

Tesla added that Grok may become available to more of its vehicles with over-the-air software updates in the future, but noted that "Grok availability is subject to change or end at any time." Like when Grok went "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html">MechaHitler</a>" only a few days ago and had to be disabled.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/great-grok-is-in-cars-now-too-202153874.html?src=rss
