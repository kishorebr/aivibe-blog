<p>Facebook Dating has added two new AI tools, because clearly a large language model is what the search for love and companionship has been missing all this time. The social media platform introduced a chatbot called dating assistant that can help find prospective dates based on a user&#39;s interests. In the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/facebook-dating-adds-features-address-swipe-fatigue/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> announcing the features, the example Meta provided was &quot;Find me a Brooklyn girl in tech.&quot; The chatbot can also &quot;provide dating ideas or help you level up your profile.&quot; Dating assistant will start a gradual rollout to the Matches tab for users in the US and Canada. And surely everyone will use it in a mature, responsible, not-at-all-creepy fashion.</p>
<p>The other AI addition is Meet Cute, which uses a &quot;personalized matching algorithm&quot; to deliver a surprise candidate that it determines you might like. There&#39;s no explanation in the blog post about how Meta&#39;s algorithm will be assessing potential dates. If you don&#39;t want to see who Meta&#39;s AI thinks would be a compatible match each week, you can opt out of Meet Cute at any time. Both these features are aimed at combatting &quot;swipe fatigue,&quot; so if you&#39;re 1) using Facebook, 2) using Facebook Dating, and 3) are really that tired of swiping, maybe this is the solution you need.</p>
