<p>Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming home for <em>The Office</em> and <em>Love Island USA</em>, is going to cost a good bit more starting on July 23, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/peacock-price-increase-2025-1236463982/"><em>Variety </em>reports</a>. The streaming service's two existing tiers will cost an additional $3 per month, and Peacock will also start testing  a cheaper $7.99 "Select" tier that includes access to NBC and Bravo shows and a limited number of titles from the NBCUniversal back catalog.</p>
<p>With the new price hike, Peacock's ad-supported "Premium" plan will go from costing $8 per month to $11 per month, and the "Premium Plus" plan, which features fewer ads, will go from costing $14 per month to $17 per month. The discounted annual subscription for the Premium plan is now $110 per year, while the Premium Plus plan is $170 per year. The updated subscription fees will go into affect for new and returning customers on July 23, and on August 22 for current customers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While these fees are still on the low end of the $25-per-month that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-raises-subscription-praises-again-with-its-standard-plan-now-costing-18-per-month-234344714.html">Netflix charges</a> for its most premium tier, this is the third time Peacock has raised prices in the last three years. The streaming service's cheapest plan went from $5 to $6 per month <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-raises-subscription-prices-for-the-first-time-164405324.html">in 2023</a>, and then from $6 to $8 per month <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-is-raising-prices-again-just-in-time-for-the-olympics-185457098.html">in 2024</a>. At this rate Peacock subscriptions will cost an additional $4 in 2026.</p>
<p>Peacock hasn't achieved the same level of critical acclaim as competitors like HBO Max or Netflix, but the timing of its price hike does follow a recent hot streak. The most recent season of <em>Love Island USA, </em>which streams exclusively on Peacock, was hugely popular. Nielsen rated the show as "the No. 1 most-watched streaming reality series" multiple weeks in a row in June, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/love-island-usa-heats-peacock-rankings-top-streaming-reality-series">according to NBCUniversal</a>, and the show became Peacock's "most-watched entertainment series on mobile devices, with nearly 30 percent of viewership happening on phones and tablets."</p>
<p>Testing out the new Peacock Select plan seems like a further attempt to capitalize on that reality TV-focused audience. If you're interested in Bravo and whatever shows are exclusive to Peacock, you can pay $8 and get a huge library of episodes to watch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/like-clockwork-peacock-is-raising-subscription-prices-again-203644730.html?src=rss
