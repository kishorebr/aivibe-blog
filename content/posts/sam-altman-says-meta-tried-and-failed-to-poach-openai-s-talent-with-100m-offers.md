Sam Altman went on to say he believes OpenAI’s culture of innovation has been a major key to its success, and that Meta’s “current AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.” The OpenAI CEO said he respects many things about Meta but noted he doesn’t “think they’re a company that’s great at innovation.” Later in the podcast, Altman said he believes it’s not enoug
