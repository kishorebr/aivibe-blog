<p>Jeep says that the all-electric 2026 Jeep Recon will finally begin production &quot;early next year.&quot; This comes three years after the model&#39;s original announcement amid multiple delayed starts.</p>
<p>Built on a dedicated EV architecture, the Recon will deliver 650 horsepower and 620 ft-lb of torque. Its 100kWh battery pack will have an estimated 250 miles of range on a full charge and accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3.6 seconds.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Recon is billed as the first and only fully electric Trail Rated SUV in the industry. This means it meets Jeep&#39;s internal standards for the traction, water fording, maneuverability, articulation and ground clearance necessary to earn the Trail Rated badge. Bolstered by its 4X4 capability and 33-inch tires, the Recon can tackle a wide range of terrains.</p>
<p>The Jeep Recon was originally supposed to be available in 2024, though the closest we got to seeing it in action was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63148542/2025-jeep-recon-ev-spy-photos/"><ins>spy photos</ins></a> of a possible prototype at the tail end of that year. Last month Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/jeep-recon-ev-still-part-of-jeep-plan"><em><ins>MotorTrend</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that the Recon was coming to showrooms &quot;next spring.&quot; The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Jeep;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0ab278a2-a9dc-4f7b-8c37-b5cc88078610&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6fd4d630-0757-4e9e-888a-e1fd842564bf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Jeep&amp;linkText=Jeep+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qZWVwLmNvbS9yZWNvbi5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ZmQ0ZDYzMC0wNzU3LTRlOWUtODg4YS1lMWZkODQyNTY0YmYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplZXAuY29tL3JlY29uLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdoUnh_gDThkas66e9rYsHxbjR1LvwmNCI3D_n4BN5U8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jeep.com%2Frecon.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.jeep.com/recon.html"><ins>Jeep website</ins></a>, which may need some updates, still says &quot;coming late 2025.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeep had previously introduced multiple hybrid models including a hybrid version of the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler. Both models were subject to<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-recalls-more-than-375000-jeep-hybrid-suvs-for-fire-risk-215341226.html"> <ins>substantial recalls</ins></a> this year due to fire risks in their batteries, encompassing over 375,000 vehicles. This came after a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/jeep-recalls-194000-plug-in-hybrids-due-to-fire-risks-150059282.html"><ins>similar recall</ins></a> for Jeep hybrids the year before 194,000 vehicles, also due to fire risks.</p>
<p>The EV will have a starting MSRP of $65,000 and Jeep says production will take place at the Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-all-electric-jeep-recon-gets-official-specs-and-launch-price-000032015.html?src=rss
