The billionaire entrepreneur (and Elon Musk ally) will have his hands full navigating political waters while managing a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-will-lose-over-2000-senior-staff-due-to-proposed-trump-budget-cuts-210109229.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">severely downsized workforce</a>.</p><p>You might recall that this wasn&#39;t Isaacman&#39;s first shot at the job. He was nominated to the post earlier this year. But days before he was scheduled for a confirmation vote, President Donald Trump <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trump-makes-a-last-minute-backtrack-on-his-pick-to-lead-nasa-153253836.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">withdrew his nomination</a>.</p><p>The reversal reportedly came after the president was told that Isaacman had donated to prominent Democrats. (Trump’s description of his decision, as based on a &quot;thorough review of prior associations,&quot; seemed to lend weight to that.) However, that was also around the time the Trump-Musk feud was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-leaves-doge-amid-tanking-tesla-sales-153859407.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">about to boil over</a>.  Regardless, Isaacman was nominated again in November.</p><p>The new NASA head reportedly has broad support from the space community. (That makes him something of an aberration among <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5274744/rfk-confirmation-vaccines-health-secretary" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Trump appointees in scientific fields</a>.) &quot;I am optimistic that Mr. Isaacman will bring a steady hand and clear vision to NASA,&quot; Sen. Marie Cantwell (D-WA) told <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>The new administrator has traveled to space twice on private missions. In a document published in May, Isaacman shared his three objectives for NASA. These included human missions to the Moon, Mars and deep space; helping the organization do more with a constrained budget; and cost-cutting through industry and academic partnerships.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html?src=rss
