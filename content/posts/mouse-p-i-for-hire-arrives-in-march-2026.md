<p>We finally have a release date for <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em>. The delightfully animated game, which marks Troy Baker&#39;s first time playing a rodent private eye, is slated for March 19, 2026.</p>
<p>Based on its trailers, you&#39;d be forgiven for viewing <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> as <em>Cuphead</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. Although it does include FPS action, Engadget&#39;s Jessica Conditt discovered <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-more-to-mouse-pi-for-hire-than-cartoon-violence-203044404.html">surprising depth behind its whimsical brutality</a>. The game &quot;has more to offer than shock-value cartoon violence,&quot; she wrote. &quot;This is a clue-gathering, photo-snapping, girlfriend-avenging, noir detective simulator that happens to star a bunch of slick-talking mice and rats, and I&#39;m fully into it.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Baker <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/troy-baker-is-the-big-cheese-in-mouse-pi-for-hire-220033867.html">plays Private Investigator Jack Pepper</a>, the game&#39;s protagonist. When he isn&#39;t hunting clues or sneaking around during the game&#39;s quieter moments, he&#39;ll have a delightful arsenal on hand. This includes wacky ones like a turpentine gun that melts the inked &quot;skin&quot; of your foes. Fun stuff.</p>
<p>Like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-22-cuphead-hands-on.html"><em>Cuphead</em></a>, <em>Mouse</em>&#39;s most obvious point of comparison, it uses hand-drawn frames to recreate that old-school style. It also deploys an original jazz soundtrack recorded by an orchestral ensemble. It&#39;s all presented in a gritty, film noir aesthetic.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer below. <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> will launch next March on PC, Switch 2, Switch, PS5/4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.</p>
