Other requirements are metrics-based, such as selling a million robots with humanoid qualities, while others are strategic, such as establishing a succession plan for future Tesla leadership. Musk also has a lot of other irons in the fire across SpaceX and xAI, so the incentives may be an effort to keep the CEO focused on generating more money for this specific group of supporters.</p><p>Presently, most times the Tesla name makes headlines, it&#39;s not for good press.
