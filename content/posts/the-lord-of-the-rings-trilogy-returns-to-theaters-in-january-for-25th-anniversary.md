<p>One does not simply spend more than 11 hours watching <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZbG3_mYEn4">The Lord of the Rings trilogy</a>  in a single weekend at home when the opportunity to do so in theaters arises. As <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em> turns 25, Fathom Entertainment and Warner Bros. announced theatrical screenings of the Peter Jackson trilogy in their extended editions, according to an exclusive report from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/lord-of-the-rings-extended-editions-return-to-theaters-1236600677/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p>
<p>The re-releases will be available in DBOX presentations from January 16 to 19, complete with movements and vibrations to make you feel like you&#39;re making the journey to Mordor with Frodo and his entourage. If you prefer a traditional experience, the trilogy will be available in standard format from January 23 to 25.</p>
