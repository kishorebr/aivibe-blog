<p>Microsoft is implementing an age verification system on Xbox accounts to comply with the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act, and in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">a new blog post</a> announcing the move, the company suggests it&#39;ll come to other countries, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players in the UK who indicate on their account that they&#39;re 18 years or older will now &quot;begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age,&quot; Microsoft says. The process is optional for now, and players will be able to enjoy playing Xbox games until &quot;early 2026,&quot; when verification will become mandatory to &quot;retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites.&quot; If you don&#39;t verify, you&#39;ll still be able to make purchases, play games and earn achievements, but social features will be limited to your friends.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says its hopes to learn from its UK program, and &quot;roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future.&quot; The company cautions that the version it introduces in other regions might look different than the &quot;proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check and credit card check&quot; options it&#39;s offering in the UK, but age verification will be the norm.</p>
<p>The UK&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">Online Safety Act</a> was signed in to law in 2023 to ban nonconsensual deepfake porn and create rules preventing children from being exposed to adult content. As regulators have defined ways companies can <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-could-require-facial-scans-or-photo-ids-to-view-online-porn-182019566.html">comply with the law</a>, implementing an age verification system has become the solution most platforms that host adult content have settled on. That&#39;s why Microsoft, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-is-adding-age-verification-features-for-users-in-the-uk-195753332.html">Bluesky</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html">Reddit</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://discord.com/safety/adapting-discord-for-the-uk-online-safety-act">Discord</a> and others have announced age-verification programs in the last few months.</p>
<p>The problem is, no age verification system is foolproof, and in some cases all they take is a photo to circumvent. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord"><em>The Verge </em>reports</a> you can fool Reddit&#39;s age gate with the photo mode in <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, for example. Using a VPN has also proven to be a way to get around age verification tools. If companies take Microsoft&#39;s approach and introduce age verification in more regions, it might get harder to avoid, but widespread adoption has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.eff.org/document/age-verification-harms-users-all-ages">privacy and security implications</a> of its own.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-plans-to-bring-xbox-age-verification-to-countries-outside-of-the-uk-201953614.html?src=rss
