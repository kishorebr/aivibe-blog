<p>On Wednesday, Sony rolled out its September Game Catalog additions for PS Plus subscribers. This month&#39;s entries run the gamut from turn-based tactics to survival horror and pro wrestling.</p>
<p><em>Persona 5 Tactica</em> (PS5/ PS4) may be the most critically acclaimed title in the batch. The 2023 Persona spinoff takes the mainline games&#39; battles and shifts them into grid-based tactics. Think <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/xcom-chimera-squad-steam-pc-release-date-announcement-140116943.html">XCOM</a> with Phantom Thieves.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>The Invincible</em> (PS5) is an adaptation of the 1963 sci-fi <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible">novel</a> by Stanis≈Çaw Lem. As its inspiration may suggest, this isn&#39;t an action-heavy combat-fest. Instead, the narrative adventure invites you to explore the planet Regis III, searching for lost crew members. Your decisions will shape the story, so tread carefully.</p>

<p>If exploring lost worlds as an astrobiologist isn&#39;t your thing, then maybe pile drivers and elbow drops are. (No judgment!) <em>WWE 2K25</em> (PS5 / PS4) is also on this month&#39;s list, letting you step into the ring as a steroid-infused behemoth. You can take satisfaction in knowing your video game match&#39;s outcomes are less pre-determined than the scripted matches you see on TV.</p>
<p>Other games in this month&#39;s entries include the action RPG title <em>Fate / Samurai Remnant</em>, the s<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/crow-country-is-a-darkly-meditative-callback-to-survival-horrors-past-130041405.html">urvival horror game <em>Crow Country</em></a> and the first-person survival sim <em>Green Hell.</em> You can check out the PlayStation Blog&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/">announcement</a> for all the details.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-include-persona-5-tactica-and-wwe-2k25-211006881.html?src=rss
