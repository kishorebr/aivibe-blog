This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews.

    The iPhone Air might not wow serious photographers, but its ultra-thin build and balanced feature set make it a great choice for those on the go.
