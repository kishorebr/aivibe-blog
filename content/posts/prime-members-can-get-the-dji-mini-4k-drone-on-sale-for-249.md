The deal is only for Prime members. This is the lowest price we've seen for this particular model since early in the year.</p> 
<p>The Mini 4K is a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-dji-mini-4k-is-a-299-drone-aimed-at-beginners-130045701.html">beginner-friendly drone</a>, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="f64b63b775ec48e599b8798c7514ffaa" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CXJDDJ9X/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>It offers level-5 wind resistance, which is nice, and can fly for up to 31 minutes per charge. The drone allows for one-tap movements and comes with a dedicated remote. Users can also access the companion app for additional controls and to access flight tutorials.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the coolest feature here is the size and form factor. The Mini 4K is small enough that it doesn't require FAA registration, so you can take it out immediately after unboxing. It's also foldable, making it easy to store when not in use. This particular model didn't make our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-drone-120046775.html">list of the best drones</a>, but its more expensive sibling, the Mini 4 Pro, was our very favorite.</p>
