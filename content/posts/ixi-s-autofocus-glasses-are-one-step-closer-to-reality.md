<p style="text-align:left;">Forget smart glasses, autofocus lenses have the potential to help far more people by offering a high-tech alternative to clunky bifocal and varifocal eyewear. Those traditional solutions involve looking at specific portions of glasses for near and far objects. While that&#39;s more convenient than swapping frames constantly, it requires retraining your eyes a bit and can also lead to eye strain. </p><p style="text-align:left;"><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ixieyewear.com/">Finnish startup IXI&#39;s</a> autofocus glasses aim to go one step further: It has developed eyewear with built-in eye tracking and LCDs that can automatically focus on whatever you&#39;re looking at, just like fixed frame glasses. Even better, they look just like regular eyewear, even more-so than Meta&#39;s thick-framed Ray-Ban smart glasses. While IXI isn&#39;t yet ready to start shipping its hardware yet, the company announced today that it&#39;s one step closer to production by acquiring the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://finnsusp.fi/?lang=en">lens manufacturing company Finnsusp</a> and entering into a &quot;long-term strategic partnership&quot; with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.optiswiss.com/en/home/index.php">OptiSwiss</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IXI-dynamic-eyewear_(1).jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IXI-dynamic-eyewear_(1).jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="IXI&#39;s autofocus frames with built-in LCD" data-uuid="e4a8792d-41d6-4814-ab49-ea19f817ee29"><figcaption>IXI&#39;s autofocus frames with built-in LCD</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IXI</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;">While IXI isn&#39;t the only company working on autofocus frames -- we covered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vixion01-glasses-reduce-eyestrain-by-doing-the-focusing-for-you-205106281.html">ViXion01&#39;s Star Trek-esque glasses</a> at CES last year -- it&#39;s the closest to bringing the technology to normal-looking spectacles. Sure, they&#39;re not as flashy as Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban lineup, and they don&#39;t exactly scream high-tech, but IXI&#39;s reserved approach could make its glasses more compelling to older audiences. Not everyone wants to look like a trendy supergeek, after all, but the idea of having glasses that could make your eyes feel decades younger practically is a huge draw.</p><p style="text-align:left;">IXI has developed &quot;the world&#39;s lowest power eye-tracking&quot; to make its glasses possible, CEO and co-founder Niko Eiden told Engadget in an interview. The company stuffed tiny batteries into the thin frames of its glasses, which Eiden claims can last for a day of usage. The assumption is that you&#39;ll charge them overnight by connecting a cable to their temple area (unfortunately, that also makes them too unwieldy to power up while you&#39;re wearing them). If they do completely lose power, they&#39;ll function purely as far-sighted spectacles. </p><p style="text-align:left;">With the Finnsusp acquisition, IXI will be able to begin low-volume production of its glasses for in-house testing, while the OptiSwiss partnership will eventually help it to scale for the mass market. Eiden says the company isn’t announcing pricing or availability yet, but he expects it to be  in the “high end of existing glasses.” More so than Meta’s hyped-up smart glasses, IXI’s products are targeted at people who are already wearing glasses and who could quickly see the value of in autofocus lenses. Eye degradation comes for us all eventually.   </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocus-glasses-are-one-step-closer-to-reality-060000152.html?src=rss
