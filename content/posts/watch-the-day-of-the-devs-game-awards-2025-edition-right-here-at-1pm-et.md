That’s more than 30 hours before The Game Awards itself kicks off, which makes perfect sense. It is called <em>Day</em> of the Devs, after all, and if we’re judging by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/here-are-the-14-most-interesting-titles-from-the-day-of-the-devs-game-awards-stream-183001600.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">past</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-the-cream-of-the-crop-from-the-day-of-the-devs-game-awards-stream-174701334.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">appearances</a>, the event absolutely deserves its own full 24 hours in the spotlight.</p><p>This year, the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Digital Showcase will feature 22 indie titles, including three release date announcements and six world premieres. That’s a packed show, even by Day of the Devs standards. Expect to see projects from developers including 17-BIT, BONE Assembly, Capybara Games, Deconstructeam and Panic Stations, and publishers Annapurna Interactive, Devolver and Blumhouse Games, among others.</p><p>Each Day of the Devs showcase lasts about an hour and highlights a batch of extremely rad-looking independent games across a wide range of genres, complete with commentary from creators. The featured games are curated by industry veterans at Day of the Devs, and past shows have offered early looks at future hits like <em>Animal Well, Blue Prince, Cocoon, Despelote, Crow Country, Phoenix Springs, Skate Story, UFO 50, Eternights, Sorry We’re Closed</em> and many others.</p><p>Day of the Devs is a non-profit operation that provides a platform for select independent creators to showcase their games to large audiences for free, founded by folks at Double Fine Productions and iam8bit. On top of accepting donations, it receives support from various industry players, including Xbox, PlayStation and Summer Game Fest.</p><p>The Game Awards 2025 begins on Thursday, December 11 at 7:30PM ET, with a half-hour pre-show up first. The whole thing will certainly last longer than one hour, but we’ll find out together whether it’ll have more game reveals than Day of the Devs.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-the-day-of-the-devs-game-awards-2025-edition-right-here-at-1pm-et-060000319.html?src=rss
