<p>Setting your PlayStation 5 as your primary console ensures other users on that system can access your digital games and PlayStation Plus benefits. This includes offline access to your library and shared access for other local profiles on the same device.</p>
<p>This guide explains how to enable Console Sharing and Offline Play on your PS5, along with tips to manage your account and avoid common issues. After all, sharing is caring, and this can be a great way for your squad at home to experience a stack of games at no extra cost, while claiming all the trophies (and the glory) for their own profiles.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-what-console-sharing-and-offline-play-do"><strong>What Console Sharing and Offline Play do</strong></h2>
<p>Console Sharing and Offline Play is the PS5 equivalent of designating a “primary” console. When enabled on your PlayStation 5, it provides the following perks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any local user on that console can play games from your library.</p></li>
<li><p>Any local user can access your PlayStation Plus subscription benefits, including online multiplayer and game catalog access.</p></li>
<li><p>Local users can also play your digital games without an internet connection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is tied to your PlayStation Network (PSN) account and can only be active on one PS5 console at a time. Therefore, if you sign into a new console and activate this setting, it will be disabled on the previous system.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-before-you-begin"><strong>Before you begin</strong></h2>
<p>To set your PS5 as your home console, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An active PlayStation Network account</p></li>
<li><p>A stable internet connection is required to enable the feature initially</p></li>
<li><p>Physical access to the console where you want to activate Console Sharing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also confirm that your account is the one used to purchase digital games or subscribe to PlayStation Plus. This ensures shared access will work correctly.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-step-by-step-how-to-set-your-ps5-as-your-home-console"><strong>Step-by-step: How to set your PS5 as your home console</strong></h2>
<p>Follow these instructions to enable Console Sharing and Offline Play:</p>
<p><strong>Sign in with your main account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Turn on your PlayStation 5 and log in to the PSN account that owns the games and subscription.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Go to Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the Home screen, select the gear icon in the top-right corner to open the Settings menu.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Select Users and Accounts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scroll down and open the “Users and Accounts” section.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Navigate to Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the left sidebar, scroll to and select “Other.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose the option labeled “Console Sharing and Offline Play.” This section controls access to your games and services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enable the feature</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the feature is currently disabled, select “Enable.” You will see a confirmation message that this PS5 is now your active console for sharing and offline access.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once enabled, other user profiles on the console will be able to launch your digital games and use PlayStation Plus features. You will also retain access to your library even when disconnected from the internet.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-check-or-disable-console-sharing"><strong>How to check or disable Console Sharing</strong></h2>
<p>You can return to the same settings page to check if Console Sharing is active. If you see “Disable” as the available option, the feature is currently turned on for that console.</p>
<p>If you want to remove access or switch primary status to another console, select “Disable” to turn off Console Sharing on your current system. Then, repeat the setup steps on your new console.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-important-limitations-and-rules"><strong>Important limitations and rules</strong></h2>
<p>There are a few restrictions you should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Only one active console</strong>: You can only enable Console Sharing and Offline Play on one PS5 per account. Activating it on a second system will automatically deactivate it on the first. For example, if you enable it on your console at home and then go to a friend’s place and activate it on their PS5, it will deactivate the feature on your home console.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No remote deactivation option</strong>: Unlike previous console generations, you cannot deactivate this feature from a web browser. You must do it manually from the console or activate a new one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Game sharing applies locally only</strong>: Console Sharing only applies to users on the same PS5. It does not let others on different consoles access your content, even if they are signed into your account elsewhere.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network issues may affect access</strong>: While offline play is supported, some Digital Rights Management-protected (DRM) content may occasionally require a revalidation online. DRM is a form of access control technology that limits the copying, distribution and use of digital media to authorized users. So with this in mind, it’s a good idea to launch games at least once while connected to the internet after downloading.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-common-scenarios"><strong>Common scenarios</strong></h2>
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-games-with-family">Sharing games with family</h3>
<p>If multiple people use the same PS5, enabling Console Sharing allows each user to access the same game library without needing to purchase extra copies. Each person can have their own profile and saves while still playing the same titles, nipping any gaming-related arguments in the bud before they happen.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-playing-offline">Playing offline</h3>
<p>If your internet connection is unreliable or you plan to use your PS5 in a location without internet access, enabling this feature ensures your downloaded games and PS Plus benefits remain accessible.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-upgrading-or-replacing-your-console">Upgrading or replacing your console</h3>
<p>If you purchase a new PS5 or switch devices, you will need to re-enable Console Sharing on the new console. However, make sure to disable this feature on the old system before selling or giving it away. If you forget to do this, it will remain active on your old console until you enable it on the new one.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-happens-if-you-dont-enable-console-sharing"><strong>What happens if you don’t enable Console Sharing</strong></h2>
<p>If Console Sharing is turned off:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only the account that purchased the games will be able to launch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Other users on the same console will be blocked from opening digital games tied to your account.</p></li>
<li><p>PlayStation Plus features like online play and game catalog access will not be shared.</p></li>
<li><p>You may lose access to your games when offline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling Console Sharing ensures uninterrupted access for all users and prevents unexpected restrictions, especially during outages or while gaming away from home. It only takes a few minutes to set up, but it can save you plenty of headaches.</p>
<p>Setting your PS5 as your home console by enabling Console Sharing and Offline Play ensures that you and other users on the same system can access your digital library and PlayStation Plus features. It’s a one-time process that helps avoid re-downloads, account switching, or unnecessary duplicate purchases. While only one PS5 can be linked at a time, switching is easy through the system settings.</p>
<p>As long as you remember it only applies to one console at a time, Console Sharing and Offline Play can make your PS5 experience smoother for both you and anyone else using it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-set-your-ps5-as-your-home-console-120059735.html?src=rss
