<p>We’ve somehow almost reached the end of January already, which means it’s time for Sony to divulge <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the list of PlayStation Plus Monthly Games for February</a>. They are <em>Undisputed</em>, <em>Subnautica: Below Zero, Ultros</em> and <em>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</em>. If you have a PS Plus subscription on any tier, you can claim these starting on February 3. After claiming them, these games will stay in your library as long as your PS Plus plan remains active.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Undisputed</em> (PS5) is a 2024 boxing game with dozens of licensed fighters across several weight classes. They include legendary figures like Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson as well as modern greats including Canelo Alvarez and Oleksandr Usyk.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/subnautica-below-zero-full-release-may-170018659.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em></a> (PS4 and PS5) is a spin-off from adventure survival game <em>Subnautica</em>. It has more land-based areas to explore than the original game and you’ll need to keep an eye on a body temperature meter to make sure you stay warm enough.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been meaning to check out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ultros-and-the-palette-of-surreal-sci-fi-160023230.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Ultros</em></a><em> </em>(PS4 and PS5) for a while and its inclusion here is almost enough to make me want to re-subscribe to PS Plus. It&#39;s a Metroidvania with a striking neon palette. As for <em>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</em> (PS4), that could be a good way for folks to dip back into the long-running combat flight sim series (or try it for the first time) before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</em></a> arrives later this year.</p><p>PS Plus subscribers still have until February 2 to add the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/januarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-need-for-speed-unbound-and-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-182335673.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Monthly Games for January</a> to their library. Those are <em>Need For Speed Unbound, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> and<em> Core Keeper.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/februarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-undisputed-and-subnautica-below-zero-205100847.html?src=rss
