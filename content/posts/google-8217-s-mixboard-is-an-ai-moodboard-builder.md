<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/mixboard/">launching a new AI concepting tool</a> that lets you create moodboards to explore design ideas. The Mixboard Google Labs experiment gives users an open canvas to create projects from pre-populated board templates or text prompts using <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/">Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The experimental tool is available through public beta in the US. The format is visually similar to platforms like FigJam or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/moodboard.html#">Adobe’s Firefly Boards</a>, so this isn’t a unique concept, but it&#8217;s interesting to see Google developing more design-based apps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mixboard users can add their own images, or generate visuals with descriptions like “show me cups, bowls, and plates in Memphis style,” or “plan an autumn party in my living room.” The tool can be used to explore ideas for decorating your home, planning events, or just creating an ensemble of amusing images for entertainment — similar to Pinterest boards. Google says that users can edit boards with natural language prompts to adjust or combine images, or reference uploaded images to generate new visuals. One-click options also enable users to quickly regenerate images or generate similar-looking designs.</p>
