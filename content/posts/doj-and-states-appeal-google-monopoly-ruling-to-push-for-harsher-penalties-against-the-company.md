<p>Google might have been officially <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopolist-in-search-us-judge-rules-in-antitrust-case-193358356.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ruled</a> to have a monopoly, but we&#39;re still a long way from figuring out exactly what that determination will change at the tech company. Today, the US Department of Justice filed notice of a plan to cross-appeal the decision last fall that Google would <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-doesnt-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-in-monopoly-case-rules-211032326.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">not be required</a> to sell off the its Chrome browser. The agency&#39;s Antitrust Division <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/justiceatr/status/2018795567405547988" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">posted</a> about the action on X. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/google-search-remedy-to-be-appealed-by-state-attorneys-general?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, a group of states is also joining the appeal filing.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of the 2025 ruling, the Justice Department had pushed for a Chrome sale to be part of the outcome. Judge Amit Mehta denied the request from the agency. &quot;Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints,&quot; Mehta&#39;s decision stated. However, he did set other restrictions on Google&#39;s business activities, such as an end to exclusive deals for distributing some services and a requirement to share select search data with competitors.</p><p>Google has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-appealing-the-ruling-from-its-search-antitrust-case-to-avoid-sharing-data-with-rivals-215107905.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">filed its own appeal</a> over this part of its ongoing antitrust battle. Of course, the tech giant is hoping to get off the hook with fewer penalties rather than the heavier ones the DOJ is seeking.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/doj-and-states-appeal-google-monopoly-ruling-to-push-for-harsher-penalties-against-the-company-235115249.html?src=rss
