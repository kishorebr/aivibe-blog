Tesla sued a former engineer for allegedly stealing trade secrets from its humanoid robotics program, Optimus, and using them to launch a rival startup.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday and originally reported on by Bloomberg, accuses Zhongjie “Jay” Li of stealing trade secrets regarding Tesla’s development of “advanced robotic hand sensors” to launch his startup Proception, a Y Combinator-backed company building robotic hands.


	
	




	
	



The complaint states that Li, who worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024, downloaded confidential information about Optimus on two separate personal smartphones.

The complaint also added that during the last few months of his time at Tesla, Li researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his workplace computer in addition to making internet searches regarding venture capital and other startup funding sources.

“Less than a week after he left Tesla, Proception was incorporated,” the complaint stated. “And within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have ‘successfully built’ advanced humanoid robotic hands—hands that bear a striking resemblance to the designs Li worked on at Tesla.”

Proception’s website states the company is working to “revolutionize human-robot interaction by building the world’s most advanced humanoid hands.”

TechCrunch reached out to Proception and Tesla for more information.
