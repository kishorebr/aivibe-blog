High school’s AI security system confuses Doritos bag for a possible firearm


A high school student in Baltimore County, Maryland was reportedly handcuffed and searched after an AI security system flagged his bag of chips as a possible firearm.

Taki Allen, a student at Kenwood High School, told CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” But as a result, Allen said, “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me.” 


	
	




	
	



In a statement shared with parents, Principal Katie Smith said the school’s security department had reviewed and canceled a gun detection alert, while Smith (who didn’t immediately realize the alert had been canceled) reported the situation to the school resource officer, who called the local police.

Omnilert, the company that operates the AI gun detection system, told CNN, “We regret that this incident occurred and wish to convey our concern to the student and the wider community affected by the events that followed.” Nonetheless, Omnilert said “the process functioned as intended.”
