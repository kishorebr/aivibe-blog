And there appear to be quite a few of them.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">This type of hacked information may not be an accurate reflection of Game Freak&#39;s actual plans, and any alleged details about the games may not appear in final iterations of the studio&#39;s titles. And even if these files are genuine, some of the planning documents are supposedly </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977775973098524811" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">from 2020</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, so hardly the freshest info. With those caveats in mind, here&#39;s an overview of what the datamining revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The leaker claims that the Gen 10 game will be called <em>Pokémon Wind and Waves</em>. Its theme is &quot;infinity&quot; and the project is slated for a 2026 release with a DLC planned for 2027. The datamine also revealed that an early build of the game treated the central area as an MMO-style lobby, where players could see and interact with each other as well as access quest boards. <em>Wind and Waves</em> could also have an MMO raid boss and may give players the ability to explore underwater.&nbsp;A bunch of other </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">details</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> about the plot, characters and mechanics may have been uncovered in the leak.</span></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokémon Project Seed is not only the dream multi-region Pokémon game that people have always asked for, it also appears to be an MMO.<br><br>&quot;Seed is a prototyping project for a next-generation online game playable by multiple people, set in a region that connects Hoenn and Sinnoh&quot; <a href="https://t.co/JPN5tAJfr5">https://t.co/JPN5tAJfr5</a></p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977803554770604239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Other Pokémon projects reportedly in the works at Game Freak include another new Pokémon Legends game set in Galar that&#39;s slated for 2027 and beyond. A multi-region Pokémon remake, internally called Project Seed, may be released in 2028. The datamined leaks suggest this game also seems to be exploring some online multiplayer mechanics as well as letting players walk freely between different regions from past titles, which sure sounds like it could be a full-on Pokémon MMO.
