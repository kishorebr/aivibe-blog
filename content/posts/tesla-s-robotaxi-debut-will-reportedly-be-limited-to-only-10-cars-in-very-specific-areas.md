If issues arise, remote operators will also reportedly be able to take control of the cars to make sure they reach their final destination.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk told<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/20/elon-musk-confirms-tesla-plan-for-robotaxis-on-austin-roads-in-june.html"> <em>CNBC</em></a> in May that the robotaxi service might launch with less than a dozen cars, so that's not necessarily a surprise, but the actual scope may be even smaller. Analysts <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/business/tesla-robotaxi-austin-elon-musk.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>spoke to believe rides in Tesla's robotaxi will only be available to "company employees or invited guests." It could take months before the service is made available to the wider public.</p>

The pitch goes that since all Teslas are equipped with the cameras necessary for the company's self-driving system, any of them can be converted into a cab while not in use. Musk believes autonomous transport could be so widespread that it becomes as cheap as mass transit, while being safer than relying on a human driver.</p>
<p>Whether the company's Full Self Driving system can pull that off is an open question.
