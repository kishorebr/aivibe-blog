<p>Another hot <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">streaming deal</a> is here to match the summer heat. This time is comes from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount Plus;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=68b46bf3-c565-40f8-a351-20ccfc720b5e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;linkText=Paramount%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY4YjQ2YmYzLWM1NjUtNDBmOC1hMzUxLTIwY2NmYzcyMGI1ZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeqiaxREOtRbJ98aiXis1J9zsiCptMP707MpBleSWYlM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a>, which is offering a two-month subscription for only $2. Put another way, you'll pay $1 per month for your first two months â€” but the deal is only valid through today, July 13.</p> 
<p>The kicker for this deal is that is applies to two subscription tiers: you can either choose the ad-supported Essential plan or the ad-free Premium plan and the deal price remains the same. That means new subscribers will save $14 on the standard price of the Essential tier, or $24 on the price of the Premium plan.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Paramount+ is a decent service and made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">best streaming platforms</a>. It started as a home for all things Star Trek, but that particular bonus is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-lower-decks-ends-on-a-new-beginning-140003832.html">shrinking all of the time</a>.

The third season of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> premieres on July 17.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It also hosts original programming like the Sonic-adjacent <em>Knuckles</em> TV show and the dad-friendly <em>Tulsa King</em>. Paramount owns CBS, so subscribers can also access much of that network's programming. This includes stuff like <em>The Amazing Rac</em>e, <em>Blue Bloods</em> and several CSI entries.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that subscriptions will auto-renew if you forget to cancel. Set a reminder to kick in at the end of the second month if you want to avoid that.</p>
