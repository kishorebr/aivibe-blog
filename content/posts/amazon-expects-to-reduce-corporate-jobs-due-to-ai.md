			Amazon expects to reduce corporate jobs due to AI

			
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is betting that generative AI will change how the company thinks about its workforce in the future.

Jassy said that as the company continues to roll out more AI agents, and thus change how the company’s work is done, he expects Amazon will reduce the number of corporate jobs needed in the future, according to a memo that was first covered by CNBC.


	
	




	
	



“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in the memo.

He added that the size of this future reduction of workforce is hard to estimate.

A recent survey from the World Economic Forum found that potential reductions in workforce due to AI may already be happening. The survey found that 40% of employers plan to cut staff that are doing roles that can be automated by AI.
