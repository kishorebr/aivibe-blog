<p><em>The Crew 2</em>  was updated today to include <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cca828bc-bcd7-4319-b5fa-8cb88f52eae1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=69a5a23b-7d39-4853-a9cd-5707075a3723&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ubisoft&amp;linkText=Hybrid+Mode&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lL3RoZS1jcmV3L3RoZS1jcmV3LTIvbmV3cy11cGRhdGVzL3pzNlpGeUxFUXZLYkZza0VKWm9sUiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjlhNWEyM2ItN2QzOS00ODUzLWE5Y2QtNTcwNzA3NWEzNzIzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lL3RoZS1jcmV3L3RoZS1jcmV3LTIvbmV3cy11cGRhdGVzL3pzNlpGeUxFUXZLYkZza0VKWm9sUiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQIUy5mnNRqI71kTJbE7FlGMvnApYkYAnurcoC6S3dQ8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fgame%2Fthe-crew%2Fthe-crew-2%2Fnews-updates%2Fzs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Ubisoft;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR">Hybrid Mode</a>, adding an offline mode to the driving game. Online and offline modes are separate saves, so if you snag a sweet ride while playing offline, it won&#39;t be available the next time you join an online session. Players will have the option to re-export their online save to the offline one, but it will overwrite and erase all offline-only progress. Multiplayer content, user-generated content, LIVE Summits and Crew Credits purchases will not be available in the offline mode.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a bare-bones option, but the addition of offline mode is a welcome move from Ubisoft.

One of the notable voices emerging from that conversation was the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Stop Killing Games</a> movement, which is pushing for EU legislation to ensure access to games even after their devs stop supporting a project.</p><p>Having a way to continue accessing <em>The Crew 2</em> even if (or more likely when) the game loses online support was something the developer had promised, so it&#39;s nice to have Ubisoft follow through. &quot;Whether you&#39;re looking to preserve your progression for the future or simply enjoy the freedom of playing without a connection, Hybrid Mode ensures <em>The Crew 2</em> remains accessible for years to come,&quot; the company said in the blog post.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-crew-2-is-now-playable-offline-211629508.html?src=rss
