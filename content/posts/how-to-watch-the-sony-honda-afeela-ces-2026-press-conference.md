<p>Sony&#39;s CES 2026 press conference is just days away, but this year has a twist: Instead of an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will apparently have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. This year, however, we&#39;ll also apparently get to see a an all-new concept model at the event, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@shmafeela">Afeela official YouTube channel</a>. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)</p>

<p>What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html">since CES 2020</a>, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html">feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era</a>,&quot; and that &quot;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&quot; Ouch.</p>
<p>But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048622.html?src=rss
