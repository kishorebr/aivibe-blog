One of the key elements here is the organization's foundation models for AI, which serve as a base for building more specialized applications.Also: 4 questions to ask yourself before betting on AI in your business - and why While tech analysts like Gartner suggest there is much conjecture about whether business leaders should buy or build AI models, Jethwa and his team at OS combine foundation models with commercially available tools to exploit and distribute geospatial data. Here are five key lessons that business leaders can learn from Jethwa's deployment of foundation models for AI.1. Develop a strong use caseJethwa said OS is developing foundation models to extract environmental features for analysis in a copyright-sensitive manner."Many of the existing models trained by the large technology organizations will be based on commercially available data," he said.OS benefits from a long history of high-precision data collection that feeds
