<p>Whew, it's been a crazy few weeks for us at Engadget. School may still be out, but there's no summer break for the steady stream of new gadgets coming across our desks. I'll forgive you if you missed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/">a review or two</a> over the last few weeks — we've been busy. Here's a quick rundown of what we've been up to, just in time for you to catch up over the weekend.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-z-flip-7">Samsung Z Flip 7</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="ef05730552614d19859ec2f0b9c99174" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7K3FZ79/ref=sr_1_3?crid=14SIRPJBSTVWK&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Zt2hkWNouosIswpKi4woRfj1wp6L-abCwkGDHjtUG1qHJP-VyTFefqekKr2M8Bl0ey-0u6dfrhfGuZbyQNJi2uXUfi8dff4rVqaeA4ZH4SjjJh7fIeGQVpXoxZpqZm-LcDzSJMbKmGzqVAr_4axcRT5NWh1GAJDLMWe3J5hFAK3qPoceGspHolVn-BgnBr_TicYAvaxPYCXQkPjiRqNvFztXmRRQHkgq71ikbUHgQY8.aO9JpLWVTHTA_Hh5ZVlFbZ3o8cjExEqZ5kdlWXVgnTw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=z%2Bflip%2B7&amp;qid=1753437954&amp;sprefix=z%2Bfli%2Caps%2C170&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Alongside the Z Fold 7, Samsung debuted an updated version of its more compact foldable, the Z Flip 7. UK bureau chief Mat Smith noted that the company managed to provide a substantial overhaul, but there are some areas that were left untouched. "Certain aspects of the Flip 7 are lacking, most notably the cameras, which haven’t been changed since last year," <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review-140022250.html">he said</a>. "Samsung also needs to put more work into its Flex Window."</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-oakley-meta-glasses">Oakley Meta glasses</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="9ac67199a7c54e58ad075e2a26b4ae35" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-warm-grey-prizm-24k-polarized/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Meta's first non-Ray-Ban smart glasses have arrived. While we wait for a more affordable version to get here, senior editor Karissa Bell put the white and gold option through its paces. "While I don't love the style of the Oakley Meta HSTN frames, Meta has shown that it's been consistently able to improve its glasses," <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html">she wrote</a>. "The upgrades that come with the new Oakley frames aren't major leaps, but they deliver improvements to core features."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-dji-osmo-360">DJI Osmo 360</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="a16d1b6440684d0f8670c88c61d2c5bf" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.dji.com/360"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Reporter Steve Dent argued that DJI is finally giving Insta360 some competition in the 360-degree action cam space. The design and performance of the Osmo 360 are great, but the problem comes when it's time to edit. "The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work," <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html">he explained</a>. "For a first effort, though, the Osmo 360 is a surprisingly solid rival to Insta360’s X5."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-nothing-phone-3">Nothing Phone 3</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="61dfa6a22401461c9c0cde7a5e9de49b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3?srsltid=AfmBOopcUyIpIMn81tOwXsVK9ped3FD2NCvGBZN0Oa-VY6dUeaeNJDd9&amp;Colour=White&amp;Capacity=16%2B512+GB"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Nothing's first "true flagship" phone has arrived, ready to take on the likes of the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25. Despite the company's lofty chatter, Mat argued the Nothing Phone 3 is hampered by a lower-power chip and disappointing cameras. "While I want Nothing to continue experimenting with its phones, it should probably prioritize shoring up the camera performance first," <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-review-143006151.html">he said</a>.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="ce6288b5458945d2bb1acb74cd80bbf0" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching/dp/B0F7PN7C8Z?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Samsung debuted a big update to its Galaxy Watch line when it unveiled the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. Senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks testing the new wearable, which impressed her so much she declared it was "Samsung's best smartwatch in years." You can read her in-depth review <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-review-samsungs-best-smartwatch-in-years-155857108.html">here</a>.</p>
