<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/pixel-buds-pro-2-review-tiny-earbuds-with-big-sound-and-a-direct-line-to-gemini-170016328.html">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> now get an Adaptive Audio feature in the Active Noise Control section of the Pixel Buds app. This ANC mode automatically adjusts the volume depending on your surrounding environment, balancing between hearing your music or podcasts and the world around you. If you want to drown out the outside world a little more, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 now also have the Loud Noise Protection feature, which can detect and reduce any sudden loud noises, like a passing ambulance siren or construction work.

Google is rolling out its 4.467 update to its users gradually, which takes about 10 minutes to download and another 10 minutes to install.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/pixel-buds-pro-2-get-adaptive-audio-gesture-controls-and-more-in-latest-update-155116813.html?src=rss
