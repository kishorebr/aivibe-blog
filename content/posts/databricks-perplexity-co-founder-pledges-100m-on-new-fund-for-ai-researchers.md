Andy Konwinski, computer scientist and co-founder of Databricks and Perplexity, announced Monday that his company, Laude, is forming a new AI research institute backed with $100 million of his own money.

The Laude Institute functions less as an AI research lab and more like a fund looking to make investments structured similar to grants. In addition to Konwinski, the institute’s board includes UC Berkeley professor Dave Patterson (known for a string of award-winning research), Jeff Dean (known as Google’s chief scientist), and Joelle Pineau (Meta’s vice president of AI Research).


	
	




	
	



Konwinski announced the institute’s first and “flagship” grant of $3 million annually for five years, which will anchor the new AI Systems Lab at UC Berkeley. This is a new lab led by one of Berkeley’s most celebrated researchers, Ion Stoica, current director of the Sky Computing Lab. Stoica is also a co-founder of startup Anyscale (an AI and Python platform) and AI big data company Databricks, both built from tech developed in Berkeley’s lab system. 

The new AI Systems Lab is set to open in 2027 and in addition to Stoica will include a number of other well-known researchers.

In his blog post announcing the institute, Konwinski described its mission as ”built by and for computer science researchers … We exist to catalyze work that doesn’t just push the field forward but guides it towards more beneficial outcomes.”

That’s not necessarily a direct dig at OpenAI, which started out as an AI research facility and is now, arguably, consumed by its enormous commercial side. But other researchers have fallen prey to the lure of money as well. 

For instance, popular AI researcher Epoch faced controversy when it revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks that was then used to unveil its new o3 model. Epoch’s founder also launched a startup with the controversial mission to replace all human workers everywhere with AI agents.
