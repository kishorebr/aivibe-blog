ChatGPT is pulling answers from Elon Musk’s Grokipedia


Information from the conservative-leaning, AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI is beginning to appear in answers from ChatGPT.

xAI launched Grokipedia in October, after Musk had been complaining that Wikipedia was biased against conservatives. Reporters soon noted that while many articles seemed to be copied directly from Wikipedia, Grokipedia also claimed that pornography contributed to the AIDS crisis, offered “ideological justifications” for slavery, and used denigrating terms for transgender people.


	
	




	
	



All that might be expected for an encyclopedia associated with a chatbot that described itself as “Mecha Hitler” and was used to flood X with sexualized deepfakes. However, its content now seems to be escaping containment from the Musk ecosystem, with the Guardian reporting that GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions.

The Guardian says ChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when asked about topics where its inaccuracy has been widely reported— topics like the January 6 insurrection or the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Instead, it was cited on more obscure topics, including claims about Sir Richard Evans that the Guardian had previously debunked. (Anthropic’s Claude also appears to be citing Grokipedia to answer some queries.)

An OpenAI spokesperson told the Guardian that it “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints.”
