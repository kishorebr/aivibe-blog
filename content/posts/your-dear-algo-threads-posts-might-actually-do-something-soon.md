<p>In a lot of social media use, the algorithm is an intangible entity, silent and all-powerful in controlling what we see in our feeds. And like supplicants to a deity, sometimes we may find ourselves calling into the void, hoping to receive aid from that mighty being. Seems that for Threads users, at least, those prayers have been heard.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people on the Threads platform have taken to writing posts with the phrase &quot;dear algo,&quot; politely asking the network algorithm to show them more of what they want or less of what they don&#39;t. According to a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0F9gkEj1q" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">post</a> today from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Threads will try out a feature where that&#39;s exactly what happens. Connor Hayes, head of Threads, also posted about this limited test, adding that it will be an AI-powered feature. &quot;When people add “Dear Algo” to a post, it will tell your feed what you want to see more or less of for up to three days,&quot; he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@conno_r/post/DR0H53pkmAR" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">wrote</a>. &quot;If your profile is public, people can see your request, connect with you about it, or repost it.&quot;</p><p>There is something satisfying about having users&#39; feedback taken seriously, even if it started as a bit of a joke. Threads has seen rapid growth since its debut in 2023. It had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-up-to-400-million-monthly-active-users-190203754.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">400 million</a> monthly active users as of August 2025 and in October it reached <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-reaches-150-million-daily-users-and-is-ramping-up-ads-214259945.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">150 million</a> daily active users. </p><p><strong>Update, December 3, 2025, 5:15PM ET: </strong>Added more detail from Connor Hayes about the tests.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/your-dear-algo-threads-posts-might-actually-do-something-soon-215448062.html?src=rss
