<p>Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators to AI assistants and rolling robots. But for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1766177037453611&amp;usg=AOvVaw2s0tafHDwWnqYKUQHC4zuC"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a>, the company is shaking up the schedule a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference position, the Korean giant will front-run the entire show with a Sunday night presentation.</p>
<p>Samsung has already given a few hints as to what&#39;s on the agenda, but what we&#39;re really hoping to see is an update on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html"><ins>Ballie robot</ins></a> — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html"><ins>2025 release date</ins></a>.</p>

<p>The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/"><ins>Samsung Newsroom</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung"><ins>Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel</ins></a> or via Samsung TV Plus. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)</p>

<p>Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &quot;new AI-driven customer experiences,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look"><ins>said in a press release</ins></a>. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &quot;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&quot;</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its &quot;Advent calendar&quot; approach to early CES announcements, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/"><ins>new press releases</ins></a> dropping nearly each day. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html"><ins>micro RGB TVs</ins></a> (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026"><ins>Bespoke AI</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s likely Samsung will map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we&#39;ll update this story accordingly when it does.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-190027604.html?src=rss
