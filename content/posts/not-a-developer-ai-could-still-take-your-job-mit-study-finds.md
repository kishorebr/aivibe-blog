But what if those roles were just the tip of the iceberg?Also: AI could double the US economy's growth rate over the next decade, says AnthropicMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published a study last week indicating that, indeed, the scale and distribution of AI-fueled automation is likely to be much more extensive than previously believed. Titled "Project Iceberg," the study found that current AI systems can already replace 11.7% of the US workforce, representing around $1.2 trillion of the total value of the country's labor market (which is worth more than $9.4 trillion total, according to the report). Key findingsThe study was based on a large-scale computer simulation of the US labor force powered by the Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The researchers leveraged what they call "Large Population Models" -- AI systems that can represent the interplay of 151 million workers across 3,000 US counties, and exhibiting 32,000 individual workplace skills. The goal was to develop a detailed map of the particular jo
