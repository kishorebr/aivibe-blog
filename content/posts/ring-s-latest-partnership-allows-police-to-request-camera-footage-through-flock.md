<p>Amazon&#39;s Ring brand is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-expands-community-requests-to-additional-community-safety-partners/" data-i13n="slk:entering into a new partnership;cpos:1;pos:1">entering into a new partnership</a> with surveillance company Flock Safety to make it possible for law enforcement to request footage from smart doorbell owners. The move is part of a pivot back to collaborating with police, after Ring spent several years distancing itself and its products from law enforcement agencies.</p><p>As part of the partnership, &quot;public safety agencies&quot; using Flock&#39;s Nova platform or FlockOS will be able to use Ring&#39;s previously announced &quot;Community Requests&quot; program to receive footage captured by the camera of a Ring customer. Agencies investigating an event that might have been captured on camera will have to provide details like the &quot;specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated&quot; before the request is passed on to relevant users. Throughout the process, the identity of Ring users is kept anonymous, as is whether they agree to share footage. The entire process is also entirely optional.</p><p>Amazon and Ring&#39;s approach to working with law enforcement has varied over the years. While Ring reportedly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-is-reportedly-walking-back-its-police-friendly-stance-on-data-sharing-191514423.html" data-i13n="slk:removed the ability;cpos:2;pos:1">removed the ability</a> for police to make warrantless video requests in 2024, there were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-law-enforcement-disclosure-224557384.html" data-i13n="slk:documented cases;cpos:3;pos:1">documented cases</a> of the company providing access to law enforcement in years prior. This pivot back towards a more police-friendly stance might have been prompted by Ring founder Jamie Siminoff <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ring-founder-jamie-siminoff-is-back-at-amazon-to-run-its-video-doorbell-unit-130009731.html" data-i13n="slk:returning to the Amazon-subsidiary;cpos:4;pos:1">returning to the Amazon-subsidiary</a> in April 2025. Now Amazon is reportedly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-is-reportedly-aggressively-pitching-law-enforcement-on-its-cloud-services-215334082.html" data-i13n="slk:pitching its cloud and AI services;cpos:5;pos:1">pitching its cloud and AI services</a> to law enforcement agencies and Ring is looking to work with Flock and other surveillance companies.</p><p>That might not bother the average Ring customer who already planned to opt out of sharing, but there&#39;s reasons to be concerned that Amazon is budding up with Flock. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" data-i13n="slk:404 Media reports;cpos:6;pos:1"><em>404 Media </em>reports</a> the company&#39;s surveillance tools have been used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to find and detain people, without a formal contract. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/" data-i13n="slk:Navy and Secret Service employees;cpos:7;pos:1">Navy and Secret Service employees</a> also reportedly had access to Flock&#39;s network. That doesn&#39;t implicate Ring in anything, but it does make the connection between the two camera networks feel more fraught.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/rings-latest-partnership-allows-police-to-access-camera-footage-through-flock-194609879.html?src=rss
