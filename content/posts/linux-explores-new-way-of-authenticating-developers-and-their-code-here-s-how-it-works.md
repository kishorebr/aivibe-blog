    Linux explores new way of authenticating developers and their code - here's how it works
     
    Linux kernel maintainers propose a less painful process for identifying developers. See how it can make Linux code safer than ever.

(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I really wanna know!" Linux kernel maintainers have the same question: Who are their programmers, and how can the kernel community be sure the code they submit is really theirs? For decades, Linux kernel developers used Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to identify developers and their release artifacts. Git's PGP integration enabled signed tags to verify code repository integrity and signed commits to prevent hackers from impersonating legitimate developers. Also: The latest Linux kernel release closes out the 6.x era - and it's a gift to cloud adminsIn 2011, hackers successfully cracked the main Linux development site, kernel.org. Afterward, to make sure this didn't happen again, the kernel's PGP web of trust was explicitly "bootstrapped" at a face-to-face key‑signing session during the 2011 Kernel Summit.More recently, the xz utility was compromised by a malicious developer, almost leading to malware infecting Linux. A painful processToday, kernel maintainers who want a kernel.org account must find someone already in the PGP web of trust, meet them fa
