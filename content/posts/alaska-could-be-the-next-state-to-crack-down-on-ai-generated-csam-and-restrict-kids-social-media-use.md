<p>Alaska&#39;s House of Representatives unanimously passed <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/34?Root=HB%20%2047#tab1_4">HB47</a>, a bill that imposes sweeping limits on when and how minors use social media apps, along with bans on generating or distributing harmful <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-mother-of-one-of-elon-musks-children-is-suing-xai-over-nonconsensual-deepfake-images-191451979.html">deepfakes</a> of children.</p>
<p>The bill&#39;s original form was focused on prohibiting the possession and distribution of sexually explicit images of children using AI, but Alaska lawmakers decided to add amendments that would impose social media restrictions. The proposed limitations include a statewide curfew on using social media between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM, banning &quot;addictive design features&quot; and requiring social media platforms to verify user ages and get parental consent if they are minors.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the House bill saw 39 votes in favor and zero against, the amendments offered some hints at potential upcoming revisions. Before the bill went to a vote, some of the House representatives expressed concern about adding such broad rules on social media without consulting the companies behind them first.</p>
<p>The bill still has to make its way through the Alaska State Senate, which already has presented a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/?Root=SB%20247">companion bill</a>, and the governor. Alaska is following the footsteps of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html">many other states</a>, and the House even modeled its social media amendments in the HB47 bill after Utah. While Utah was the first to propose social media restrictions for kids, it was later met with a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/utah-judge-blocks-law-preventing-youth-from-accessing-social-media-freely-160008587.html">preliminary injunction</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/alaska-could-be-the-next-state-to-crack-down-on-ai-generated-csam-and-restrict-kids-social-media-use-190506366.html?src=rss
