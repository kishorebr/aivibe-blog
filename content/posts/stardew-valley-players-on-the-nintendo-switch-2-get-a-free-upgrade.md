However, fans have reported some bugs following the free release, and Eric Barone, the game&#39;s developer that&#39;s better known as ConcernedApe, is working on fixes.</p>
<p>If you have <em>Stardew</em> <em>Valley</em> on the Switch 2, you can download the Upgrade Pack that introduces mouse controls to make it easier to place furniture and organize your inventory. The upgrade also adds local split-screen co-op for up to four players and online multiplayer that maxes out at eight players. On top of the co-op modes, the free content pack includes Game Share compatibility, meaning only one player needs a copy of <em>Stardew Valley</em> to share it with three others.</p>
