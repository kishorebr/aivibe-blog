<p class="has-text-align-none">Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/14/22933456/crypto-super-bowl-commercials-impact-advertisements-analysis-fomo">a few years ago</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606467/google-ai-super-bowl-ad-gouda-error-removed">fumbled a Gouda cheese stat</a>, and this year’s game is already slated to include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873685/anthropics-first-super-bowl-ad-dunks-on-chatgpt">an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform</a> that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/866775/ai-generated-ads-slop-human-creativity">AI-generated ads</a> could make an appearance, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Super Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.&nbsp;</p>
