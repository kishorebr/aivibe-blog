<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been all the rage around the Engadget HQ for the last few weeks. Even the editors who didn't write the official review have had their hands glued to their new toys. Of course, we've been testing other things too, mainly a repairable laptop that's design for student use. Read on to catch up on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/">reviews</a> you might've missed over the last two weeks.&nbsp;</p>

 <core-commerce id="30b4706d938247f7aeeb8ca67f8e06a2" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/15949610846?classType=REGULAR"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 finally made its way to gamers this month and several of us have been putting the portable console through its paces. Senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">wrote our full review</a>, noting that the company managed to take everything that make the original model so good and make it better. However, there's still room for improvement, especially with regards to battery life. "The Switch 2 has everything that made the original so great, but now there's more of it to enjoy," he said. "Granted, Nintendo's latest console commands a higher price, but as the successor to the iconic system that revived handheld gaming, this thing is worth it."</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h2> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="b4e90e79d8cb4a459abdb5bb971998be" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-black/6625904.p?skuId=6625904"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>A new Switch means a new Pro Controller, so senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-pro-controller-review-nintendos-best-gamepad-simply-costs-too-much-151330215.html">took a deep dive on Nintendo's new accessory</a>. Despite being "the most refined gampad" the company has ever made, he took offense to the price and the lack of advanced design features. "As much as I like the Switch 2 Pro Controller, it’s undoubtedly an extravagance at $85 when 8Bitdo’s Ultimate gamepad offers even more features for $50," he explained. "But if you’re a dedicated Nintendo fan, or you just can’t accept third-party controllers, it’s also one of the best gamepads you can buy today."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-framework-laptop-12">Framework Laptop 12</h2> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="ba976641b9274f35b194012ab94055c6" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://frame.work/products/laptop12-diy-intel-13gen/configuration/new"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The Framework Laptop 12 takes the company's familiar spin on modular, repairable machines and puts it in a smaller body with students in mind. However, the price is an issue and overall performance isn't good enough. "The limited performance and battery life here gives me pause and I’m not sure a machine that, right now, needs a stretch to run <em>Fortnite</em> would be too popular," <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/framework-laptop-12-review-doing-the-right-thing-comes-at-a-cost-150014067.html">senior reporter Dan Cooper wrote</a>. "My gut tells me Framework had intended to sell this for less before tariffs pushed the prices up beyond what made sense."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-a-playdate-season-2-update">A Playdate Season 2 update</h2> 
<p>Weekend editor Cheyenne Macdonald <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-long-puppy-and-ottos-galactic-groove-130025012.html">recently proclaimed</a> that there haven't been any flops at the halfway point of Playdate Season Two. The two newest additions are <em>Long Puppy</em> and <em>Otto's Galactic Groove!!, </em>two games that are fun but still offer a challenge.
