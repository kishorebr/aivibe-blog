<p>Here&#39;s a use of AI that appears to do more good than harm. A pair of astronomers at the European Space Agency (ESA) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esahubble.org/news/heic2603/?lang" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">developed</a> a neural network that searches through space images for anomalies. The results were far beyond what human experts could have done. In two and a half days, it sifted through nearly 100 million image cutouts, discovering 1,400 anomalous objects.</p><p>The creators of the AI model, David O&#39;Ryan and Pablo Gómez, call it AnomalyMatch. The pair trained it on (and applied it to) the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hla.stsci.edu/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>, which houses tens of thousands of datasets from Hubble&#39;s 35-year history. &quot;While trained scientists excel at spotting cosmic anomalies, there&#39;s simply too much Hubble data for experts to sort through at the necessary level of fine detail by hand,&quot; the ESA wrote in its press release.</p><p>After less than three days of scanning, AnomalyMatch returned a list of likely anomalies. It still requires human eyes at the end: Gómez and O&#39;Ryan reviewed the candidates to confirm which were truly abnormal. Among the 1,400 anomalous objects the pair confirmed, more than 800 were previously undocumented.</p><p>Most of the results showed galaxies merging or interacting, which can lead to odd shapes or long tails of stars and gas. Others were gravitational lenses. (That&#39;s where the gravity of a foreground galaxy bends spacetime so that the light from a background galaxy is warped into a circle or arc.) Other discoveries included planet-forming disks viewed edge-on, galaxies with huge clumps of stars and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_galaxy" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">jellyfish galaxies</a>. Adding a bit of mystery, there were even &quot;several dozen objects that defied classification altogether.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a fantastic use of AI to maximize the scientific output of the Hubble archive,&quot; Gómez is quoted as saying in the ESA&#39;s announcement. &quot;Finding so many anomalous objects in Hubble data, where you might expect many to have already been found, is a great result. It also shows how useful this tool will be for other large datasets.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/astronomers-discover-over-800-cosmic-anomalies-using-a-new-ai-tool-205135155.html?src=rss
