<p>Electronic Arts is close to reaching a $50 billion deal that will turn it into a privately held company, according to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ab30de23-fb9f-456e-8ce4-ed1ce8edab8e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlYWxzL2VhLXByaXZhdGUtZGVhbC1idXlvdXQtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1tYWtlci04MDhhZWZlYyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWIzMGRlMjMtZmI5Zi00NTZlLThjZTQtZWQxY2U4ZWRhYjhlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlYWxzL2VhLXByaXZhdGUtZGVhbC1idXlvdXQtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1tYWtlci04MDhhZWZlYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATkGxygXTDI-kus4guXqgSMOJs0wPxuh-sw3YnBtetGx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Fbusiness%2Fdeals%2Fea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The video game company filed for an IPO way back in 1990 and has been public ever since, but now a group of investors are in talks with the company to take it private. Those investors reportedly include private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia&#39;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner&#39;s Affinity Partners, whose largest source of funding is also Saudi&#39;s PIF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that EA&#39;s shares are already tied to major financial organizations, even though it&#39;s publicly traded, with Saudi&#39;s PIF <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/saudi-arabia-now-owns-10-of-electronic-arts/">owning almost 10 percent</a> of the company. As <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, analysts believe Saudi is interested in buying out EA due to its annual release of popular sports titles, including Madden and NHL, which makes for predictable earnings.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Saudi has made several major investments in the video gaming industry overall as part of its efforts to prepare for a post-oil economy. In addition to its investment in EA, it also purchased stakes in Take-Two Interactive, Activision Blizzard, Nintendo and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/embracer-group-is-splitting-up-its-messy-gaming-empire-into-three-different-companies-120006822.html">Embracer Group</a>. In March, <em>Pok√©mon Go</em> maker Niantic <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/pokemon-go-maker-niantic-sells-its-game-division-to-saudi-owned-scopely-160905447.html">sold its gaming division</a> to a Saudi-owned company, as well. Unlike PIF and Kushner&#39;s Affinity Partners, Silver Lake doesn&#39;t have a huge stake in EA at the moment and doesn&#39;t have notable gaming investments other than its stake in Unity.&nbsp;</p>

If the $50 billion deal does push through, it&#39;ll become the biggest leveraged buyout of all time.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-reportedly-plans-to-go-private-with-help-from-silver-lake-and-saudi-arabia-123011751.html?src=rss
