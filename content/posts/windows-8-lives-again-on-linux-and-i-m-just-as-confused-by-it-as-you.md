    Windows 8 lives again on Linux, and I'm just as confused by it as you
     
    This new project proves there's very little you can't do with Linux - even if you probably shouldn't.

I'm sure I can guess what you remember from that less-than-ideal iteration of Windows. The UI.Microsoft decided that a "card-based" interface was the way to go. At the time, they were also leveraging the Windows Phone, and when you compare them side-by-side, you start to understand why they went this route. Microsoft wanted to outdo Apple.Also: 8 free Linux apps that are surprisingly useful - no command line requiredWhether or not the Windows 8 UI was a success or failure is a matter of taste. I know people who hated it and people who loved it. As for me, I'm indifferent because I never had to use it.There's a Linux developer who either must have used it and misses it, or decided there were enough people out there to constitute an audience for a Linux UI that closely resembled Windows 8.The developer in question goes by er-bharat on GitHub, and his evil-scientist project is called Win8DE. Now, before I continue, I have to say that I spent roughly 2 hours trying to install Win8DE and had no luck. The reason behind this is the dependency issues. Of course, this is an alpha release of the software, so there will be issues, even with installation.Even so, you can check out the developer's GitHub page for the project and see just how close he's come to the Windows 8 desktop. Impressive.Do alternatives
