<p>Waymo's autonomous cars are heading back to New York City in July, the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Waymo/status/1935366905457517020">announced today</a>. Cars will be manually driven for now, not unlike the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">mapping tests</a> Waymo ran in 2021, but the company says it ultimately wants to bring the same autonomous ride-hailing service it offers in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles to NYC.</p>
<p>New York state law currently doesn't allow for the operation of a vehicle without a human driver, an obvious obstacle for a company like Waymo. As a bridge to offering its full service, Waymo says it's applied for a permit with the New York Department of Transportation to operate vehicles autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel. If NYC DOT approves the permit, the company says this will be the first "testing deployment" of autonomous vehicles in New York City.</p>

<p>Waymo's previous excursion in New York was focused on navigating city traffic and dealing with icy and snowy weather. Each city the company enters presents a new challenge, but the places Waymo currently operates are primarily in drier, warmer climates. For now, getting the state and city onboard with autonomous vehicles seems like the larger issue.</p>
<p>Outside of New York, Waymo continues to grow. The company recently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-expands-service-area-around-san-francisco-and-los-angeles-180811473.html">expanded its service area</a> around San Francisco and Los Angeles, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-ubers-austin-robotaxi-expansion-begins-today-120035908.html">came to Austin</a> with the help of Uber in March and plans to either offer paid rides or test its self-driving system in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-to-test-its-driverless-system-in-ten-new-cities-in-2025-193852446.html">several other cities</a> over the next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-will-start-testing-its-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-again-190530022.html?src=rss
