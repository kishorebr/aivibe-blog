<p>Huntr/x has indeed shown us how it&#39;s done-done-done. <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is now the queen it was meant to be, taking the crown as the most-watched title on Netflix. The charming animated film has racking up <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-most-watched-movie-history-1236496106/"><ins>236 million views</ins></a> since its debut on June 20.</p>
<p>The movie is about exactly what it says on the tin: a trio of k-pop idols secretly protect the human world from demons. But it became a smash hit this summer thanks to its unexpectedly insightful themes and unbelievably catchy soundtrack. In fact, the music is so good that the movie recently had <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/golden-billboard-hot-100-kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-1236497803/">four different tracks</a> in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the same time; no other movie soundtrack has done that before.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix even parlayed the popularity of <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> into a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-kpop-demon-hunters-is-headed-to-theaters-for-two-days-124552307.html"><ins>limited theatrical run</ins></a>, offering fans a chance to sing along with the film last weekend. Although the streaming service hasn&#39;t shared any figures from the theater singalong, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-kpop-demon-hunters-leads-box-office-over-weapons-1236497070/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> reported that based on other studios&#39; projections, Netflix made an estimated $18 to $20 million over the two days of showings.</p>
<p>The previous holder of most-watched on Netflix was heist flick Red Notice, which has generated <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><ins>231 million</ins></a> views since 2021. Considering <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> surpassed several years&#39; worth of views in a matter of months, that&#39;s one heck of a takedown.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/kpop-demon-hunters-is-netflixs-most-watched-movie-of-all-time-215857627.html?src=rss
