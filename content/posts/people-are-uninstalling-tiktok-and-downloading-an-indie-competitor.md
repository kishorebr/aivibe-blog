<p>TikTok's newly formed US entity is off to a very bumpy start. As the app continues to face technical issues affecting the recommendation algorithm, view counts and other features, TikTok is also seeing a wave of frustrated users uninstalling it, according to new data.</p><p>Analytics firm Sensor Tower, which tracks downloads and other app store-related metrics, told <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-uninstalls-are-up-150percent-following-us-joint-venture.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;slk:CNBC;cpos:1;pos:1">CNBC</a> that there has been a 150 percent rise in uninstalls of the TikTok app in the United States compared with the last three months. An analyst at Sensor Tower told Engadget that TikTok's US daily active users (DAUs) have increased about 2 percent in the same time period, and are flat week-over-week. TikTok has blamed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-says-a-power-outage-is-causing-issues-with-the-app-in-the-us-173426617.html" data-i13n="slk:a power outage;cpos:2;pos:1">a power outage</a> at a data center for “multiple bugs,”  including those affecting view counts and load times. The company hasn't said when users can expect a fix.</p><p>At the same time, an independent app called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://upscrolled.com/en/" data-i13n="slk:UpScrolled;cpos:3;pos:1">UpScrolled</a> has seen a surge in interest over the last few days. The app is currently the ninth most-downloaded app in the US App Store and the second most popular social app (Meta's Threads is currently in the number one spot for social apps). The app has also reached the top five in the UK and Australian app stores. In the United States, its sudden popularity seems to be closely tied to recent changes at TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>UpScrolled has seen 41,000 total downloads between Thursday (the day the US joint venture was formalized) and Saturday, according to estimates from App Figures. The app, which was first released last June, has been downloaded about 140,000 times between Apple and Google's app stores, according to App Figures. Prior to last Thursday, the app was averaging less than 500 downloads a day, according to the company. The rapid increase in downloads has apparently caused some issues for the company which asked users to "bear with us" on Monday.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, this is new...<br>You showed up so fast our servers tapped out. Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes.<br>We're a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we're scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started.<br>Bear with us. We're on it. <a href="https://t.co/OAlYcN6t5q">pic.twitter.com/OAlYcN6t5q</a></p>— UpScrolled (@realUpScrolled) <a href="https://twitter.com/realUpScrolled/status/2015797730241601808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote></div><p>Created by an Australian developer, UpScrolled looks a bit like Instagram. Users can share photos and shortform videos. The app defaults to a chronological "following" feed, though it does also recommend content to users. The app is "privately funded by its founder, Issam Hijazi, together with a small group of individual investors who share our mission and values," according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://upscrolled.com/en/faq/" data-i13n="slk:an FAQ;cpos:4;pos:1">an FAQ</a> on UpScrolled's website. It currently has no ads, though the company says it "probably" will in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the first time turmoil at TikTok has benefitted a previously little-known app. Chinese app RedNote briefly became <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/chinese-social-media-app-rednote-is-the-number-one-app-as-tiktok-ban-looms-235929802.html" data-i13n="slk:the top app;cpos:5;pos:1">the top app</a> in the United States early last year as TikTok faced a potential ban. RedNote's popularity proved to be short-lived, though, as the 2025 TikTok "ban" ended up lasting only a couple of hours.&nbsp;</p><p>But with new owners at TikTok and growing frustration over technical issues with the app, there could be an opportunity for a new shortform video service that's not controlled by a huge corporation. And that's what UpScrolled seems to be betting on. "Too often, users are left uncertain about whether their voices will be heard or quietly suppressed," the company writes on its website. "UpScrolled changes that by ensuring every post has a fair chance to be seen, creating an environment that is authentic, unfiltered, and equitable for all."</p><p><strong>Update, January 26, 2026, 4:28PM PT: </strong>This post was updated to reflect the latest details from TikTok about the ongoing issues affecting the US version of the app.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/people-are-uninstalling-tiktok-and-downloading-an-indie-competitor-233345222.html?src=rss
