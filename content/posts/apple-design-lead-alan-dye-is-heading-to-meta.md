<p>Alan Dye, Apple's Vice President of Human Interface Design, has been poached by Meta, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. The designer played a pivotal role in the look and feel of Apple's products since Jony Ive <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-jony-ive-lovefrom.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">left the company in 2019</a>, and now he’ll be taking his talents to Meta.</p><p>Dye will reportedly work under Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth as the head of a new studio that will oversee the design of hardware, software and AI products. The studio will also include former Apple designer Billy Sorrentino, Meta’s interface design lead Joshua To, an industrial design team led by Pete Bristol, and metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP?xmt=AQF0br27Jz8KJgqC5jkEdjV3nvOGsokta6g3eNEAeT_P1Q" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">announced on Threads</a>. </p><p>“The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences,” Zuckerberg shared in the post. “Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable and human-centered.”</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, is replacing Dye with Stephen Lemay, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports, a senior designer at the company who's worked on all of the company’s interfaces since 1999. Considering the secrecy of Apple as a company, it's hard to credit individual breakthroughs to individual designers, but Dye worked on several of Apple's major new platforms and design changes, including things like the interface of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-realityos-ar-vr-headset-operating-system-wwdc-2023-185901735.html" data-i13n="slk:visionOS;cpos:4;pos:1">visionOS</a> and its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html" data-i13n="slk:Liquid Glass;cpos:5;pos:1">Liquid Glass</a> design language.</p><p>Meta has had success with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-3-becomes-most-used-vr-headset-on-steam-unseating-quest-2/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Quest virtual reality headsets</a> and more recently, its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fc65353f-45dc-4cd0-89be-ac2071680abb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9de78ef4-b7c4-498a-a3c8-5004d6ab20d1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=WIRED&amp;linkText=Ray-Ban+Meta+smart+glasses&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbWV0YS1oYXMtYWxyZWFkeS13b24tdGhlLXNtYXJ0LWdsYXNzZXMtcmFjZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlkZTc4ZWY0LWI3YzQtNDk4YS1hM2M4LTUwMDRkNmFiMjBkMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lyZWQuY29tL3N0b3J5L21ldGEtaGFzLWFscmVhZHktd29uLXRoZS1zbWFydC1nbGFzc2VzLXJhY2UvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd4cF6ddNAxz8zIrYHByvbfX_q4z8V5anJnoCqMxTFz_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fmeta-has-already-won-the-smart-glasses-race%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:WIRED;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-has-already-won-the-smart-glasses-race/">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, but the company clearly hopes to release many more consumer hardware products with Dye and its new design studio’s help. Those will likely include future versions of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> and its Neural Band accessory.</p><p>Dye isn't the first designer Apple has lost to a competitor.

Dye joining Meta is particularly interesting in this case because Apple is rumored to be working on products that will bring the company in even closer competition to the social media giant. The Vision Pro could be considered to be a high-end competitor in VR, but Apple is reportedly working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-is-reportedly-pulling-staff-from-the-vision-pro-to-work-on-its-smart-glasses-130050475.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">its own pair of smart glasses</a>, too.<br><br><strong>Update, December 3, 5:54PM ET:</strong> Added information from Mark Zuckerberg’s Threads post on hiring Alan Dye and Meta’s new design studio.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-design-lead-alan-dye-is-heading-to-meta-214449944.html?src=rss
