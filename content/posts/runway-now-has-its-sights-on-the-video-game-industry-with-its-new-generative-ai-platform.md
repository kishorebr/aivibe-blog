<p>The AI startup Runway, which recently partnered with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amc-networks-is-teaming-up-with-ai-company-runway-141959898.html">AMC Networks</a>, is now trying to break into the gaming industry. The company has plans to launch its latest platform, called Game Worlds, next week, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate"><em>The Verge</em></a>. The new tool lets Runway users create something akin to an interactive text-based game that can generate text and images from AI.</p>
<p>Even though Game Worlds can only <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePulNCRDvz8">produce basic designs</a> for now, the company's CEO, Crist√≥bal Valenzuela, is hoping this will be the first step towards more AI use in the gaming industry. Valenzuela told <em>The Verge</em> that "generated video games are coming later this year," adding that Runway is looking to partner with video game companies, which will be able to use the company's AI tools, while it gets access to video game datasets to train its AI on. However, the use of AI in video games has already drawn a lot of criticism from industry professionals, even leading to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/video-game-performers-will-strike-over-ai-concerns-201733660.html">SAG-AFTRA union</a> striking against video game companies using its members' likenesses and voices to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/video-game-performers-will-strike-over-ai-concerns-201733660.html">train AI</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Runway has faced its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-video-startup-runway-reportedly-trained-on-thousands-of-youtube-videos-without-permission-182314160.html">own controversy</a> for reportedly training its AI on YouTube videos and pirated movies despite being against the video platform's terms. Still, Runway is looking to replicate the similar success it's had with major TV and film studios. In the AMC deal, the AI company would help create promotional materials and help "accelerate pre-visualization during development." Before AMC, Runway secured a partnership with Lionsgate to provide its AI for the studio's "pre-production and post-production process." As for the gaming world, Runway wouldn't be the first to introduce generative AI since the industry has seen other examples already, like Ubisoft using a tool called <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-ghostwriter-ai-tool--automatically-generate-video-game-dialogue-103510366.html">Ghostwriter</a> to create video game dialogue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/runway-now-has-its-sights-on-the-video-game-industry-with-its-new-generative-ai-platform-192350294.html?src=rss
