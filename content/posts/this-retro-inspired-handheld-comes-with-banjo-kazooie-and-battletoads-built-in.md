<p>Who would&#39;ve guessed we&#39;d get to play the original <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> on a handheld with just a D-pad in 2026. HyperMegaTech!&#39;s latest release is a collaboration with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-confirms-hes-left-rare-220828667.html">Rare Ltd.</a>, the legendary game developer known for the Banjo-Kazooie franchise and, more recently, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-sea-of-thieves-steam.html"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, called the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://evercade.co.uk/press-release/press-release-rare-super-pocket-from-hypermegatech-coming-june-2026/">Super Pocket Rare Edition</a>.</p>

<p>The vertical handheld features 14 classics from the British developer, including two Battletoads titles, <em>Conker&#39;s Pocket Tales</em> and many more. While most of the games were released on 8- or 16-bit consoles, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> will be the headliner since it was originally released on the Nintendo 64. It may sound weird to control Banjo and Kazooie with a D-pad, but HyperMegaTech! assured that the game has been enhanced and optimized specifically for the Super Pocket handheld.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since HyperMegaTech! and Evercade share Blaze Entertainment as a parent company, that means the Rare Edition handheld will be compatible with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/evercade-retro-handheld-hands-on-133010341-133010505.html">Evercade cartridges</a>. Once you&#39;re done with the 14 included games, you can expand your Super Pocket&#39;s library with cartridges that feature collections from Taito, NeoGeo or Atari. HyperMegaTech! said the Rare Edition handheld will be available for $69.99 in June 2026, but has already opened <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/rare-edition/">preorders</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-retro-inspired-handheld-comes-with-banjo-kazooie-and-battletoads-built-in-203111135.html?src=rss
