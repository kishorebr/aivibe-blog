<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft AI just announced its first text-to-image generator, <a href="https://microsoft.ai/news/introducing-mai-image-1-debuting-in-the-top-10-on-lmarena/">MAI-Image-1</a>, designed and developed in-house. The tech giant, which recently announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/776853/microsoft-ai-training-capacity-investments-in-house-models">first in-house Microsoft AI models</a>, called the new image generator “the next step on our journey.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft says it sought feedback from creative professionals in order to avoid “repetitive or generically-stylized outputs.” MAI-Image-1 “excels” at photorealistic imagery like lightning, landscapes, and more, the company claims. And it can process requests and produce images faster than “larger, slower models.” The model has already secured a spot in the top 10 of LMArena, the AI benchmark site where humans compare outputs from different systems and vote on the best one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">MAI-Image-1 joins <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767809/microsoft-in-house-ai-models-launch-openai">Microsoft’s other AI products</a>, voice generator MAI-Voice-1 AI and chatbot MAI-1-preview. The company was an early funder of OpenAI, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/688964/microsoft-openai-relationship-notepad">the two companies’ relationship has grown increasingly complicated</a>. Microsoft has also started to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784392/microsoft-365-copilot-anthropic-ai-models-feature">use Anthropic’s AI models</a> for some features in Microsoft 365 recently, and is making “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/776853/microsoft-ai-training-capacity-investments-in-house-models">significant investments</a>” in training its own AI models like MAI-Image-1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We haven’t had a chance to test Microsoft’s new image generator, but once we have we’ll report back on its safety guardrails. The company says it’s committed to “ensuring safe and responsible outcomes.”</p>
