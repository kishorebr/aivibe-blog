<p>One of the things that&#39;s long irked me about Meta&#39;s smart glasses is how often you have to say &quot;hey Meta.&quot; Even though the company&#39;s AI assistant has gotten significantly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">more capable</a>, there&#39;s something a little cringey about using its voice commands in public spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the company has rolled out an update that makes you a little less dependent on voice commands for all its glasses. A new &quot;quick connect&quot; feature allows you to create a one-touch shortcut for &quot;frequently used communication actions,&quot; like making a phone call or sending a text to a specific contact. The update is out now as part of the 19.2 software update.</p><p>The idea of &quot;quick connect&quot; is similar to the functionality of the &quot;action button&quot; on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> glasses, though it&#39;s more limited in scope. The feature allows you to designate a specific contact that you can message, text or call just by holding down on the touchpad on the right side of the glasses. The Meta AI app will even let you choose your preferred method of reaching them, whether it&#39;s WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger or your phone&#39;s native calling or messaging app. The same one-touch press and hold shortcut can also be used to send photos and videos shot on the glasses right after you take them (also via your chosen app).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-06_at_13.02.45.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-06_at_13.02.45.png" style="height:1896px;width:1179px;" alt="You can designate a specific contact and on which app you want to be able to contact them." data-uuid="2269632a-7bdb-4f8d-938f-c0b27c7ebd81"><figcaption>You can designate a specific contact and on which app you want to be able to contact them.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>During its Connect event, Meta previewed some updates for third-party apps that appear to allow developers to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">set their own</a> wake words for the glasses when using their services. So there is some hope that eventually the company will offer a bit more flexibility with its voice commands. Even so, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to get away with never having to say &quot;hey Meta,&quot; but the quick connect update is a handy way to make messaging a bit more discreet. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-smart-glasses-have-a-new-shortcut-to-call-and-text-without-saying-hey-meta-213303178.html?src=rss
