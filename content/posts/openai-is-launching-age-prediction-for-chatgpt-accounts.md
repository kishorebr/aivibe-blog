<p>OpenAI is the latest company to hop on the bandwagon of gating access by users&#39; age. The AI business is beginning a global rollout of an age prediction tool to determine whether or not a user is a minor. “The model looks at a combination of behavioral and account-level signals, including how long an account has existed, typical times of day when someone is active, usage patterns over time,and a user’s stated age,” the company’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-age-prediction/" data-i13n="slk:announcement;cpos:1;pos:1">announcement</a> states. If an individual is incorrectly characterized by ChatGPT as underage, they will need to submit a selfie to correct the mistake through the Persona age verification platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Most AI companies have been willing to push new features first and then attempt to layer on a patchwork of protections and safety guards on top of them after they cause harm. OpenAI was implicated in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">wrongful death suit</a> for a teen who allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his suicide, and only in the following months began pondering <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/following-teen-suicide-openai-explores-automatic-underage-user-restrictions-151948711.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">automatic restrictions</a> on content for underage users and launching a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-forms-advisory-council-on-wellbeing-and-ai-183815365.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">mental health advisory council</a>. In this instance, OpenAI is attempting to prepare for the launch of an &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">adult mode</a>&quot; that will allow users to create and consume content that would be dubbed NSFW. Considering how well <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/robloxs-age-verification-system-is-reportedly-a-trainwreck-220320016.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a similar change</a> has been going over at Roblox, another platform with a shaky history around protecting minors, it seems probable that underage users will find ways to circumvent the existing tools if they want to use ChatGPT as adults.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-launching-age-prediction-for-chatgpt-accounts-222650340.html?src=rss
