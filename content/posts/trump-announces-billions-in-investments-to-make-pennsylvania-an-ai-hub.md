<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump announced more than $90 billion in investments from private companies that they said are tied to AI, tech, and energy during the “inaugural” Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit on Tuesday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pennsylvania is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=PA">a leading gas-producing state</a> and an <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/fracking-pennsylvania-shale-gas-workforce-health-environmental-damage/">epicenter of the </a><span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/fracking-pennsylvania-shale-gas-workforce-health-environmental-damage/" target="_blank">US fracking boom</a>; some</span> of the largest investments linked to the initiative were from energy companies, including “a $25 billion investment in data center and energy infrastructure development in Northeast Pennsylvania” from Blackstone, and $15 billion in expansions announced by First Energy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump repeated calls to &#8220;drill, baby, drill&#8221; during the event, and some gas companies were included on <a href="https://www.mccormick.senate.gov/press-releases/fact-sheet-more-than-90-billion-in-investments-announced-at-senator-mccormicks-pennsylvania-energy-and-innovation-summit/">a fact sheet</a> from Senator Dave McCormick listing the announcements.  Enbridge plans to invest $1 billion to expand its gas pipelines “into Pennsylvania,” Equinor is investing $1.6 billion to “boost natural gas production at Equinor’s Pennsylvania facilities and explore opportunities to link gas to flexible power generation for data centers,” and Capital Power said it’s spending $3 billion over 10 years on an upgraded gas facility in the state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google&#8217;s president and chief investment officer, Ruth Porat, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/pennsylvania-energy-innovation-summit/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nfg&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=">announced </a>that the company plans to invest $25 billion to build data centers and AI infrastructure over the next two years across the <a href="https://www.pjm.com/about-pjm/who-we-are/territory-served">PJM region</a>, which includes 13 states and Washington, D.C., along with a 20-year, $3 billion US hydropower deal with Brookfield Energy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cloud computing company CoreWeave <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250715975958/en/CoreWeave-Announces-Multi-Billion-Dollar-Commitment-to-AI-Infrastructure-in-Pennsylvania">announced plans</a> to invest $6 billion in a data center “to power the most cutting-edge AI use cases” in Pennsylvania. Anthropic will commit $1 million over three years to support a program that provides cybersecurity education and an additional $1 million over three years to “support energy research at Carnegie Mellon University.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta announced a $2.5 million partnership to “support startups in rural Pennsylvania communities in addition to community accelerator training for small businesses,” while AWS CEO Matt Garman <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-aws-trump-summit-ai-energy-future">was also at the event</a>, with Amazon pointing toward <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-pennsylvania-investment-cloud-infrastructure-ai-innovation">previously announced</a> “plans to invest $20 billion in Pennsylvania to expand cloud computing infrastructure and advance AI innovation.”</p>
