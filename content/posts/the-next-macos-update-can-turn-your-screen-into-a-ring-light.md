<p>Sometimes, the best features in a new operating system aren&#39;t the flashy ones that get broadcast during a keynote. They&#39;re subtle improvements that naturally fit into how you use your device and just make the experience better. One of those appears to be coming in the next macOS update. The dev beta of Tahoe 26.2 includes a feature that essentially lets your computer screen function as a ring light during a video call.</p><p>It&#39;s called Edge Light and it illuminates a rectangular band around the edge of the screen. Apple&#39;s Neural Engine will also position the light based on where it detects your face in the video frame. There are some controls for making the light warmer or cooler, and it can be set to turn on automatically once the brightness in your environment dims. Edge Light doesn&#39;t cover the top menu bar, and it will also move out of the way if the cursor hovers over it so that you can still use your laptop normally while on a call.&nbsp;</p><p>Edge Light will only be available on MacBooks from after 2024 that are running on Apple&#39;s Silicon. It may not be a true replacement for a ring light, but it&#39;s probably a step up from opening a bunch of blank Google Docs to try and illuminate yourself for a last-minute meeting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-next-macos-update-can-turn-your-screen-into-a-ring-light-234410504.html?src=rss
