<p>The Hitman trilogy, also known as <em>Hitman World of Assassination,</em> will be available on iPhones, iPads, as well as Mac computers, this summer. IO Interactive has announced that it was expanding Hitman&#39;s availability during the developer&#39;s showcase at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-schedule-announcements-new-games-and-everything-else-to-expect-183538568.html">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, where it celebrated the franchise&#39;s 25th anniversary. IO Interactive&#39;s Chief Development Officer, Veronique Lallier, said the launch on iOS means you can travel the world with Hitman in your pocket. Event attendees were given the chance to experience the game running natively on iOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lallier also announced that Hitman is coming to table top. IO Interactive has teamed up with board game creator Mood Publishing to make <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moodpublishing/hitman-the-board-game">Hitman the board game</a>, which will be available for backing on Kickstarter later this year. The board game will feature the franchise&#39;s characters, iconic weapons and backdrops. Up to four players can play as assassins going after a single target, and the one who takes the target out will get the payout in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the developer has revealed that Le Chiffre, the villain from the Bond film <em>Casino Royale</em>, will be the World of Assassination&#39;s new Elusive Target. Mads Mikkelsen, the actor who played Le Chiffre in the movie, provided the likeness and the voice for the new game character. You&#39;ll only have a limited time to go after Mikkelsen&#39;s character, as Hitman&#39;s Elusive Target missions only appear once, and you cannot attempt them again after they end. To note, IO Interactive recently revealed its James Bond game, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-james-bond-game-007-first-light-is-coming-in-2026-215517819.html"><em>007 First Light</em></a>, which will be coming out in 2026. If you play the Elusive Target mission with Le Chiffre, you can redeem an exclusive suit in <em>007 First Light</em> when it becomes available.</p>
