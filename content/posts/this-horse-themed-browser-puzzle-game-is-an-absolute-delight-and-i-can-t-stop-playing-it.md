<p>Another day, another adorable game that I&#39;ve become completely obsessed with. I came across <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://miaumigames.itch.io/roly-pony"><em>Roly-Pony</em></a> this weekend during a particularly soul-sucking bout of doomscrolling, and it&#39;s turned out to be the perfect little temporary respite from <em>the horrors</em>. (Shoutout to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social/post/3lymxnpo5ps2g">Alice Ruppert</a> of <em>The Mane Quest</em> for always keeping us informed about the latest in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-developers-are-trying-to-make-horse-games-that-dont-suck-its-not-easy-140008337.html">horse games</a>).</p>
<p><em>Roly-Pony</em> is a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://youtu.be/eh_xSyPsEVI?t=191"><em>Suika</em></a>-style game, meaning it involves dropping and stacking round objects in order to create matching pairs that combine to become different, bigger objects. That&#39;ll also clear up space on the board in the process, which is important because, similar to <em>Tetris</em>, you can&#39;t allow the objects to pile too high. In this case, you start with horse treats and keep building on them until you&#39;ve unlocked a bunch of different horses. It&#39;s very simple and <em>very</em> cute, with peaceful music going in the background and a lot of little details that people who love horses will really appreciate.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game is free and playable on both the web and mobile, with a leaderboard so you can see how you rank. I naively thought I would just quickly check this game out (because, horses) and move on after a few minutes, but have instead spent <em>hours</em> this weekend trying to crack the top 10. I&#39;ve now got it bookmarked on both my laptop and my phone, so at this point there&#39;s no end in sight. <em>Roly-Pony</em> is free, but there&#39;s an option to send a few dollars the developers&#39; way on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> if you want to support their work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-horse-themed-browser-puzzle-game-is-an-absolute-delight-and-i-cant-stop-playing-it-214313395.html?src=rss
