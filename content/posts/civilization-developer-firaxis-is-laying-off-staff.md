<p>Firaxis, longtime developer of the strategy series Civilization, is laying off an undisclosed number of staff, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis"><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em><ins> reports</ins></a>. The studio&#39;s publisher and owner 2K confirmed that the layoffs were happening as Firaxis &quot;restructures and optimizes&quot; for &quot;adaptability, collaboration, and creativity.&quot; The layoffs follow <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bioshock-4-hits-a-major-development-snag-and-a-remake-of-the-original-gets-put-on-ice-182523192.html"><ins>turmoil at another 2K studio</ins></a>, Cloud Chamber, which is supposed to be developing the next Bioshock game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the restructuring has yet to be publicly disclosed, it&#39;s hard to say with absolute certainty how many people have been impacted. Some former staff who <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/emmakidwell.bsky.social/post/3lxzgvwuq6k2r"><ins>worked on</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lightningfused.bsky.social/post/3lxzhoahbfc2h"><em><ins>Civilization VII</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminreeves.bsky.social/post/3lxzunia7w52b"><ins>and </ins><em><ins>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Sons</ins></em></a> have already shared that they were laid off social media. <em>Game Developer&#39;</em>s<em>&nbsp;</em>source claims &quot;dozens of workers&quot; were caught up in the cuts.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget has contacted 2K for details about the layoffs and will update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>The layoffs are surprising only because Take-Two Interactive, Firaxis and 2K&#39;s parent company, was still expecting financial growth for the back half of 2025. Despite delaying its hotly anticipated cash cow <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, Take-Two shared in March that it expected five percent growth in revenue and net bookings for the rest of the year, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-projects-annual-growth-despite-gta-vi-delay"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em></a>. While that might suggest jobs should be safe, layoffs are increasingly a feature of game companies&#39; normal business strategies. A game could be a failure or a success, but either way it seems to lead to layoffs.</p>
<p>Firaxis&#39; latest game, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/prepare-for-world-domination-when-civilization-vii-arrives-in-february-2025-213051202.html"><em><ins>Civilization VII</ins></em></a>, was released in February 2025. The game features a new approach to the series&#39; turn-based gameplay, letting players mix and match world leaders and civilizations to their strategic benefit. While it wasn&#39;t released to universal acclaim, Firaxis has continued to update <em>Civilization VII </em>since its release with new content and software fixes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/civilization-developer-firaxis-is-laying-off-staff-221105604.html?src=rss
