<p>Apple isn&#39;t ready to pay a several billion-dollar fine to UK App Store users and is filing an appeal over a major antitrust lawsuit. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/26/apple-seeks-to-appeal-15bn-ruling-it-overcharged-uk-customers"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Apple has requested to appeal to the UK&#39;s Court of Appeal, which would escalate the case beyond the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest appeal attempt follows an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-loses-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-over-app-store-fees-184515613.html">October decision</a> from the CAT, where the court found that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by exploiting its dominant market position with the App Store to charge higher fees. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2025-12/14037721%20Dr.%20Rachael%20Kent%20v%20Apple%20Inc.%20and%20Apple%20Distribution%20International%20Ltd%20-%20%20Judgment%20%5B2025%5D%20CAT%2067%2023%20Oct%202025.pdf">CAT&#39;s ruling</a> established a £1.5 billion, or roughly $2 billion, fine, but Apple said it planned to appeal and that the court &quot;takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy.&quot; The CAT didn&#39;t grant Apple the appeal, leading the iPhone maker to seek a higher court to overturn the ruling.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple hasn&#39;t made any official statements about its latest appeal application, but it&#39;s likely that it will argue against the CAT&#39;s proposed App Store developer fee rate of between 15 and 20 percent, which it reached through &quot;informed guesswork,&quot; instead of the existing 30 percent. If the fine does ultimately stick, the $2 billion fine would be split amongst any App Store user in the UK who made purchases between 2015 and 2024, according to <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-escalates-its-appeal-of-a-2-billion-fine-from-a-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-201922558.html?src=rss
