<p>The case revolves around whether Apple violated Masimo&#39;s patent related to blood-oxygen sensors, which the jury claimed can be seen with the Apple Watch&#39;s Workout and Heart Rate apps. According to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple disagreed with the verdict, adding that &quot;the single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago.&quot; The tech giant is reportedly planning to appeal the decision.&nbsp;</p>
