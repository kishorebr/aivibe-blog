<p>Following her son&#39;s suicide, Becca Dallas filed a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit against <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-adding-an-age-estimation-feature-for-teens-110047092.html">Roblox</a> and Discord, accusing the platforms of wrongful death. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/technology/roblox-lawsuit-child-safety.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the lawsuit recounts the events leading up to Ethan Dallas&#39; death, detailing his interactions with a player named Nate. According to the report, Nate was likely a 37-year-old man named Timothy O&#39;Connor, who was previously arrested on charges of &quot;possessing child pornography and transmitting harmful material to minors.&quot; The report added that Ethan opened up about these incidents to his mom before committing suicide four months after the confession.</p>
<p>The lawsuit could be the first of its kind against Roblox, according to <em>NYTimes</em>, considering it attributes some blame to the gaming platform that&#39;s home to tens of millions of underaged players. In a statement responding to the report, a Roblox spokesperson said that child safety issues are seen across the industry and that the company was working on new safety features, while also complying with law enforcement.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Roblox has faced complaints of being a dangerous place for underage players. In August, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html">Louisiana&#39;s attorney general</a>, Liz Murrill, filed a lawsuit that claimed Roblox doesn&#39;t &quot;implement basic safety controls&quot; to protect its underage user base. That lawsuit follows a similar investigation launched by Florida&#39;s attorney general <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child">James Uthmeier</a>, who demanded answers to the reports of Roblox reportedly exposing kids to &quot;harmful content and bad actors.&quot; Roblox has taken steps to combat these allegations, including tightening restrictions on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/roblox-cracks-down-on-its-user-created-content-following-multiple-child-safety-lawsuits-193452150.html">Experiences</a>, and more recently, expanding its age estimation tool to all users.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-hit-with-wrongful-death-lawsuit-following-a-teen-players-suicide-201501296.html?src=rss
