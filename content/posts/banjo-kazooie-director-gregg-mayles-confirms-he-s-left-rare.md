<p>Gregg Mayles, the director of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and designer on <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, has announced that he&#39;s left Rare. News of Mayles&#39; exit <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"><ins>was first reported</ins></a> in July 2025 during a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html"><ins>rash of layoffs and game cancellations</ins></a> across Xbox Games Studios, but the short poem he <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778"><ins>shared on X</ins></a> today makes it official.</p>
<p>With a 36-year tenure at the studio, Mayles saw its transition from an exclusive Nintendo partner to a Microsoft subsidiary. He helped design games like <em>Battletoads,</em> created Banjo-Kazooie and when studio founders Tim and Chris Stamper left in 2007, stepped up and became Rare&#39;s creative director. Mayles also led the team behind <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, one of Rare&#39;s modern successes.</p>

Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>â€” Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>The studio has been supporting <em>Sea of Thieves</em> with new content since it was released in 2018, but was also working on a new project, <em>Everwild</em>, that was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-rare-everwild-xbox.html"><ins>announced in 2019</ins></a>. The game went through a troubled development process over the last few years, and Rare <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/why-wasnt-everwild-at-e3-its-been-completely-rebooted/"><ins>reportedly started from scratch in 2021</ins></a> with Mayles taking over as director. Microsoft&#39;s decision to cancel the game and layoff staff at the studio this summer is likely one of the reasons he left.</p>
<p>Losing Mayles is just one example of Microsoft&#39;s self-inflicted wounds from 2025. The company not only made cuts at <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html"><ins>Halo Studios</ins></a> and Forza Motorsport developer <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side"><ins>Turn 10</ins></a>, it also increased the prices of both <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">Xbox consoles</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">Game Pass Ultimate</a>.  All of these changes are seemingly in service of shifting the Xbox business into something that&#39;s more focused on subscriptions and game publishing, but the transition definitely seems like a painful one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-confirms-hes-left-rare-220828667.html?src=rss
