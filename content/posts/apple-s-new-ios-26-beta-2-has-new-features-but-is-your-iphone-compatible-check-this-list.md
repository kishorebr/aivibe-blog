<p>The wait for accessing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 is getting shorter as the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html">Apple iPhone event</a> inches closer. The OS 26es are bringing <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-and-ipados-26-public-beta-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-apple-updates-135749093.html">huge upgrades</a> to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. One you've probably heard us talk about numerous times is the visual update: <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Liquid Glass</a>. (It's like the better-executed version of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Windows Vista</a>.) We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">hands-on iOS 26 preview</a>, or you can try it out yourself by <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html">downloading and installing the public beta 2</a>. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">beta 7 </a>waypoint, and offers a few more <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/">flashy features</a> not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html">new live translation feature to AirPods</a>, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.</p>
<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html">everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event</a>. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">Apple's updated version of Siri</a>, though the company is reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to compete with ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-if-i-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-iphone">What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</h2>
<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-when-will-ios-26-become-available">When will iOS 26 become available?</h2>
<p>Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.&nbsp;</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-beta-2-has-new-features-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854362.html?src=rss
