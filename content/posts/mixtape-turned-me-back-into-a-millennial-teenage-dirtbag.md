<p><em>Mixtape</em> is the answer to the question, “What if the movie <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA9gPtWDiww"><em>High Fidelity</em></a> was a video game?” It’s not a perfect analogy, but it’s pretty damn close, and either way it’s a sign that <em>Mixtape</em> is going to be a fabulous slice of late-1990s, early-2000s nostalgia, complete with a banging soundtrack.</p>
<p>You can hear it in the trailers — <em>Mixtape </em>absolutely nails the classic Moviefone tone, and it seems that this vibe extends to the full game. I played roughly 30 minutes of <em>Mixtape</em> at Summer Game Fest 2025, and in that time I became enamored with the game’s lead character, a rebellious and insufferably cool teenager named Rockford who’s about to leave suburbia to pursue her dreams of becoming a music supervisor in New York City. She talks directly to the player as she introduces her two also-very-cool best friends and cues up the game’s music, breaking the fourth wall just like John Cusack. Most of the game plays out in a third-person view, following along as Rockford and her friends casually skate down tree-lined streets, flee from the cops in a high-speed shopping-cart sequence, and hang out in her bedroom, looking at Polaroid pictures and CDs while planning the best way to steal liquor from her parents’ stash.</p>

<p><em>Mixtape</em> comes from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/jason-schwartzman-artful-escape-release-date-xbox-pc-190522944.html"><em>The Artful Escape</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>studio Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, and it similarly uses music as a core storytelling and scene-setting device. This makes perfect sense, considering the studio’s founder, Johnny Galvatron, is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-29-artful-escape-rockstar-video-game-bowie-galvatron.html">a legit rock star</a> based in Melbourne, Australia. Leaning into musicality also worked out well for <em>The Artful Escape</em>, which<em>&nbsp;</em>earned Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur a BAFTA award in 2022. <em>Mixtape</em>’s soundtrack is populated by the top teenage-dirtbag bands from the 80s, 90s and slightly beyond, including DEVO, Roxy Music, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division and the Cure (but not Wheatus, as far as I can tell, just to be clear).</p>
<p>Visually, <em>Mixtape </em>has a painterly 3D aesthetic with gorgeous golden light and purple shadows, reminiscent of <em>Life is Strange</em> or Telltale’s The Walking Dead series. In action, the characters move in a windswept, <em>Spider-Verse</em> animation style that doesn’t interrupt the gameplay flow. Even soaring down the snakelike asphalt on a skateboard, Rockford responds immediately to controller input and her ride isn’t interrupted by stray or late animations. <em>Mixtape</em> looks lovely and feels great.</p>

<p>There are also surprising little moments with alternative mechanics in the game’s first half hour, including a scene straight out of <em>Wayne’s World</em> where you make the trio headbang in a car, and another where you control two tongues making out in a close-up, <em>Ren &amp; Stimpy</em> kind of cartoon realism. When Rockford explains what a music supervisor is, real-world reference images fill the screen in a tongue-in-cheek educational interlude. Throughout all of this, the music continues to roll, each song purposefully placed and given time to shine.</p>
<p>It would be easy for <em>Mixtape</em> to feel like a cheap nostalgia grab, an exploitation of Millennial players’ memories of skipping CDs and pre-cellphone party planning, but that simply isn’t the case so far. <em>Mixtape </em>feels like a love letter to the early aughts, filled with surprising mechanics, beautiful graphics and all the right references executed extremely well.</p>
<p><em>Mixtape</em> is due to hit <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582320/Mixtape/">Steam</a>, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025, published by Annapurna Interactive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mixtape-turned-me-back-into-a-millennial-teenage-dirtbag-200337301.html?src=rss
