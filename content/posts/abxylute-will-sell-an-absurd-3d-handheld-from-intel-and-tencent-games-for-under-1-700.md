<p>As the handheld PC boom has taken off, companies have tried to push the boundaries of the Steam Deck form factor Valve helped popularize. Lenovo <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-go-review-the-xl-alternative-to-the-steam-deck-141522230.html">tried detachable controllers</a>. Acer is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-acer-nitro-blaze-11-is-an-absolutely-massive-handheld-gaming-pc-194505881.html">trying an 11-inch screen</a>. And Abxylute is apparently combining them both (and then some) into the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">Abxylute 3D One</a>, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/abxylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld"><em>The Verge </em>reports</a> features an 11-inch, glasses-free 3D display and detachable controllers, all for &quot;under $1,700.&quot;</p>
<p>The Abxylute 3D One is based on a hardware prototype co-developed by Intel and Tencent that the companies demoed at CES 2025. The prototype, dubbed the &quot;Sunday Dragon 3D One,&quot; featured a display that used eye-tracking to achieve its 3D effect. The version Abxylute is selling seems to be offering more or less the same features, with an Intel Lunar Lake chip, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, an 120Hz display and a built-in kickstand.</p>

<p>&quot;Abxylute claims the productâ€™s specifically optimized to deliver 3D for 50 of the top Steam games,&quot;  <em>The Verge </em>writes<em>, </em>though it can also be used for more than gaming if you&#39;re desperate. The Abxylute 3D One will include software for converting 2D photos and video to 3D, and a detachable keyboard accessory complete with a trackpad.</p>
<p>No part of what Abxylute is offering here seems particularly practical, but if you like 3D and are into the company&#39;s maximalist approach, you could be getting a deal. Acer&#39;s 11-inch handheld, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11, starts at $1,100. A 3D laptop like the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-spatial-vision-glasses-free-3d-proart-studiobook-190053398.html">ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16</a> starts at $2,000. The Abxylute 3D One could approximate the features of both for a fairly reasonable price in the middle.</p>
<p>That might not make up for the fact that it seems too heavy to hold for more than 30 minutes at a time, but you can put that to the test yourself when the Abxylute 3D One goes on sale in &quot;late September or early October.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/abxylute-will-sell-an-absurd-3d-handheld-from-intel-and-tencent-games-for-under-1700-220556583.html?src=rss
