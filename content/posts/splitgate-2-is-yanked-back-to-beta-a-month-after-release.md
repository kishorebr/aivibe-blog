<p><em>Splitgate 2</em>, the follow-up to the hugely successful 2021 <em>Quake</em>-<em>Portal</em> hybrid concept, is returning to beta. The game <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/splitgate-2-will-exit-its-beta-and-get-an-official-release-on-june-6-185839801.html"><ins>launched</ins></a> last month, but developer 1047 Games is pulling it after deciding the release had been rushed. The company doesn&#39;t plan to release the project again until 2026.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special,&quot; the founders said in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1m6l5ec/an_update_from_the_founders/"><ins>post</ins></a> to the game&#39;s Reddit community. &quot;That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you&#39;ve been asking for, and more, which weâ€™ll share soon.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not only will the sequel go back into development, but 1047 Games is also cutting jobs. And that&#39;s after it already <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-announces-round-of-layoffs"><ins>laid off</ins></a> some team members shortly after <em>Splitgate 2</em>&#39;s initial release. The company said it will shut down the servers for the original <em>Splitgate</em> in order to reduce expenses and keep more of its team members employed.</p>
<p>1047 Games has been brutalized in the public eye after co-founder Ian Proulx appeared at Summer Games Fest wearing a hat that read &quot;Make FPS Great Again,&quot; which infuriated many of the original <em>Splitgate</em>&#39;s players. After the initial stance, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371"><ins>posted</ins></a> to the studio&#39;s X account on Splitgate 2&#39;s release date, that he was both &quot;not here to apologize&quot; and that the hat was &quot;not a political statement,&quot; Proulx finally landed on the line that it was all basically a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366"><ins>publicity stunt</ins></a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/splitgate-2-is-yanked-back-to-beta-a-month-after-release-231022772.html?src=rss
