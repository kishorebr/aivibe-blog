<p>Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251009431519/en/Nintendo-Download-Escaping-the-Spiral">just released an odd little game</a> onto the SNES Virtual Console that was previously exclusive to Japan. The simply-titled <em>Mario &amp; Wario</em> is a point-and-click puzzle game that finds the plumber on the search for his brother after his money-obsessed doppelganger drops a bucket on his head. That&#39;s the actual plot.</p>
<p>Players lead the bucket-headed Mario through 100 levels, each of which are filled with point-and-click puzzles set in a sidescrolling world. The original game was controlled via mouse and this Virtual Console release is no different. Switch owners can simply plug in a USB mouse to get going but Switch 2 owners have a niftier option.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You may remember that the new console&#39;s Joy-Con controllers can flip over and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-joy-cons-can-double-as-mouse-like-controllers-133355339.html">be used as a mouse</a>. <em>Mario &amp; Wario</em> is another use case for this concept, after <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-mouse-controlled-basketball-game-comes-out-on-august-14-163200335.html"><em>Drag x Drive</em></a> and a minigame in <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/truly-completing-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-cost-you-192255868.html"><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em></a>. The game is available right now for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only title that hit Virtual Console today. The SNES platformer <em>Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em> is available to play, as is the SNES fighter <em>Fatal Fury Special</em>. That one includes characters from both the original game and <em>Fatal Fury 2</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-a-japan-only-snes-mario-game-onto-the-virtual-console-183536913.html?src=rss
