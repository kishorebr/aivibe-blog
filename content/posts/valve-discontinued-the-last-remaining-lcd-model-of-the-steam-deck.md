<p>If you still haven&#39;t bought into the Steam Deck craze, it&#39;ll cost you a little extra to take the plunge now since Valve is only offering OLED models. Valve announced in a note on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck page</a> that it&#39;s &quot;no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model,&quot; adding that &quot;once sold out, it will no longer be available.&quot; As of this article&#39;s publishing, the $399 Steam Deck with LCD and 256 GB of storage, which we ranked as the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html">best gaming handheld</a> for most, is out of stock.

However, the LCD model offered an impressive entry price for the Steam Deck and the world of affordable gaming handhelds. Fortunately for existing owners, Valve said it plans to continue supporting the LCD models with future software updates.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, potential buyers will have to choose between the new entry-level pricing of $549 for the OLED model with 512GB of storage or upgrading to 1TB and paying at least $649. Valve&#39;s choice to discontinue its last remaining LCD model isn&#39;t surprising after it did the same with the 512GB version and the 64GB option that was available when the Steam Deck was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719-180026139.html">first released</a> in 2022.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-discontinued-the-last-remaining-lcd-model-of-the-steam-deck-171548195.html?src=rss
