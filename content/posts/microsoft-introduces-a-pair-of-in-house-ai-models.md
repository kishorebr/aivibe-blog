<p>Microsoft is expanding its AI footprint with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://microsoft.ai/news/two-new-in-house-models/"><ins>release</ins></a> of two new models that its teams trained completely in-house. MAI-Voice-1 is the tech major&#39;s first natural speech generation model, while MAI-1-preview is text-based and is the company&#39;s first foundation model trained end-to-end. MAI-Voice-1 is currently being used in the Copilot Daily and Podcast features. Microsoft has made MAI-1-preview available for public tests on LMArena, and will begin previewing it in select Copilot situations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/28/2025/microsoft-unveils-powerful-new-home-grown-ai-models"><em><ins>Semafor</ins></em></a>, Microsoft AI division leader Mustafa Suleyman said the pair of models was developed with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. MAI-Voice-1 runs on a single GPU and MAI-1-preview was trained on about 15,000 Nvidia H-100 GPUs. For context, other models, such as xAI&#39;s Grok, took more than 100,000 of those chips for training. &quot;Increasingly, the art and craft of training models is selecting the perfect data and not wasting any of your flops on unnecessary tokens that didnâ€™t actually teach your model very much,&quot; Suleyman said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although it is being used to test the in-house models, Microsoft Copilot is primarily built on OpenAI&#39;s GPT tech. The decision to build its own models, despite having sunk <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html"><ins>billion-dollar investments</ins></a> in the newer AI company, indicates that Microsoft wants to be an independent competitor in this space. While that could take time to reach parity with the companies that have emerged as forerunners in AI development, Suleyman told Semafor that Microsoft has &quot;an enormous five-year roadmap that we&#39;re investing in quarter after quarter.&quot; With some concerns arising that AI could be facing a bubble-pop, Microsoft&#39;s timeline will need to be aggressive to ensure taking the independent path is worthwhile.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-a-pair-of-in-house-ai-models-193003900.html?src=rss
