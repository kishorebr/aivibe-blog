<p>Blizzard <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> today that it is introducing the Warlock as a playable character to <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>. It brings the first new class in 25 years to this remaster of the original RPG. It’s part of the <em>Reign of the Warlock</em> DLC, which is available today and will run you $25. It also includes some other updates to the base game, including new items and a new pinnacle boss encounter against the Colossal Ancients. For those players who don’t already own the base game, you can also pick up the Infernal Edition of <em>D2R</em> for $40, which includes the new content.</p><p>When <em>D2R</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bethesda-blizzard-diablo-2-resurrected-hd-remaster-175939269.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched</a> in 2021, it was an impressively faithful recreation of the game that so many Blizzard fans continued to adore over the years. Bringing in a whole new player class is a big win for those players who have stuck with the game in its contemporary era.</p><p>If <em>D2R</em> isn&#39;t your jam, though, Warlock is also being added to both <em>Diablo 4</em> in its upcoming <em>Lord of Hatred</em> expansion this April and to <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. So aside from <em>Diablo 3</em> not getting much love, just about all fans of the franchise will have a chance to get into the demon-summoning groove.
