			Apple reportedly considers letting Anthropic and OpenAI power Siri

			
Apple is considering using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house, according to a report from Bloomberg on Monday.

The iPhone maker continues to build out a project internally dubbed “LLM Siri” that uses in-house AI models, according to Bloomberg. However, Apple has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train versions of their AI models that can run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure for testing.


	
	




	
	



Apple was forced to delay its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges the company reportedly ran into. This failure may have been a long time coming; Apple has been falling behind Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in the AI race for the last several years.

While Siri can already call on ChatGPT for difficult questions, Apple now seems to be exploring a much deeper integration with technology from third-party AI providers.
