<p>US tariffs continue to cause problems and supply issues in the gaming space. The latest to feel the effects is Analogue. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq"><ins>announced</ins></a> today that its Analogue 3D, a modern remake of the Nintendo 64 console, will not start shipping until late August.</p>
<p>Analogue noted that "last week's sudden tariffs" were the reason for this change. "We’re absorbing the costs—your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges," the company said in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1945166565114081648"><ins>post</ins></a> on X.</p>

It opened for pre-orders in October 2024 and was initially due to ship in the first quarter of 2025. In March, the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue-3d-shipping-by-july-2025-pocket-white-restock-pocketos-and-duoos-firmwar"><ins>pushed</ins></a> the ship date back to July, although its blog post didn't provide a reason for that move.</p>
<p>Many gaming brands have been forced to adapt to the fluctuating tariff rules. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-may-sell-the-switch-2-at-a-loss-in-the-us-due-to-tariffs-175857327.html"><ins>Nintendo</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-sold-778-million-ps5s-to-date-but-expects-a-downturn-due-to-tariffs-120013001.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-laptops-are-the-latest-trump-tariff-casualty-204844654.html"><ins>Razer</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/retro-handheld-maker-anbernic-stops-us-shipments-due-to-tariffs-220217833.html"><ins>Anbernic</ins></a> are just some of the companies that have changed their product pricing, availability or launches in the US as a result of the ever-changing situation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-says-its-delayed-n64-remake-console-will-start-shipping-next-month-191520648.html?src=rss
