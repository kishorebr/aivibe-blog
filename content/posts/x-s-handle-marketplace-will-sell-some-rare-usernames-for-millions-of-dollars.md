<p>X is finally following through on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-reportedly-soliciting-people-to-buy-recycled-user-handles-for-50000-174504242.html">long-rumored</a> plans <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/XHandles/status/1979714053221257393">to sell</a> old user handles, and some of the most sought-after usernames could fetch millions of dollars. The company shared more details about and opened a waitlist for its &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/">handle marketplace</a>,&quot; that will enable paying subscribers to request and buy &quot;inactive&quot; handles.</p>
<p>According to the company, X will make two types of &quot;inactive&#39; handles available: &quot;priority&quot; usernames that may include &quot;full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; handles that consist of &quot;short, generic, or culturally significant names.&quot; Subscribers to X&#39;s Premium+ and Premium Business tiers will eventually be able to request some &quot;priority&quot; handles as part of their subscription. The company says @PizzaEater and @GabrielJones are possible examples of such handles. Notably, this process requires what essentially amounts to an indefinite subscription to X Premium, as the company says it will revoke priority handles if an account&#39;s subscription lapses.</p>

<p>The process for acquiring a &quot;rare&quot; handle is a lot less clear. X says that it will offer some rare handles through &quot;public drops&quot; and that those will be given away for free &quot;based on merit&quot; and that multiple users will be able to apply. X will take a user&#39;s engagement and &quot;past contributions&quot; to the platform into account when deciding who gets these handles. The company will also make some handles available for sale via an invitation-only process. These prices will be &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;determined by a number of factors including popularity of word, character length, and cultural significance.&quot; These usernames could include common one-word usernames like @one, @fly or @compute, according to examples provided by X. They could also be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Some handles are included with a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription,&quot; X wrote in an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/how-it-works">FAQ</a>. &quot;Others – especially Rare handles – may be priced anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.&quot; People who buy a supposedly rare handle will need to have a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription in order to start the process, but won&#39;t be required to maintain one in order to keep the handle.</p>
<p>In a separate &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://legal.x.com/en/x-handle-transfer-agreement.html#:~:text=Confidential%20Information%20does%20not%20include,you%20may%20have%20with%20X.">handle transfer agreement</a>,&quot; X describes its handle-buying scheme as an &quot;evolving initiative&quot; that it hopes will be adopted by other social media companies in the future. &quot;We are establishing a new standard for social media handles—a framework we hope the broader industry will adopt, similar to how Community Notes has influenced online transparency,&quot; the company wrote.</p>
<p>Andrew Allemann, the publisher of Domain Name Wire, a publication that tracks the domain name industry, says that there are some similarities between X&#39;s plan to sell handles and the marketplace for expired domains. &quot;For a long time, people have been buying and selling handles off of X, and X hasn&#39;t been getting a cut of that,&quot; he told Engadget. &quot;So in some ways, I think this will get some of the better handles to be more used on the platform.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said he would have concerns about some of the terms in X&#39;s policies, which allow it to &quot;reclaim&#39;&#39; handles if they become inactive. The company&#39;s current &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-x-accounts">inactive account policy</a>&quot; defines an inactive account as one that hasn&#39;t been logged into for 30 days. &quot;I would definitely want a firmer contract if I were to pay money for a handle,&quot; Allemann says. &quot;I would want some rights baked into a contract that says it can&#39;t just be taken away. I certainly want a longer period of inactivity before it can be taken away.&quot;</p>
<p>X also has a history of commandeering desirable handles from users that <em>were</em> actively using them. The company took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190824506/the-man-who-once-tweeted-as-x-wasnt-informed-when-the-company-took-over-his-hand">@X handle</a> from a San Francisco photographer in 2023 without compensating him, though he was offered &quot;merch&quot; and a tour of X&#39;s headquarters. That same year, it also took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/x-commandeers-music-handle-from-user-with-half-a-million-followers.html">@music handle</a> from a longtime user with more than a half million followers. Last year, the company swiped the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musk-takes-america-x-handle">@America</a> handle from a reported Donald Trump critic. The handle is now used by Musk&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/america">super PAC</a>.</p>
<p>X&#39;s plan to give away handles based on &quot;merit&quot; raises additional questions about who the platform could decide to reward and penalize. The company didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Allemann says that all social media users should remember they don&#39;t own any of the content they publish on company platforms. &quot;If you create your website, you control it, and people can always come to it. On social media, the single billionaire owner of it could decide they don&#39;t like you, and it&#39;s pretty much within their rights to kick you off, or demote you, or change the algorithm to impact you as well.&quot;</p>
