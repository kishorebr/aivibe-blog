<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic has updated the usage policy for its Claude AI chatbot in response to growing concerns about safety. In addition to introducing stricter cybersecurity rules, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">Anthropic now specifies</a> some of the most dangerous weapons that people should not develop using Claude.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic doesn’t highlight the tweaks made to its weapons policy <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/usage-policy-update">in the post summarizing its changes</a>, but a comparison between the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/archive/7197103a-5e27-4ee4-93b1-f2d4c39ba1e7">company’s old usage policy</a> and its new one reveals a notable difference. Though Anthropic previously prohibited the use of Claude to “produce, modify, design, market, or distribute weapons, explosives, dangerous materials or other systems designed to cause harm to or loss of human life,” the updated version expands on this by specifically prohibiting the development of high-yield explosives, along with biological, nuclear, chemical, and radiological (CBRN) weapons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/activating-asl3-protections">implemented “AI Safety Level 3” protection</a> alongside the launch of its new Claude Opus 4 model. The safeguards are designed to make the model more difficult to jailbreak, as well as to help prevent it from assisting with the development of CBRN weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its post, Anthropic also acknowledges the risks posed by agentic AI tools, including Computer Use, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276822/anthopic-claude-3-5-sonnet-computer-use-ai">lets Claude take control</a> of a user’s computer, as well as Claude Code, a tool that embeds Claude directly into a developer’s terminal. “These powerful capabilities introduce new risks, including potential for scaled abuse, malware creation, and cyber attacks,” Anthropic writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI startup is responding to these potential risks by folding a new “Do Not Compromise Computer or Network Systems” section into its usage policy. This section includes rules against using Claude to discover or exploit vulnerabilities, create or distribute malware, develop tools for denial-of-service attacks, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, Anthropic is loosening its policy around political content. Instead of banning the creation of all kinds of content related to political campaigns and lobbying, Anthropic will now only prohibit people from using Claude for “use cases that are deceptive or disruptive to democratic processes, or involve voter and campaign targeting.” The company also clarified that its requirements for all its “high-risk” use cases, which come into play when people use Claude to make recommendations to individuals or customers, only apply to consumer-facing scenarios, not for business use.</p>
