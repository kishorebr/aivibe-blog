<p class="has-text-align-none">Grammarly plans to acquire the buzzy email app Superhuman, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250630889937/en/Grammarly-to-Acquire-Superhuman-to-Accelerate-Its-AI-Productivity-Platform">according to a press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Email is already the “number-one use case” of Grammarly for professional users, the company says, with “the AI assistant helping to revise over 50 million emails per week across more than 20 email providers.” Buying Superhuman makes some sense, then: it gives Grammarly its own email app to showcase its product.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But based on the press release, Grammarly has broader ambitions — which, like many other tech companies, involve AI. Specifically, AI agents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Grammarly is evolving into a productivity platform for apps and agents, moving toward a multi-product company with hundreds of intelligent, task-specific agents,” the company says. “Email represents the ideal environment for this multi-agent assistance, with professionals spending more than three hours daily in their inboxes and email remaining foundational to any productivity suite.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company says this is a “future platform” that will “enable scenarios where users can work with multiple agents simultaneously,” such as a communication agent, sales agent, support agent, and marketing agent all helping you write a customer memo. But the real test will be if those plans actually pan out — and if Grammarly can compete with tools from AI giants like OpenAI and Google, which also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350395/openai-chatgpt-operator-agent-control-computer">agentic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670848/google-agent-mode-gemini-app-project-mariner-i-o-2025">ambitions</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Grammarly acquired the productivity startup Coda <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/company/grammarly-acquires-coda/">late last year</a>, with Coda co-founder and CEO Shishir Mehrotra taking over the combined company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24326135/ai-talent-wars-databricks-interview">as CEO</a>.&nbsp;</p>
