<p>If you&#39;ve ever had something go wrong with your Facebook or Instagram account, then you probably have a good idea of just how frustrating the support process can be. The company&#39;s automated processes are so broken that some people have found that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-small-claims-court-became-metas-customer-service-hotline-160224479.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">suing Meta</a> in small claims court can be a more reliable way of getting help from the company.</p><p>Now, Meta says it&#39;s trying to address some of these longstanding issues. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/12/making-it-easier-to-access-account-support-on-facebook-and-instagram/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">an update</a>, the company acknowledged that its &quot;support hasn’t always met expectations&quot; but that a series of AI-powered updates should make it easier for people to get help.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is rolling out a new &quot;support hub&quot; on Facebook and Instagram that is meant to bring all of its support features into one place. The hub will also have a new AI chat feature so users can ask questions about account issues or Meta&#39;s policies. An in-app support hub might not be that helpful if you can&#39;t access your account, though. A Meta spokesperson pointed to its external <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/account-recovery-support/?" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">account recovery</a> tool, which is meant to help people get back into their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Recovering hacked accounts has long been a pain point for Facebook and Instagram users. But Meta says that it&#39;s now improved the process with better email and text alerts. AI has also helped the company&#39;s systems detect devices and locations you&#39;ve frequently used in the past. &quot;Our new account recovery experience adjusts to your particular situation with clearer guidance and simpler verification,&quot; Meta writes. &quot;We’ve also expanded recovery methods to include taking an optional selfie video to further verify your identity.&quot;</p><p>Meta is also starting to test a new &quot;AI support assistant&quot; on Facebook that can provide &quot;instant, personalized help&quot; for issues like account recovery or managing your profile. It&#39;s not clear how this will work, or if it will enable people to talk to an actual person who works for Meta. For now, the most reliable way to access live support is via a Meta Verified subscription, though many users report that the chat-based service <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/how-an-oregon-court-became-the-stage-for-a-115000-showdown-between-meta-and-facebook-creators-150000952.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">isn&#39;t able</a> to help with more complex issues.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said that the assistant is in the &quot;early stages of testing&quot; and is currently only available to some Facebook users globally. Those who are part of the test can find it via the app&#39;s new support hub.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Meta, these improvements have already shown some success in helping people get back into hacked accounts. The company says that this year it has &quot;increased the relative success rate of hacked account recovery by more than 30% in the US and Canada.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-fixing-its-broken-support-system-with-the-help-of-ai-185348328.html?src=rss
