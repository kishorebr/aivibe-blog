<p>Intel no longer has to fulfill certain requirements or meet milestones that it was originally supposed to under the CHIPS Act, now that the government is taking a stake in the company. According to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=46baedf0-ca0d-40aa-9a00-a75c52f80590&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvaW50ZWxzLWNoaXBzLWFjdC1yZXF1aXJlbWVudHMtd2FpdmVkLWFmdGVyLXUtcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXRha2VzLXN0YWtlLWUwZWM1Y2RiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NmJhZWRmMC1jYTBkLTQwYWEtOWEwMC1hNzVjNTJmODA1OTAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzai5jb20vdGVjaC9pbnRlbHMtY2hpcHMtYWN0LXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy13YWl2ZWQtYWZ0ZXItdS1zLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdGFrZXMtc3Rha2UtZTBlYzVjZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYZJE1phfu7sITXbKuQGxdi_MNb8S5CBADGxKmvuHtEt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fintels-chips-act-requirements-waived-after-u-s-government-takes-stake-e0ec5cdb" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/tech/intels-chips-act-requirements-waived-after-u-s-government-takes-stake-e0ec5cdb"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Intel said in a filing that it can now receive funding from the government, as long as it can show that it has already spent $7.9 billion on projects that it agreed to take on under a deal with the Commerce Department last year. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-amends-chips-act-deal-with-us-commerce-department-gets-57-billion-early-2025-08-29/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes that Intel has already spent $7.87 billion on eligible CHIPS Act-funded projects.</p>
<p>In addition, the company doesn&#39;t have to share a percentage of the total cumulative cash flow it gets from each project with the Commerce Department anymore. It doesn&#39;t have to adhere to some of the CHIPS Act&#39;s workflow policy requirements and most other restrictions, as well. However, it still can&#39;t use the funds it gets from the government for dividends and to repurchase shares.&nbsp;</p>

President Donald Trump previously <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-responds-to-trump-comments-that-he-should-resign-123008812.html">called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan</a> to resign, prompting a meeting between them that led to the new agreement. &quot;He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us 10 billion dollars for the United States,&quot; Trump said. &quot;So we picked up 10 billion.&quot; Intel eventually announced that the US government will &quot;make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock.&quot; The purchase will be made up of the $5.7 billion previously earmarked for Intel as part of the CHIPS act, while the rest ($3.2 billion) will be awarded as part of the Secure Enclave program.&nbsp;</p>
