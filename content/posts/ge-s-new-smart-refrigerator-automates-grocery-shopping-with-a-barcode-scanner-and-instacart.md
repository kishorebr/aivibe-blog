Inside the fridge, GE also includes a flush-mount LED bar with a built-in camera that can deliver &quot;real-time, on-demand snapshots of crisper drawers, focusing on the most costly and perishable items.&quot; This &quot;FridgeFocus&quot; feature is supposed to prevent you from overbuying perishable produce that you might already have, by letting you see which perishables might go bad first.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" style="height:2500px;width:2400px;" alt="A silver four door refrigerator nestled in wooden shelves." data-uuid="e2f6db31-934c-4b98-af4f-87163e27af80"/><figcaption>GE&#39;s fridge is stainless steel and has a built-in touchscreen display.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>On top of those smart features, the GE Profile Smart Refrigerator has a four-door stainless steel design, with door-in-door storage and an adjustable temperature drawer. The fridge also has an 8-inch touchscreen display for viewing recipes or the current weather conditions, and microphones for accepting voice commands. When you&#39;re dispensing water, the fridge&#39;s water dispenser is supposed to be smart enough to fill a container with the exact right amount of water using built-in sensors, too.</p><p>The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant will be available from GE and select retailers starting in April 2026 for a suggested MSRP of $4,899.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ges-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326610.html?src=rss
