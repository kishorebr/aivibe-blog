<p>IKEA has officially announced its range of Matter-compatible smart home products. The Swedish furniture store is releasing 21 new items under the tentpoles of lighting, sensors and control. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-goes-all-in-on-matter-with-new-smart-home-products-144232740.html">IKEA teased these releases</a> back in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the roll out will include updates to existing categories in order to work with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html">Matter</a>, an open source smart home standard. &quot;We&#39;re upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges,&quot; Stjepan Begic, product developer at IKEA. &quot;Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the products themselves, 11 come as part of the KAJPLATS smart bulb range. They will have a mix of shapes and sizes, along with dimming functionality. Then there&#39;s the five smart sensors., starting with an indoor and outdoor motion sensor called MYGGSPRAY, which automatically turns on lights. Similarly, there&#39;s MYGGBETT, which sends a notification when a door or window gets opened or closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the more technical safety side are sensors like TIMMERFLOTTE, which monitors temerature and humidity. Then there&#39;s ALPSTUGA, an air quality sensor and KLIPPBOK, a water leakage sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing the lineup is a range of remote controls and one smart plug, GRILLPLATS, which works with regular lamps and appliances to turn them on and off, along with tracking energy use. Then there&#39;s the four BILRESA products, starting with a dual button remote control that can turn lights on and off, adjust the brightness, and create a preset scene. Meanwhile, the remote control with a scroll wheel does similar functions, along with dimming. Two kits of three controls each are available for each type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html">IKEA</a> doesn&#39;t include exact pricing or release dates, noting that it might vary market to market. In its July teaser, the company said these products would be available come January next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new products will further bolster IKEA&#39;s smart home lineup, which often alternates between hot and cold. For instance, the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html">DIRIGERA smart hub</a> debuted as far back as 2022, but the Swedish furnishing giant and Sonos <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html">dissolved their partnership</a> earlier this year, despite the fact that many users (<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">including us</a>) found them to be an affordable alternative to more pricey Sonos-branded options.&nbsp;</p>
