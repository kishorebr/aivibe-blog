<p>Meta is formally sectioning off Horizon Worlds, the closest thing it has to a metaverse, from its Quest VR platform, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a new blog post</a> from Samantha Ryan, Meta&#39;s VP of Content, Reality Labs. While the decision runs counter to Meta&#39;s original plan to own an immersive virtual world that could serve as the future home for all online interaction, it fits with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the recent cuts</a> it made to its costly Reality Labs division, and Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">public commitment</a> to focus the company on AI hardware like smart glasses going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’re explicitly separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow,&quot; Ryan writes in the blog post. &quot;We’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile. By breaking things down into two distinct platforms, we’ll be better able to clearly focus on each.&quot;</p><p>Meta has been developing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-starts-testing-horizon-worlds-on-mobile-and-the-web-114028350.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">mobile and web versions of Horizon Worlds</a> in parallel with its VR app since at least 2023. Switching Worlds to being a mobile-first software platform isn&#39;t good for VR diehards, but it does make it a more natural competitor to something like <em>Roblox</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, which also offer user-created and monetizable worlds and games. It&#39;s also a business Meta believes it can more easily scale because of its ability to connect games to &quot;billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks.&quot;</p><p>While Meta shuttered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-closed-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-its-metaverse-cuts-202720670.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">several of its own VR game studios</a> earlier this year, it still wants to support third-party developers publishing games on its platform. The company says new monetization tools, better discoverability, a &quot;Deals&quot; tab and more ways for developers to talk to their customers should help make a difference. Maintaining the Quest&#39;s library of games could also be critical going forward. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-delays-new-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-phoenix-2025-12" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Business Insider </em>reported</a> in December 2025 that Meta was working on a gaming-focused Quest headset, and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M5Gz0xQd8c" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">confirmed</a> earlier this February that the company still had multiple Quest devices on its roadmap.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-metaverse-is-going-mobile-first-233030532.html?src=rss
