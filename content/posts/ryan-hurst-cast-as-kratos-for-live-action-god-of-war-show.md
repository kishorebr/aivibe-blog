<p>Amazon&#39;s upcoming <em>God of War</em> live-action TV adaptation has cast Ryan Hurst as its Kratos. Sony <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Sony/status/2011530631533182982?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> the casting today on X with a brief post and an image of both Hurst and Kratos in full scowl mode. Hurst is already sporting a very Kratos-style beard, so he&#39;s already got the right vibe going for him. He has past credits on familiar shows such as <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and <em>The Walking Dead</em>. The upcoming Amazon series also isn&#39;t his first rodeo acting in this universe; Hurst voiced Thor in the video game <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>. But the most important question with this casting news is whether Hurst will even try to match Christopher Judge&#39;s spectacular delivery of that single, essential word: &quot;Boy.&quot; Because is it even <em>God of War</em> without that signature line?</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet Ryan Hurst, your Kratos in the God of War series coming to Prime Video. <a href="https://t.co/OPwXk2v1Hx">pic.twitter.com/OPwXk2v1Hx</a></p>— Sony (@Sony) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sony/status/2011530631533182982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Loads of video games have been getting the TV treatment in the past few years, and several of the translations have been pretty dang excellent. That trend may be boosted by the increasingly cinematic nature of AAA gaming, but getting the right team behind and in front of the camera can also improve how successful the adaptation is. The involvement of Todd Howard in the <em>Fallout</em> show and Neil Druckmann in <em>The Last of Us</em> surely helped those shows stay true to the heart of their souce material.
