<p>Texas is suing Wi-Fi router maker TP-Link for deceptively marketing the security of its products and allowing Chinese hacking groups to access Americans&#39; devices, Attorney General Ken Paxton <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-sues-tp-link-allowing-ccp-access-americans-devices-first-several-lawsuits" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a>.

The lawsuit also says that firmware vulnerabilities in TP-Link&#39;s hardware have already &quot;exposed millions of consumers to severe cybersecurity risks.&quot;</p><p>TP-Link provided the following statement to Engadget in response to the lawsuit: </p><blockquote><p>The claims made by the Texas Attorney General’s office are without merit and will be proven false. TP-Link Systems Inc. is an independent American company. Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP exercises any form of ownership or control over TP-Link, its products, or its user data. TP-Link’s founder and CEO, Jeffrey Chao, resides in Irvine, CA, and is not and never has been a member of the CCP. To ensure the highest level of security, our core operations and infrastructure are located entirely within the United States, and all U.S. users&#39; networking data is stored securely on Amazon Web Services servers. We will continue to vigorously defend our reputation as a trusted provider of secure connectivity for American families.</p></blockquote><p>TP-Link was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/tp-link-routers-are-being-investigated-by-several-us-authorities-151552304.html" data-i13n="slk:reportedly being investigated;cpos:5;pos:1">reportedly being investigated</a> at the federal level in 2024 after its devices were connected to the massive <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-report-details-vast-spying-by-china-linked-telecom-hackers-010347224.html" data-i13n="slk:&quot;Salt Typhoon&quot; hack;cpos:6;pos:1">&quot;Salt Typhoon&quot; hack</a> that accessed data from multiple US telecom companies.
