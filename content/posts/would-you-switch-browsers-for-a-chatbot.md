<p class="has-text-align-none">Hi, friends! Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 87, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you're new here, welcome, happy It's Officially Too Hot Now Week, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.) </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, I've been reading about <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sabrina-carpenter-new-album-mans-best-friend-fame-1235359144/"><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/world/europe/khaby-lame-detained-immigration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"><strong>Khaby Lame</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/16/how-i-learned-to-become-an-intimacy-coordinator"><strong>intimacy coordinators</strong></a>, finally making a dent in <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/barbarians-at-the-gate-bryan-burroughjohn-helyar?variant=32206878539810"><strong><em>Barbarians at the Gate</em></strong></a><em>, </em>watching all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rejectedjokes/videos"><strong><em>Ben Schwartz and Friends</em></strong></a><em> </em>I can find on YouTube<em>, </em>planning my days with the <a href="https://www.finalist.works/beta-3-begins/"><strong>new Finalist beta</strong></a>, recklessly installing all the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/"><strong>Apple developer betas</strong></a> after WWDC, thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Qm6_lEdcQ"><strong>Dakota Johnson's current press tour</strong></a>, and trying to clear all my inboxes before I go on parental leave. It's… going.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I also have for you a much-awaited new browser, a surprise update to a great photo editor, a neat trailer for a meh-looking movie, a classic Steve Jobs speech, and much more. Slightly shorter issue this week, sorry; there's just a lot going on, but I didn't want to leave y'all hanging entirely. Oh, and: <strong>we'll be off next week</strong>, for Juneteenth, vacation, and general summer chaos reasons. We'll be back in full force after that, though! Let's get into it.</p>
