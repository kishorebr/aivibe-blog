<p>Indie game hit <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> has been keeping players (fittingly) enthralled since its original launch in 2022 with several free content updates, such as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-is-finally-getting-a-co-op-mode-but-its-local-only-180715026.html"><em><ins>Unholy Alliance</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sins-of-the-flesh-adds-longevity-and-sex-to-cult-of-the-lamb-130041583.html"><em><ins>Sins of the Flesh</ins></em></a>. At the Opening Night Live of Gamescom 2025, the roguelike unveiled its next update, titled <em>Woolhaven</em>. The paid DLC will arrive early next year, but no price has been set yet.</p>
<p><em>Woolhaven</em> introduces a dangerous new mountain zone to the game, where you&#39;ll find two new dungeons to conquer and as well as a spreading corruption called Rot. And you&#39;d expect from the main story, your choices about how to deal with the mountain&#39;s denizens have no right or easy answers. Things will also get frosty for your settlement with the addition of blizzards and freezing temperatures that create new reasons for followers to doubt your all-knowing guidance. But you can also keep them happy with the new ranching system for raising rare animals that can provide your cult with wool, food and a pretty sweet ride.</p>
