OpenAI is asking Meta to produce evidence related to any coordinated plans with Elon Musk and xAI to acquire or invest in the ChatGPT-maker.

The request was made public in a brief filed Thursday in Elon Musk’s ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI. Lawyers representing OpenAI said they subpoenaed Meta in June for documents related to its potential involvement in Musk’s unsolicited, $97 billion bid to takeover the startup in February. It’s unclear from the filing whether such documents exists. OpenAI ultimately denied Musk’s bid.


	
	




	
	



OpenAI’s lawyers say they discovered that Musk communicated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning xAI’s bid to purchase the ChatGPT-maker, including “about potential financing arrangements or investments.” 

Meta objected to OpenAI’s initial subpoena in July; the ChatGPT-maker’s lawyers are now seeking a court order to obtain such evidence. OpenAI is also asking the court for any of Meta’s documents and communications related to “any actual or potential restructuring or recapitalization of OpenAI” — the core issue in Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed TechCrunch towards a section of OpenAI’s filing which states that neither Meta nor Zuckerberg signed Musk’s letter of intent to acquire the ChatGPT-maker. 

Meta declined to comment further. OpenAI and legal counsel for Musk did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

In the background of OpenAI’s fight with Musk, Meta has significantly invested in its own efforts to develop frontier AI models. In 2023, Meta executives obsessed over developing an AI model that could beat OpenAI’s GPT-4, court filings in another case revealed. By early 2025, Meta’s AI models fell behind the industry standard, reportedly infuriating Zuckerberg.
