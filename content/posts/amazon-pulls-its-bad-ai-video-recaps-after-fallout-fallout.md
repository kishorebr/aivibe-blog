<p>Amazon has responded to viewers catching errors in its AI-generated season recaps by apparently pulling them from Prime Video. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-adds-ai-generated-video-recaps-for-select-prime-video-shows-190758346.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced its new Video Recaps feature</a> in November as a way to make it easier to jump into a new season of a show, but the feature had issues: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-ai-generated-recap-tool-didnt-watch-fallout-very-closely-215712958.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">A recap created for <em>Fallout</em></a> included factual errors about the plot and the setting of the show.</p><p>On Prime Video, recaps can be played in the &quot;Extras&quot; section if you&#39;re watching on the web, or via a dedicated &quot;recap button&quot; on the show&#39;s page, according to Amazon&#39;s original <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/ai-plot-summary-video-recaps-prime-video" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Video Recaps announcement</a>. If you head to the <em>Fallout  s</em>eason two page now, the erroneous recap has been removed. In fact, at least on the web, there are currently no video recaps available on the show&#39;s Amazon was testing the feature on, which includes <em>Fallout, Bosch, Upload, The Rig</em> and <em>Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan</em>.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Amazon for more information on why the recaps were removed. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>Video Recaps are just one of the ways Amazon is trying to integrate AI into its different products and services. The company offered AI-generated English dubs for select anime shows on Prime Video, before it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/amazon-halts-ai-anime-dub-beta-after-widespread-ridicule-141501051.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">pulled the dubs</a> after users complained. Amazon also uses AI to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-will-use-ai-to-generate-recaps-for-book-series-on-the-kindle-170018503.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">generate recaps</a> for long-running book series that are sold through the Kindle Store.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-pulls-its-bad-ai-video-recaps-after-fallout-fallout-220358758.html?src=rss
