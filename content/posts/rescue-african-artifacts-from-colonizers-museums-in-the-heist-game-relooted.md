<p><em>Relooted</em> is a heist game about reclaiming African artifacts from the Western countries that stole them, developed by independent South African studio <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://nyamakop.co.za/">Nyamakop</a>. <em>Relooted</em> is set in a future timeline where Western nations have signed a treaty to return plundered items to their African regions of origin, but things aren't going to plan. Western leaders are instead hiding the artifacts away in private collections, so it's up to a ragtag crew based in Johannesburg, South Africa, to strategize and steal them back.</p>
<p><em>Relooted</em> is broken into missions, and each one includes a briefing about the artifact, an infiltration planning stage, and the heist. Gameplay is a mix of puzzle and action as you case each building, set up your run, and then execute the plan. Once you grab your target artifact, the security alarms go off and you have a limited amount of time to escape, so thorough preparation is key.</p>

<p>In the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-day-of-the-devs-at-summer-game-fest-2025-150047219.html">Day of the Devs</a> reveal video for <em>Relooted</em>, producer Sithe Ncube cites a wild statistic from a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.about-africa.de/images/sonstiges/2018/sarr_savoy_en.pdf">pivotal 2018 report</a> on African cultural heritage, saying, "90 percent of sub-Saharan African culture heritage is in the possession of Western collections. That is millions upon millions of deeply important cultural, spiritual and personal artifacts, including human remains, that aren't in their rightful place."</p>
<p>The locations in <em>Relooted</em> are fictional, but the 70 artifacts you have to steal back are real, and they're all currently in Western and private collections, far from their original homes and owners.</p>
<p>Nyamakop is one of the largest independent games studios in sub-Saharan Africa, with about 30 developers working on <em>Relooted</em> right now. Its previous game, the globular platformer <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://semblance-game.com/"><em>Semblance</em></a>, was the first African-developed IP to ever come to a Nintendo console, hitting the Switch in 2018. In order to get <em>Semblance</em> on the Switch, Nyamakop co-founder Ben Myres had to bootstrap his way around the world, buying one-way tickets and finding new partners on the fly in a daisy chain of game festival appearances. Here's how Myres explained it <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-semblance-south-africa-nintendo-switch-indie-e3-hands-on.html">to Engadget at E3 2018</a>:</p>
<p>"The entry curve into being an indie game developer in South Africa is like a cliff face. Because you don't have the contacts, the platform holders like Xbox, Sony. You don't have reps that live in your country. The press that matter are all here. There isn't a big enough market locally to sell to, so you have to make works to sell to the West, which means you have to go to Western shows and you have to meet Western press. So basically, if you're not traveling a ton, you're not going to be able to make it."</p>

<p>Nyamakop has grown significantly since 2018, and <em>Relooted</em> is an unabashedly African game built by a majority-POC team, Myres and Ncube said in 2024.</p>
<p>"There is the thing about making games for Africans â€” we say that a lot," Ncube told <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nyamakop-theres-demand-for-african-created-content-outside-of-the-continent"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. "We say that should be a thing, we should make games for Africans because we're playing games that were made in the West. But will people even play those games, if you make them? And then if you make games targeting people ... even if you were to make one that's really good, there's no guarantee that you'll have a lot of people playing it. So I think there's some level of confusion, I can say, in terms of unexplored aspects of the African games market."</p>
