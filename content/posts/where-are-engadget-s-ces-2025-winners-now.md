But before diving into what’s new, we thought it was a good idea to revisit our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2025-the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-saw-in-las-vegas-211535722.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best of show winners from last year</a> to see where they're at. After all, CES is synonymous with vaporware. The good news is the Engadget team has a keen sense for BS. Of the ones we awarded at CES 2025 that&nbsp;haven’t&nbsp;been released, most are coming this year. For the remaining few, we’ll be hunting them down this CES.</p><h2 id="538e0694-e1ec-4de3-be12-272ac87e964c">ASUS Zenbook A14</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-a14.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-a14.jpg" style="height:1420px;width:2400px;" alt="An Asus Zenbook A14 sits out a patio table.
