<p>Just a day after receiving a roughly <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-hit-with-140-million-fine-from-the-eu-161259324.html">$140 million fine</a>, X has terminated the ad account of the European Commission. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1997450541275005041?s=20">Nikita Bier</a>, X&#39;s head of product, accused the European Commission of using an exploit to artificially boost the reach of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/EU_Commission/status/1996968219286904832?s=20">its post announcing</a> the major fine.</p>
<p>In the post, Bier said that the commission &quot;logged into [their] dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer&quot; and posted &quot;a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.&quot; Bier explained in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1997454552854065272?s=20">separate post</a> that the exploit has &quot;never been abused like this&quot; and &quot;is now patched.&quot; However, X still revoked the European Commission&#39;s ability to buy and track ads on its platform.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While X decided to remove the European Commission&#39;s ad account, it still needs to submit specific measures and an action plan to address the concerns associated with the $140 million fine. The European Commission&#39;s spokesperson for Tech Sovereignty, Defence, Space and Research, Thomas Regnier, said that this is the first-ever fine under the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/ireland-is-investigating-tiktok-and-linkedin-for-possible-dsa-violations-194519622.html">Digital Services Act</a>. The European legislative body claimed that X has a deceptive system when it comes to verified accounts, lacks transparency with its advertising repository and doesn&#39;t provide effective data for researchers. In response, X&#39;s owner, Elon Musk, replied to the European Commission&#39;s post, calling it &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1997009604681896340">bullshit</a>.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-shuts-down-the-european-commissions-ad-account-the-day-after-major-fine-173553267.html?src=rss
