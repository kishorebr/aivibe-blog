<p>If your TikTok feed has felt a little off lately, it&#39;s not just you. TikTok says is still working to fix its service in the US following a power outage at one of its data centers that&#39;s caused “multiple bugs” in the app. TikTok users have reported problems logging in and uploading videos, as well as strange behavior from the &quot;for you&quot; algorithm. Creators have also noticed that new uploads are seemingly getting o views or likes and that in-app earnings have disappeared. </p><p>&quot;Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,&quot; the company wrote in a statement Monday. &quot;We&#39;re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We&#39;re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate.

</div><p>The statement didn’t directly address reported issues with the app’s recommendation algorithm. Since Sunday, users have reported seeing a wave of generic videos flood their feeds, which are typically hyper-personalized. Other users have reported seeing the same few videos repeated over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>The issues come just days after TikTok finalized a deal to spin off its US business into a separate entity <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-finalizes-deal-for-its-us-entity-010543484.html" data-i13n="slk:largely controlled;cpos:1;pos:1">largely controlled</a> by US investors. That timing hasn&#39;t gone unnoticed by users, many of whom are already suspicious of the company pushing a terms of service and privacy policy in the hours after the deal was finalized.&nbsp;The problems affecting the app&#39;s recommendation algorithm have also raised questions about TikTok USDS Joint Venture&#39;s plans to &quot;retrain&quot; TikTok&#39;s central feature. </p><p><strong>Update, January 26, 2026, 4:18PM PT: </strong>This post has been updated to include additional information from TikTok about the outage and bugs affecting users.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-tiktok-us-power-outage-caused-a-cascading-systems-failure-leading-to-multiple-bugs-173426490.html?src=rss
