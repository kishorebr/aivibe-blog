<p>NVIDIA has taken a big step towards strengthening its domestic chip manufacturing, revealing the first <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tsmc-blackwell-manufacturing/">Blackwell wafer</a> made in the US. The hardware company assembled the wafer, which is the base material for NVIDIA&#39;s AI chips, in TSMC&#39;s semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NVIDIA revealed its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-gpus-powered-the-ai-revolution-its-new-blackwell-chips-are-up-to-30-times-faster-001059577.html">Blackwell platform</a> last year, boasting a goal of revolutionizing the AI industry through tech giants like Amazon, Google, OpenAI and others who already committed to adopting the next-gen architecture. NVIDIA said the latest platform was more powerful and translated to 25x less cost and energy consumption compared to its predecessor. Now that Blackwell wafers can be made at the TSMC plant, NVIDIA can better insulate itself from the ever-evolving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-threatens-a-25-percent-tariff-on-all-smartphones-not-made-in-the-us-195122531.html">tariff situation</a> and geopolitical tensions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States,” Jensen Huang, NVIDIA&#39;s founder and CEO, said at the celebration event.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA&#39;s Blackwell architecture ready for the volume production stage, the company is still working on expanding its manufacturing footprint across the US. Earlier this year, NVIDIA said it had plans to funnel half a trillion dollars towards building <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-manufacture-american-made-ai-supercomputers-us/">AI infrastructure</a> in the US through partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn and other companies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-shows-off-its-first-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-in-the-us-192836249.html?src=rss
