<p>If your Gmail inbox is all out of whack today, you&#39;re not alone. Gmail users have been encountering issues with the automatic filters that keep their main inbox free from the clutter of promotional emails and non-urgent updates, and some have reported seeing notices that emails have not been scanned for spam. Google confirmed to Engadget and in an update on its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/incidents/NNnDkY9CJ36annsfytjQ" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Workspace status dashboard</a> that it&#39;s aware of the problems, and is currently working on a fix.&nbsp;</p><p>On social media and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">DownDetector</a>, some Gmail users have also reported delays in receiving messages, leading to issues with two-factor authentication logins. Google noted that the problem has resulted in the &quot;misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings,&quot; including a banner that says, “Be careful with this message. Gmail hasn&#39;t scanned this message for spam, unverified senders, or harmful software.” In a statement to Engadget, a Google spokesperson echoed the message from its status dashboard, saying, &quot;We are actively working to resolve the issue. As always, we encourage users to follow standard best practices when engaging with messages from unknown senders.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-says-its-working-to-fix-gmail-issue-thats-led-to-flooded-inboxes-and-increased-spam-warnings-183358654.html?src=rss
