<p>CES 2026 is already shaping up to be an interesting year for robots. But while some companies are chasing humanoids that can help you do stuff, there are also a surprising number of robots whose main job is to be cute and keep you company.</p><p>Japanese startup Ludens AI is showing off two extremely adorable robot companions at CES. Cocomo is an autonomous robot pet that can follow you around the house and respond to voice and touch. It has a fuzzy, egg-shaped body, but the version we saw at CES was wearing an orange suit with ears that made it look a bit like a teddy bear. It was moving around on a wheeled base, but it also has tiny legs if you prefer to carry it around and hold it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cocoo&#39;s exterior is meant to stay close to human body temperature at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and the company says it will rise up to 102 degrees in &quot;high contact&quot; situations like hugging it. And while Cocomo can interact and respond to your actions, it &quot;speaks&quot; with hums and other sounds rather than words.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ludens AI brought some very cute robots to CES 2026. This is Cocomo, a robot pet that&#39;s designed to be a companion. It can follow you around and learn about you over time. <a href="https://t.co/rj6dLXN4h4">pic.twitter.com/rj6dLXN4h4</a></p>— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) <a href="https://twitter.com/karissabe/status/2008000005131636778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>We didn&#39;t get to witness many of its abilities in action due to the loud environment, but Ludens says that Cocomo is designed to bond with its owners over time. &quot;Cocomo engages through spontaneous gestures, imitation, and gentle initiation - learning what makes you laugh, what comforts you, and when to surprise you,&quot; the company says.&nbsp;</p><p>Ludens&nbsp;didn&#39;t share pricing or availability info for Cocomo, but has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ludensai.com/cocomo" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a waitlist</a> where you can sign up for updates in a forthcoming crowdfunding campaign.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo_long.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo_long.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Ludens AI&#39;s Inu robot." data-uuid="a248fdb6-1c3f-4132-bbbf-32fa7bd52602"/><figcaption>Ludens AI&#39;s Inu robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Ludens also showed off a smaller, but also very adorable, robot called Inu, which it describes as a &quot;desktop alien pupu.&quot; Rather than a robot that can move with you from room to room, Inu is meant to sit on your desk and keep you company while you work. It can also interact via audio and movement. It has a little tail that wiggles in response to voice and touch and its single eye can &quot;blink.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Ludens plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign for Inu later this year.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/japanese-startup-ludens-ai-brought-two-very-adorable-robots-to-ces-2026-021914130.html?src=rss
