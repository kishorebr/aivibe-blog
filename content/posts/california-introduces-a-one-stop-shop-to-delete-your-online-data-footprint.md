<p>Californians can now put a stop to their personal data being sold around on an online trading floor, thanks to a new free tool. On January 1, the state launched its Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, shortened to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/">DROP</a>, that allows residents to request to delete all of their personal information online that&#39;s been harvested by data brokers.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/californias-new-law-makes-it-easier-for-consumers-to-request-the-deletion-of-their-data-095555419.html">California Privacy Protection Agency</a> (CalPrivacy), which was responsible for DROP&#39;s release, it&#39;s a &quot;first of its kind&quot; tool that imposes new restrictions on businesses that hoard and sell personal info that consumers didn&#39;t provide directly. The process requires verifying your California residency before you can send a &quot;single deletion request to every registered data broker in California.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the other end, CalPrivacy will require <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/house-passes-bill-that-would-bar-data-brokers-from-selling-americans-personal-information-to-adversary-countries-004735748.html">data brokers</a> to register every year and to process any deletion requests from DROP. Data brokers will also have to report the type of information they collect and share, while also being subject to regular audits that check for compliance. If any data broker is found skirting the requirements, they could face penalties and fines.</p>
<p>Besides being the first in the country to offer this type of comprehensive tool that deletes online personal data, CalPrivacy said it&#39;s one of four states, including Oregon, Texas and Vermont, to require data broker registration. According to the agency, data brokers will start processing the first deletion requests from DROP starting August 1, 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss
