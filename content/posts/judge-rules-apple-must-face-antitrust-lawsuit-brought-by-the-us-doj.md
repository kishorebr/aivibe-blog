"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court," a spokesperson from Apple said.</p>
<p>The DOJ and several states filed the lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Their argument was that Apple had created a monopoly over app software.

Apple quickly <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-refutes-every-claim-made-in-dojs-antitrust-lawsuit-123223870.html">responded</a> with a rebuttal of all the claims made in the lawsuit. The company filed for a dismissal of the case in August.</p>
