<p>Hisense is perhaps best known for its budget-friendly electronics and appliances, like TVs and refrigerators.

So what&#39;s on deck for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.</p>
<p>The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o"><ins>press release</ins></a>, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &quot;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch">How to watch</h2>
<p>Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/ces-2026">its website</a>. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/exclusive-hisense-is-betting-on-rgb-tvs-to-shake-up-the-industry-and-make-rivals-nervous"><ins>Tom&#39;s Guide</ins></a>, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.</p>
<p>As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html"><ins>Samsung</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html"><ins>LG</ins></a> have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html?src=rss
