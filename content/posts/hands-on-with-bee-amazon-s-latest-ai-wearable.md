In early tests with a review unit of Bee, we found the device itself was easy to use. It’s just a press of a button to turn recording on or off. In the app, you can configure whether a double press bookmarks a section of the conversation, processes the current conversation, or both, and you can set whether a press and hold gesture lets you leave a voice note or chat with the AI assistant. (Bee’s companion app currently reminds you to enable voice notes, so we did.)

Like many other AI products and services, such as Plaud, Granola, Fathom, Fireflies, Otter, and more, Bee can listen, record, and transcribe audio conversations. Where it differs is that instead of offering an overview or a raw transcript, it segments the audio into sections and summarizes each part. For instance, an interview might be segmented into sections like the introduction, the nitty-gritty product details, an overview of industry trends, and whatever else you may have talked about.


	
	




	
	



Each section is tinted with a different background color for easier differentiation as you scroll. You can tap into an individual section to see the exact transcription.

It wasn’t immediately obvious how to label the speakers in the app — we learned we could tap on a segment of the conversation to confirm if we were the speaker, but this fell short of other professional AI transcribers, where each speaker could be labeled. In addition, Bee discards the audio after transcription, making it a non-starter for use cases where you need to play back the audio to ensure accuracy. 

That said, Bee isn’t necessarily meant to be a work tool. Amazon sees this as an AI that can live alongside you as you go about your day. By integrating with Google’s services, Bee can tie a recorded conversation to a task. For instance, after meeting someone at a conference, it could suggest that you friend them on LinkedIn or research their product.
