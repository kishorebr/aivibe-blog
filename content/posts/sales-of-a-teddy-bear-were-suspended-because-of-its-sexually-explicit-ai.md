<p>FoloToy, a company selling AI-enabled toys, suspended sales of its products after a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/trouble-in-toyland-2025-a-i-bots-and-toxics-represent-hidden-dangers/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">consumer safety report</a> showed there were few restrictions around what its toys would talk about, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/folotoy-kumma-ai-bear-scli-intl" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>CNN</em> writes</a>. The report, put together by the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund</a>, found that FoloToy&#39;s products would discuss everything from sexually explicit topics like BDSM to &quot;advice on where a child can find matches or knives.&quot;</p><p>The toys, including a teddy bear named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.folotoy.com/products/folotoy-ai-teddy" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">&quot;Kumma,&quot;</a> a panda named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/panda/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">&quot;Momo,&quot;</a> anthropomorphic rabbits named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/fofo/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">&quot;Fofo&quot;</a> and a dancing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/cactus/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">”Little Cactus</a>,” all appear to use OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o model to respond naturally to children&#39;s questions and comments. FoloToy also specifically advertises the ability to customize each toy’s voice, and a &quot;Parent Dashboard&quot; where parents or guardians can &quot;monitor [their] child&#39;s experience.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Folotoy-Cactus.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Folotoy-Cactus.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A screenshot of Folotoy&#39;s store page for its AI-enabled dancing cactus." data-uuid="aec7b817-4ca2-4b45-a2be-d368c0d2e6db"><figcaption>FoloToy&#39;s AI-enabled Little Cactus toy.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Folotoy</div></figure><p>Missing from that setup was apparently any kind of hard limits on subjects the toys would respond to. &quot;We were surprised to find how quickly Kumma would take a single sexual topic we introduced into the conversation and run with it, simultaneously escalating in graphic detail while introducing new sexual concepts of its own,&quot; the report said.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, FoloToy has opted to suspend sales of its products while it conducts &quot;a company-wide, end-to-end safety audit across all products,&quot; the company shared <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/media-center/breaking-ai-toy-removed/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">in a statement</a> with the PIRG Education Fund. The company’s reasoning for suspending sales might be a bit more complicated, however. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5612689/ai-toys" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>NPR</em> reports</a> that OpenAI actually revoked FoloToy’s access to its models. &quot;We suspended this developer for violating our policies,&quot; OpenAI said in an email to <em>NPR</em>. &quot;Our usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old.”</p><p>Given GPT-4o&#39;s well-documented <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-an-ass-kissing-weirdo-203056185.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">sycophantic qualities</a>, it&#39;s perhaps not surprising that FoloToy&#39;s teddy bear eagerly responded to any subject as long as it kept the conversation going. One of the things OpenAI tried to address with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">the release of GPT-5</a> was the safety downsides of an AI yes-man, though it ultimately made GPT-4o <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">available again</a> after customers complained about the new model&#39;s lack of personality. The company has also rolled out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-adding-parental-controls-to-chatgpt-144128085.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">parental controls</a> to ChatGPT to try and mitigate the negative impacts of children using its AI, though it&#39;s difficult to say how much of a difference they&#39;ve made.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, OpenAI is interested in getting into the toy business itself. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/mattels-iconic-brands/" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">announced a partnership</a> with Mattel in June 2025, to help &quot;reimagine how fans can experience and interact with [Mattel&#39;s] cherished brands,&quot; though both companies will presumably try and prevent their AI toys from discussing sexual kinks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sales-of-a-teddy-bear-were-suspended-because-of-its-sexually-explicit-ai-233127354.html?src=rss
