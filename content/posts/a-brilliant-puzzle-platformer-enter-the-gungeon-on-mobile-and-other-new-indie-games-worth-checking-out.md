<p>Welcome to our latest recap of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Quite a few intriguing games dropped this week and some high-profile ones have been ported to more platforms. Before we get to those, though, I&#39;d like to tell you about one of my favorite games of the year so far.</p>
<p>I struggle to fully engage with many RPGs. By and large, I&#39;m not interested in spending lots of time optimizing my character, speccing out a skill tree or scouring for the very best equipment to match my playstyle. I find it far more interesting when a game offers a limited toolset and a huge variety of ways to use those mechanics, typically by providing a small number of abilities and powerups as well as really clever level design.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Such is the case with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/"><em>Öoo</em></a>, which arrived on Steam last week and is the latest game from <em>Elechead </em>developer Nama Takahashi. This is a puzzle-platformer that you can complete in one sitting and it&#39;s utterly captivating.</p>
<p>You play as a caterpillar that uses a bomb — and later a second one — to blow stuff up and move around. If you want to reach a higher platform, you&#39;ll need to detonate a bomb you&#39;re sitting on. The controls are simple too, as you only need to move, and drop and blow up bombs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design of this game, though, is anything but simple. There&#39;s almost no text here, even in the menus. You learn by experimenting and figuring out how to navigate what&#39;s in front of you. You&#39;ll have to backtrack a bit to solve certain puzzles. It&#39;s so mechanically tight that a 15-second trailer is all you need to understand what <em>Öoo </em>is about:</p>
<div id="80e7c59648f846ee8adfcd4b41a70d30"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXQmJBsrciI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>I smiled the entire way through this one — even when I got momentarily stumped — and I let out a satisfied chuckle or two when I figured out solutions to problems. It helps that the visuals (by artist Hachinos) and audio are charming as hell. The title of the game is absolutely terrific, too. The umlaut is important because it makes the lettering look like your character with a pair of bombs trailing behind it. This is emblematic of the level of thought, care and detail that Takahashi and co. have put into <em>Öoo</em>. That extends to the end credits, which lists several games that inspired this one. Such a beautiful touch.</p>
<p><em>Öoo </em>reminds me a bit of <em>Animal Well</em>. It doesn&#39;t have nearly the same level of depth as one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2024-133005519.html">our favorites of 2024</a>, but it doesn&#39;t need to. It&#39;s perfect the way it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also brings to mind another perfect game, <em>Poinpy</em>, with even composer Tsuyomi&#39;s work reminding me of that game&#39;s fantastic music. I&#39;m still sad that it&#39;s impossible for me to play <em>Poinpy </em>right now, as it vanished from Netflix&#39;s catalog a while back. But <em>Öoo </em>did a bang up job of filling that hole in my heart. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there&#39;s a lovely little indie you can pick up for free on the Epic Games Store right now for PC, Android and (in the EU) iOS. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hidden-folks-239d16"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a> is a relaxing hidden object game by Adriaan de Jongh that features hand-drawn environments and funny, voice-generated sound effects. I&#39;m only a little ways into this but I&#39;m enjoying it so far. This week&#39;s other Epic Games freebie on PC is ragdoll physics sim <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/totally-reliable-delivery-service"><em>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</em></a>.</p>
<p>Also, as a quick reminder, there will be a ton of video game news dropping over the next week as the world&#39;s biggest gaming event, Gamescom, is taking place. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html">Check out our Gamescom preview</a> for details on what to expect and how to watch the various showcases and streams, and maybe keep your fingers crossed for a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>release date, if you&#39;re so inclined. Join us on Tuesday as we liveblog our way through Opening Night Live. We&#39;ll be bringing you the tastiest news from the event throughout the week too.</p>

<p>A bonafide indie classic hit mobile devices this week. Bullet hell dungeon crawler <em>Enter the Gungeon</em> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0eecd029-2996-434e-8c3f-152a4d39b81a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9lbnRlci10aGUtZ3VuZ2Vvbi9pZDExMDA0Mjk2NDEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBlZWNkMDI5LTI5OTYtNDM0ZS04YzNmLTE1MmE0ZDM5YjgxYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvZW50ZXItdGhlLWd1bmdlb24vaWQxMTAwNDI5NjQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVPyHlT4-H_x05b1fh60Gt0cu-qL7jG_U06U_vi-Xv2x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fenter-the-gungeon%2Fid1100429641" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enter-the-gungeon/id1100429641">iOS</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0eecd029-2996-434e-8c3f-152a4d39b81a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmRldm9sdmVyZGlnaXRhbC5lbnRlcnRoZWd1bmdlb24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBlZWNkMDI5LTI5OTYtNDM0ZS04YzNmLTE1MmE0ZDM5YjgxYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5Lmdvb2dsZS5jb20vc3RvcmUvYXBwcy9kZXRhaWxzP2lkPWNvbS5kZXZvbHZlcmRpZ2l0YWwuZW50ZXJ0aGVndW5nZW9uIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWLt3UY3rcCkZgfmvYmja68ASodyxAyTTXZqLGJLeJmQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.devolverdigital.enterthegungeon" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolverdigital.enterthegungeon">Android</a>) and its sequel, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-17-exit-the-gungeon-nintendo-switch.html">former Apple Arcade exclusive</a> <em>Exit the Gungeon</em> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0eecd029-2996-434e-8c3f-152a4d39b81a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9leGl0LXRoZS1ndW5nZW9uL2lkNjUwNDg1Mjg2NCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGVlY2QwMjktMjk5Ni00MzRlLThjM2YtMTUyYTRkMzliODFhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9leGl0LXRoZS1ndW5nZW9uL2lkNjUwNDg1Mjg2NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZyeG6Cjw0Q8lZqhOa_Y-i5e-86ahAf6F13xOcJvBCgl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fexit-the-gungeon%2Fid6504852864" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exit-the-gungeon/id6504852864">iOS</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0eecd029-2996-434e-8c3f-152a4d39b81a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLkRldm9sdmVyLkV4aXR0aGVHdW5nZW9uIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZWVjZDAyOS0yOTk2LTQzNGUtOGMzZi0xNTJhNGQzOWI4MWEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1jb20uRGV2b2x2ZXIuRXhpdHRoZUd1bmdlb24ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbMLG8pqSuQWLk_I-4iJrC4jzrhHvJPtdOvI1EJXif2B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.Devolver.ExittheGungeon" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Devolver.ExittheGungeon">Android</a>), are both free to try and you can keep playing them after making an in-app purchase.</p>
<p>These versions include touch controls, with publisher Devolver Digital pointing out that you can &quot;swipe, tap and poke your screen to conquer the depths of the Gungeon.&quot; The developers have, at long last, added online co-op so you can play with your friends without having to be in the same room. There&#39;s also a crossover here, as the Lamb from <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> becomes the latest playable character.</p>
<p>The games&#39; arrival on mobile could also give veteran Gungeon players a decent reason to revisit Dodge Roll&#39;s series. The iOS and Android ports could also help them pass the time until <em>Enter the Gungeon 2</em> arrives on Steam next year.</p>

<p>Another popular indie expanded to more platforms this week as <em>Dorfromantik</em> (previously only available on PC and Nintendo Switch) arrived on PlayStation and Xbox, thanks to the help of Headup. This strategy puzzle game from Toukana Interactive is all about building out a world using hex tiles, which makes my <em>Takenoko</em>-loving self happy. It&#39;s a chill, beautiful game that&#39;ll still get your cognitive gears turning a bit.</p>
<p>A mobile version is also in development, but it won&#39;t be a straight port of the PC and console game. Instead, Toukana is working with ClockStone on a reimagining of <em>Dorfromantik </em>that&#39;s built from the ground up for touchscreen devices.</p>

<p>TMNT went turn-based for the first time in series history with <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, which <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-comes-out-on-may-22-191533579.html">debuted on PC back in May</a>. Strange Scaffold has now brought the game to Nintendo Switch (only in North America for now) and Xbox Series X/S. It&#39;s coming to Switch in European regions at a later date.</p>
<p>PC players might have a reason to return to the game, as Strange Scaffold has updated it with a Remix Mode. This adds many more enemy types with new moves and attack patterns, as well as tougher challenges.</p>

<p><em>Ra Ra Boom </em>is a co-op, side-scrolling beat-&#39;em-up from Gylee Games that landed on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), Xbox Series X/S and PS5 this week. I love the premise, which sees ninja cheerleaders from outer space descending to Earth to free the planet from a climate change-battling AI that perhaps did its job too well by ridding it of humans. Each of the four characters has their own abilities, including a ranged weapon.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve played <em>Ra Ra Boom </em>for about 30 minutes and, unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t clicked for me so far. I might give it another shot, but there are just too many other games out there waiting to be played.</p>
<div id="d30a048556634345bc508b27a365b4d6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dhzZzpwVFto?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>I do appreciate games that are about more than giving players something fun to do. There have been quite a few over the years that aim to help people learn a language. Another arrived on Steam this week in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701720/Wagotabi_A_Japanese_Journey/"><em>Wagotabi: A Japanese Journey</em></a>, which debuted on mobile last year.</p>
<p>In this slice-of-life RPG from Wagotabi Limited, you&#39;ll explore Japan and its culture. It&#39;s designed to help players start learning Japanese and it was made with beginners in mind. It features mini games, tests and is fully voiced in Japanese. The developers say that more than 300 teachers spanning more than 60 countries have been reviewing the game, presumably to make sure its lessons are accurate.</p>
<div id="82b9154f4e5343c18c7903fd66bf7de4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CuyPGF6CSg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>The Dark Queen of Mortholme</em> has been available on <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://qwertyprophecy.itch.io/mortholme">Itch.io</a> for some time, and it landed on <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587610/The_Dark_Queen_of_Mortholme/">Steam</a> this week with new features, including support for controllers and Steam Cloud, achievements and more. In this short experience from Mosu and publisher Monster Theater, you play as the final boss of a video game who has to keep fending off a pesky hero. There are multiple endings and the one that you see is determined by your dialogue choices. <em>The Dark Queen of Mortholme </em>seems pretty interesting, and I&#39;m looking forward to checking it out.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<div id="4b56957bf3bd4788a60116c5bfa651ac"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dt4zCr5ovI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>CrisisX</em> is an ambitious-sounding survival crafting project from Hero Games. It features an 1,200 km² open-world map with 12 terrains and biomes, including snowy mountains and hidden labs. You can forge teams, groups and communes to help you fend off dangers such as infected and other players. What&#39;s really wild is that <em>CrisisX </em>will seemingly be able to support up to 5,000 players on a single server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s coming to PC, iOS and Android in the second quarter of 2026. Those who are attending Gamescom next week will be able to play it at the show, while a beta test is scheduled for later this year. I&#39;m intrigued, not least because <em>CrisisX </em>might be the closest we ever get to <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/naughty-dog-cancels-development-on-the-last-of-us-online-055333989.html"><em>The Last of Us Online</em></a>.</p>

<p>I feel like I first heard about <em>Henry Halfhead</em> forever ago, so I&#39;m glad that this sandbox adventure finally has a release date. It&#39;s coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058140/Henry_Halfhead/">PC</a> on September 16.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry is, surprisingly enough, a character that is half of a head. They&#39;re able to turn into any nearby object, and you can play as more than 250 different items. There&#39;s local co-op support too. It seems cute! <em>Henry Halfhead </em>is coming your way courtesy of Lululu Entertainment and co-publisher Popagenda.</p>
<div id="a70664da93a84dc09ee01cc79636edaf"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJds6J8-KZ4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>If not for <em>Öoo</em>, <em>The Way of the Tray</em> might have been my favorite game in a hot minute. You&#39;ll play as a waiter in a Japanese spirit world, where you&#39;ll serve orders to various spirits after catching and balancing them on your tray. Seems like one for fans of the restaurant side of <em>Dave the Diver</em>. <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/"><em>The Way of the Tray</em></a>, which is from Who is Terry and publisher Targem Games, hits Steam on August 25.</p>
<div id="e4148eb30f0d4a14a07b4f384f06aa8d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTTVBOA7XMg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/"><em>CloverPit</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a grungy, slot machine-based horror game that looks right up my alley. After all, it&#39;s billed as a &quot;demonic lovechild of <em>Balatro </em>and <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>.&quot; Sold. You have to accumulate a certain amount of cash each round to help pay off your debt, or it&#39;s off to the pit with you. It&#39;s not about gambling so much as it is finding ways to break the rules of a slot machine to help you reach your objectives.</p>
<p>There&#39;s quite a bit of buzz behind this one from Panik Arcade and publisher Future Friends Games. It&#39;s had more than 700,000 demo downloads and is among the top wishlisted games on Steam. <em>CloverPit </em>is coming to said platform on September 3.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s wrap things up for this week with a game that has a very cool aesthetic. <em>Zoe Begone! </em>is a bullet hell shooter with hand-drawn visuals. The idea here is that the action plays out on a film strip, with a devilish animator drawing and painting more enemies for our heroine, Zoe, to overcome. As you might imagine, solo developer Retchy took inspiration from drawn-on-film animation from the 1930s, particularly the work of Norman McLaren. As an admirer of Stan Brakhage&#39;s work, this speaks to me.</p>
<p><em>Zoe Begone!</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch on September 17. A demo is <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266610/ZOE_Begone/">available on Steam now</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html?src=rss
