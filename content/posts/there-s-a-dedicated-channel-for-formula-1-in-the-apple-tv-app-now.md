<p>Apple continues to double down on its Formula 1 programming, following up on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/f1-the-movie-now-streaming-on-apple-tv-following-a-long-theatrical-run-133531702.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">box office success</a> of its blockbuster movie by adding a dedicated channel for the racing league to the Apple TV app. This section of the streaming service hints at some of what may be coming when the F1 season begins with the kickoff event in Australia next month. The F1 channel has placeholders for practices, qualifying and the grand prix as well as a weekend warm-up show.</p><p>Although it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-is-the-new-home-for-f1-racing-in-the-us-starting-in-2026-133619412.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced</a> the five-year deal to host F1 broadcasts in the US back in October, we still haven&#39;t heard many specifics on how Apple&#39;s presentation of the race events will work. The channel has a section labeled &quot;Event Schedule: Sky Sports,&quot; which suggests that Apple will show the commentary from Sky rather than providing its own hosts; ESPN took that approach during its tenure with the F1 broadcast rights. In addition to the forward-looking streams, Apple TV also has some videos with highlights from the 2025 season and a recap of the rule changes for 2026.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking to follow Formula 1 in the 2026 season, some races will be available to watch for free. However, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-get-f1tv-with-your-apple-tv-subscription-171534300.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">F1 TV Premium streaming package</a> is now part of an Apple TV subscription, so that&#39;s likely to be the preferred ticket for serious fans. F1TV grants access to all the zooming around you could want as well as to behind-the-scenes content like driver cams and live team radios. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/theres-a-dedicated-channel-for-formula-1-in-the-apple-tv-app-now-230904295.html?src=rss
