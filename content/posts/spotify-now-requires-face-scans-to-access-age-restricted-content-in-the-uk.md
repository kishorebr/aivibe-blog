<p>Spotify is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.spotify.com/uk/article/age-restricted-content-age-check/"><ins>introducing</ins></a> new requirements to confirm the ages of users in the UK trying to access explicit content. The streaming platform is implementing a facial scan process in partnership with Yoti, which also provides its services <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-testing-ai-face-scanning-tool-to-verify-your-age-114052186.html"><ins>to Instagram</ins></a>. UK Spotify users may be prompted to perform this age check when they try to view or listen to age-restricted content.</p>
<p>This type of approach to checking ages can sometimes yield wrong results. If the facial scan based on a photo of the user determines their age incorrectly, the person can instead provide an ID for verification. In addition to the limits on some explicit content, Spotify may use the results of these checks to deactivate an account if the user is below the minimum required age to be on the platform. In the UK, the minimum age for Spotify users is 13. &quot;If you cannot confirm youâ€™re old enough to use Spotify, your account will be deactivated and eventually deleted,&quot; the company said.</p>
