<p>Current and former members of the FDA told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/fda-ai-elsa-drug-regulation-makary"><em>CNN</em></a> about issues with the Elsa generative AI tool <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-fda-rolls-out-its-own-ai-to-speed-up-clinical-reviews-and-scientific-evaluations-120052323.html">unveiled</a> by the federal agency last month. Three employees said that in practice, Elsa has hallucinated nonexistent studies or misrepresented real research. &quot;Anything that you don&#39;t have time to double-check is unreliable,&quot; one source told the publication. &quot;It hallucinates confidently.&quot; Which isn&#39;t exactly ideal for a tool that&#39;s supposed to be speeding up the clinical review process and aiding with making efficient, informed decisions to benefit patients.</p>
<p>Leadership at the FDA appeared unfazed by the potential problems posed by Elsa. &quot;I have not heard those specific concerns,&quot; FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told <em>CNN</em>. He also emphasized that using Elsa and participating in the training to use it are currently voluntary at the agency.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>CNN</em> investigation highlighting these flaws with the FDA&#39;s artificial intelligence arrived on the same day as the White House introduced an &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/trumps-ai-action-plan-targets-state-regulation-and-ideological-bias-163247225.html">AI Action Plan</a>.&quot; The program presented AI development as a technological arms race that the US should win at all costs, and it laid out plans to remove &quot;red tape and onerous regulation&quot; in the sector. It also demanded that AI be free of &quot;ideological bias,&quot; or in other words, only following the biases of the current administration by removing mentions of climate change, misinformation, and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
