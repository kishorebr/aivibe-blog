<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html"><ins>AirPods Pro 3</ins></a> Apple introduced at the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html"><ins>iPhone 17 event</ins></a> yesterday have better active noise cancellation and foam-filled ear tips, but their most important new feature is a subtle one: Apple came up with even more reasons for you to never take them out.</p>
<p>Wearing headphones while you&#39;re talking to someone or interacting in public was at one point a social faux pas, but the ubiquity of AirPods and new features Apple has added have started to change that. The AirPods Pro&#39;s Conversation Awareness feature, which can automatically duck audio while you&#39;re talking to someone, is the simplest expression of this idea, but the vast majority of the improvements the company has made to its wireless earbuds have also created reasons to keep them in.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Take the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-pro-update-turns-them-into-a-clinical-grade-hearing-aid-174919818.html"><ins>hearing health features</ins></a> Apple debuted in 2024. Not only do they let your AirPods Pro act as a tool for checking your ear health, they can also act as a hearing aid and even hearing protection in a loud environment. With the AirPods Pro 3, you can add heart rate monitoring and live translation to the growing list of reasons to constantly wear AirPods. The Pro 3&#39;s new heart rate sensor means you can use them to track some workouts and display your health metrics on your TV during an Apple Fitness+ class, a feature usually exclusive to the Apple Watch. The Live Translation feature, meanwhile, lets your AirPods translate the world around you, and can even beam your translated voice into another pair of AirPods Pro 3. The fact the feature will also be <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-4-with-anc-and-airpods-pro-2-will-also-support-live-translation-184235997.html"><ins>available on AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2</ins></a> should make keeping your headphones in even more common, too.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to say how useful these new AirPods Pro 3 features will be without trying them, but they do highlight how much Apple seems to view its headphones as more than just an add-on purchase to every iPhone. Not many people are going to buy the $249 AirPods Pro 3 as a replacement for the $249 <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-has-an-s10-chip-and-always-on-display-173033538.html"><ins>Apple Watch SE 3</ins></a>, but the fact the headphones can fill in for the smartwatch could be attractive to some. More importantly for Apple, it could make it easier to convince someone to subscribe to Fitness+ or buy an Apple Watch if they like the company&#39;s approach to tracking workouts.</p>
<p>Apple has reportedly investigated going further down the path of making the AirPods Pro even more of a standalone device. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins></a>reported last year that the company has explored adding cameras to AirPods so they can be used for Apple Intelligence features and visually understand the world around you. Whether or not that ever happens, the more immediate explanation for all this feature-creep is that making AirPods an always-on wearable is good for the company&#39;s bottom line. The relationship between the AirPods and the Apple Watch could become similar to the iPad and the Mac in time. New features get added, and functionality continues to overlap, but the devices are always distinct and useful enough that many people are compelled to buy both.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#39;s a future where your AirPods feel as essential to daily life as a smartphone does, and we&#39;re wearing them all the time. For now though, Apple seems to have decided that tiptoeing towards that wearable future is a pretty good way to sell new wireless earbuds in the present, and maybe several of its other products in the process.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-is-slowly-morphing-airpods-into-an-always-on-wearable-203511552.html?src=rss
