<p>Data can paint a much starker contrast than words alone, and US Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) appears to get that. On Friday, her office <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-publishes-new-analysis-comparing-republican-tax-breaks-for-wealthy-to-investments-in-american-families" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">published</a> numbers on Big Tech&#39;s tax breaks in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-a-middle-finger-to-us-solar-energy-152042835.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Republicans&#39; &quot;Big Beautiful Bill.&quot;</a> When compared with the benefits those sums could have provided for working families, it helps to fortify what some might otherwise dismiss as run-of-the-mill rhetoric.</p><p>According to Sen. Warren, the bill&#39;s tax breaks for Microsoft alone will total $12.5 billion in 2026. When compared with the average cost of SNAP benefits, that sum could have provided food assistance to 5.2 million people. Or, it could have covered Medicaid for 1.6 million adults (or 3.8 million children), or lowered Affordable Care Act (ACA) premiums for 1.9 million Americans.</p><p>Meanwhile, Warren says Amazon is set to score a $16 billion tax break this year. That&#39;s the equivalent of Medicaid for 2 million adults (or 5.4 million children), lower ACA payments for 2.4 million Americans or SNAP benefits for 6.6 million people.</p><p>What about the tax breaks Alphabet gets? Warren says Google&#39;s parent company is looking at a $17.9 billion tax cut this year. That could pay for Medicaid for 2.3 million adults (or 5.4 million kids), lower ACA premiums for 2.8 million people or food assistance for 7.5 million people.</p><p>If you’re confused about why Big Tech is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/big-tech-is-helping-to-pay-for-trumps-ballroom-that-we-all-definitely-want-162545434.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">helping to pay for a lavish White House ballroom</a>, look no further. Regardless, Warren’s analysis goes on to break down the $137 billion in tax breaks for all corporations in 2026, the $132 billion routed to the wealthiest one percent in 2027 and more.
