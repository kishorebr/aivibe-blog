<p><em>Monument Valley 3</em> is finally coming to more platforms, after being a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/monument-valley-3-is-out-today-for-your-puzzling-pleasure-210407166.html">Netflix exclusive since December</a>. The game will be released on July 22 for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Remember, Switch games <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-launches-on-thursday-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-143310737.html?src=rss">are playable on Switch 2</a>, so it should also technically be available on Nintendo&#39;s new console.</p>
<p><em>Monument Valley 3</em> is considered a solid entry in the franchise, with plenty of fresh puzzles that play with perspective. You navigate a character through bizarre mazes and strangely-designed levels.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="71bb89494f944e6b97d9b9a4c4b12ae7"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?si=aj29H4HicFUcS-GG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>These games are partially inspired by artists like M.C. Escher, as the pathways don&#39;t necessarily follow the laws of physics. It&#39;s a whole lot of fun, and sort of plays like a more psychedelic version of the Switch exclusive <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-01-captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review-locked-and-toaded.html"><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third entry in the franchise brings in a new gameplay mechanic in the form of a sailboat that freely moves between sections. The vibes are top-tier, with gorgeous art and a great ambient soundtrack. We don&#39;t have a price yet, as <em>Monument Valley 3</em> was free with a Netflix subscription, but <em>Monument Valley 2</em> ranged from $5 to $8 depending on the platform.</p>
