<p>One of the games that really caught my eye during the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/live-updates-from-the-xbox-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-200036748.html">Xbox Games Showcase</a> at the beginning of June was <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a dark fantasy action-RPG from Rebel Wolves, the studio <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rebel-wolves-studio-from-witcher-3-director-155224972.html">co-founded by <em>Witcher 3</em> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</a>. First <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsyV7yQIBQ&amp;t=193s">teased earlier this year</a>, <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is a single-player open-world game set in a version of 14th-century Europe that&#39;s crawling with vampires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two trailers gave us a bit of a glimpse at what the gameplay will be like, but the developer has now shared an in-depth look in a 21-minute video, which you can watch below. It looks pretty sick â€” but keep in mind that this footage is from the &quot;pre-beta&quot; game, so there&#39;s still a lot of polishing to be done.</p>

<p>In <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, &quot;You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family.&quot; It&#39;s slated to hit PC, Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-developers-share-a-look-at-gameplay-from-the-upcoming-vampire-fantasy-rpg-185720914.html?src=rss
