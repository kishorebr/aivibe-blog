<p>Here&#39;s a bit of sad news for gamers. Hypixel Studios <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Noxywoxy/status/1937180229031940439"><ins>is shutting down</ins></a> and ending development of <em>Hytale</em>. The game looked pretty nifty, combining action-RPG mechanics with <em>Minecraft</em>. Riot Games <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-buys-hypixel-studios-hytale-171845047.html">purchased the developer</a> back in 2020, though it has been working on <em>Hytale</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14o3p7n/the_slow_development_of_hytale_a_timeline/"><ins>a lot longer than that</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Development is ending immediately and the company will be shutting down &quot;over the next few months.&quot; Hypixel CEO Aaron &quot;Noxy&quot; Donaghey said the decision was made when it &quot;became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale</em> to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising,&quot; he continued. &quot;Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that <em>Hytale</em> still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Donaghey doesn&#39;t blame Riot. He went on to say that the company behind <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> offered the staff &quot;generous severance&quot; and is helping impacted employees find new opportunities. We contacted Riot Games for a comment and will update this post if we hear back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a bummer. The game looked pretty darn cool and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFshRbtu8Ds"><ins>recent developer updates</ins></a> teased reworked biomes, improved graphics and a lot more. Now we&#39;ll never know what could have been.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html?src=rss
