<p>Nearly four years after the release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-preview-xbox-series-x-080130895.html"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a>, the sixth installment in the franchise has failed to live up to its name. Instead, the studio behind the sci-fi series may be working on a &quot;live service, long-term updating multiplayer&quot; Halo game that could do just that. According to YouTuber <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E">Rebs Gaming</a>, a source claimed that Halo Studios, previously known as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-itself-to-halo-studios-120041943.html">343 Industries</a>, is working on a multiplayer Halo title that could borrow <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s model of constantly pushing out content updates. The report also noted that there aren&#39;t any mentions of <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s battle royale style for the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While live service games are becoming the norm, veterans of the Halo franchise may not have much faith in Halo Studios after failing to deliver on <em>Halo: Infinite</em>&#39;s longevity. Back in March, another <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twistedvoxel.com/halo-infinite-scrapped-10-year-content-plan-revealed/">report</a> revealed that <em>Halo: Infinite</em> was meant to be supported with a 10-year plan of consistent updates, but this roadmap was scrapped following leadership issues and a switch to Unreal Engine. While <em>Halo: Infinite</em>&#39;s multiplayer mode has received notable updates since its initial release, the game still sits at a Mixed rating on Steam.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with this upcoming live service Halo title, the report claimed that the studio is working on a remake of the first game in the series, <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Unyshek/status/1978966083252937164">John Junyszek</a>, the senior community manager at Halo Studios, we could hear more about either project during the Halo World Championship that takes place from October 24 to 26.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-next-game-in-the-halo-franchise-could-be-live-service-multiplayer-171036206.html?src=rss
