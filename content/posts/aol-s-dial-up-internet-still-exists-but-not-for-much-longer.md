<p>It may have been decades since you last heard the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs">crunching screeches</a> of connecting with dial-up Internet, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued">AOL</a> said it will discontinue its dial-up service on September 30, officially marking the end of an era in Internet history. As first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/aol-discontinues-its-dial-up-internet-and-were-just-surprised-they-even-offered-it-in-2025/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>, AOL made the surprising announcement in a post buried in its AOL Help pages. Along with the dial-up service, AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser will also be discontinued by the end of September.</p>
<p>It may come as a shock to most that AOL still runs its dial-up Internet service, but some <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/aol-1point5-million-people-still-pay-for-service-but-not-for-dial-up-internet.html">thousands of users</a> still rely on this outdated method as an affordable way to access the Internet in more rural areas. However, these user numbers in the &quot;low thousands&quot; are a far cry from AOL&#39;s heyday, which reportedly saw tens of millions of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/aol-surpasses-20-million-members/">subscribers</a>, most likely thanks to the stacks of free trial CDs people would find in their mailboxes. Nowadays, dial-up Internet fails to compete against the likes of much faster broadband options, which include cable, fiber and satellite alternatives.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even though AOL&#39;s dial-up service eventually lost relevancy, it stuck around for 34 years before meeting the same fate as other &#39;90s tech icons like Blockbuster, Discmans and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/rip-aim-aol-instant-messenger-shutdown/">AOL Instant Messenger</a>. Now, the only time you&#39;ll really hear that iconic America Online serenade is through recreations on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/AdrianDittmann/status/1954530217029955704">social media</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/aols-dial-up-internet-still-exists-but-not-for-much-longer-193004233.html?src=rss
