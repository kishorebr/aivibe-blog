<p class="has-text-align-none">Switzerland <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-ai/switzerland-launches-transparent-chatgpt-alternative/89929269">launched</a> an open-source model called Apertus on Monday as an alternative to proprietary models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude, reports <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-ai/switzerland-launches-transparent-chatgpt-alternative/89929269"><em>SWI</em></a> as spotted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/switzerland-launches-its-own-open-source-ai-model-133051578.html">Engadget</a>. The model’s source code, training data, model weights, and detailed development process are <a href="https://huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus-8B-Instruct-2509">available</a> on the AI model platform HuggingFace.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apertus, which is Latin for “open,” was designed to “set a new baseline for trustworthy and globally relevant open models,” according to the <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ai/apertus-tech-report/blob/main/Apertus_Tech_Report.pdf">developers</a>. The model was trained on over 1,800 languages and comes in two sizes with either 8 billion or 70 billion parameters. Apertus is comparable to the 2024 Llama 3 model from Meta, according to <em>SWI</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The model was built to adhere to the European Union’s copyright laws and voluntary AI code of practice, which some US-based AI companies have said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715710/google-falls-in-line-with-the-eus-ai-plan">reluctantly signed</a> while claiming that the regulations will curb AI innovation and deployment. Apertus’ training data was restricted to public sources, while adhering to the AI crawler opt-out requests on certain websites, according to the <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ai/apertus-tech-report/blob/main/Apertus_Tech_Report.pdf">developers</a>.
