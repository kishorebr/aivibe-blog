<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">NASA is apparently giving its ice-scouting moon rover mission another try. The space agency has </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-to-deliver-viper-rover-to-moons-south-pole/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">announced</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> that the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) project — which was </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-scraps-its-viper-project-that-aimed-to-look-for-ice-on-the-moon-110005343.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">called off last year</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> after a series of delays and mounting costs — could catch a ride to the moon with Blue Origin in 2027 under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Blue Origin must first plan and demonstrate how the delivery at the lunar surface would work, and if it&#39;s all to NASA&#39;s liking, VIPER will be ferried by the company&#39;s Blue Moon Mark 1 lander.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Blue Origin hasn&#39;t yet attempted a moon landing, but the first opportunity for its Blue Moon Mark 1 lander is expected to launch later this year as part of another CLPS delivery. That mission will also help to inform NASA&#39;s decision about VIPER&#39;s rideshare, which would use a second Mark 1 lander that the agency says is already in production. If VIPER does eventually make it to the moon, it&#39;ll be deployed in the extreme environment of the lunar South Pole to search for water ice and other resources that could support future missions.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">“This delivery could show us where ice is most likely to be found and easiest to access, as a future resource for humans,” said Joel Kearns, Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration with NASA&#39;s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “And by studying these sources of lunar water, we also gain valuable insight into the distribution and origin of volatiles across the solar system, helping us better understand the processes that have shaped our space environment and how our inner solar system has evolved.”</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-resurrects-its-viper-moon-rover-for-a-2027-mission-with-blue-origin-211315035.html?src=rss
