<p>Fable, a startup designing tools to generate animated TV shows from scratch, is launching an AI-powered streaming service this week, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/netflix-of-ai-amazon-invests-fable-showrunner-launch-1236471989/"><em>Variety </em>reports</a>. The service is called Showrunner, and it will allow subscribers to generate scenes, view content created for Fable&#39;s in-house AI-generated animated shows and even insert themselves into the animations they generate.</p>
<p>Showrunner is launching in alpha, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.showrunner.xyz/">based on Fable&#39;s website</a>, you&#39;ll primarily interact with it through the company&#39;s Discord to start. Per <em>Variety, </em>subscribers will pay anywhere from $10 to $20 month for credits that can be exchanged for the ability to generate new animated scenes. The word &quot;scenes&quot; is key here. While Fable is launching with a couple of distinct animated shows, they&#39;re really more like collections of worlds and characters that subscribers can use to create new scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those include <em>Exit Valley</em>, a <em>Family Guy</em>-inspired riff on the culture of Silicon Valley, and <em>Everything is Fine, </em>a comedy about a husband and wife who are stranded in an alternate world and trying to reunite. The company&#39;s goal is bigger than than just original content. Fable founder Edward Saatchi<em>&nbsp;</em>imagines a Disney-owned &quot;Toy Story of AI&quot; where subscribers could generate endless new scenes of Buzz and Woody interacting. For now, though, interested Showrunner users have to settle with knockoffs.</p>
<p>Engadget was able to preview an earlier version of Fable&#39;s Showrunner AI models back in 2019 that capably <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-simulation-ai-put-me-in-a-south-park-episode-170002565.html">generated new <em>South Park</em> episodes</a> based on audio inputs. The startup&#39;s model was able to create a watchable copy of the show&#39;s style even back then, which might be why Amazon has invested an undisclosed amount in Fable as part of the launch of Showrunner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While creatives remain skeptical to downright antagonist towards AI, companies have started using it more publicly in production. For example, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-already-using-generative-ai-in-its-original-shows-201209502.html">Netflix recently touted</a> its use of generative AI in its original show <em>The Eternaut</em>. Even if adoption grows, though, that doesn&#39;t really clarify whether the average film or TV viewer has any desire to generate content on their own, especially if it&#39;s as rough-around-the-edges<em>&nbsp;</em>as most AI-generated media is. Besides being a public demonstration of Fable&#39;s tech, Showrunner seems like a test to see if that desire is even there.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/showrunner-an-ai-powered-streaming-service-launches-in-alpha-this-week-204042241.html?src=rss
