<p>Apple has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html">fallen far behind</a> in the competitive market of AI-powered chatbots, but it may have a plan for an in-house option that aligns with the company&#39;s &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/style/tim-cook-interview-apple-intelligence-vision-pro-48c59018">not first, but best</a>&quot; philosophy. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-03/apple-s-chatgpt-rival-from-new-answers-team-iphone-17-spotted-in-the-wild-mdvmqs6g"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple created a team called &quot;Answers, Knowledge and Information&quot; earlier this year that&#39;s tasked with developing a &quot;stripped-down rival to ChatGPT.&quot;</p>
<p>Forming this team represents a major change in direction from Apple&#39;s earlier stance on artificial intelligence when the company partnered with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">OpenAI</a> in 2024 to infuse Siri with ChatGPT instead of developing its own AI chatbot. Now, Gurman reported that this new Apple team will instead develop in-house AI services for a &quot;new ChatGPT-like search experience&quot; that can crawl the web to respond to questions. These new capabilities could be a standalone app, as well as support AI capabilities for Apple&#39;s Siri, Spotlight and Safari, according to Gurman&#39;s sources. The team is reportedly led by Robby Walker, who previously oversaw Siri, and has been advertising job openings that mention wanting experience with search algorithms and engine development.</p>

Earlier this year, the company said it would delay the release of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">new-and-improved Siri</a>, adding only that it would roll out &quot;in the coming year.&quot; However, Apple is aware of the need to accelerate its Apple Intelligence program to stay competitive. In the latest third-quarter earnings call, the company&#39;s CEO Tim Cook said that Apple is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-open-to-acquisitions-to-boost-its-ai-roadmap-221925560.html">open to acquisitions</a> to fast-track its AI roadmap.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html?src=rss
