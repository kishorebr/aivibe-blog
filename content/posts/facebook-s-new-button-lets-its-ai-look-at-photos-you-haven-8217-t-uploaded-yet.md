<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta has rolled out an opt-in AI feature to its US and Canadian Facebook users that claims to make their photos and videos more &#8220;shareworthy.&#8221; The only catch is that the feature is designed for your phone’s camera roll — <em>not </em>the media you’ve already uploaded to Facebook. If you opt in, Meta’s AI will comb through your camera roll, upload <em>your unpublished photos</em> to Meta’s cloud, and surface “hidden gems” that are “lost among screenshots, receipts, and random snaps,” the company says. Users will be able to save or share the suggested edits and collages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Facebook wanting to look at your unpublished photos sounds familiar, it might be because we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/694685/meta-ai-camera-roll">wrote about an early test in June</a>. At that time, the company claimed unposted, private photos were not being used to train Meta’s AI, but it declined to rule out whether it would do so in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, the future is now, and it sure sounds like Meta wants to train its AI on your photos — under certain conditions. In the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/new-facebook-feature-suggests-edits-and-collages-to-share/">Friday announcement</a> of the feature, Meta says, “We don’t use media from your camera roll to improve AI at Meta, unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Verge</em> asked Meta to confirm: Meta <em>will </em>use your camera roll to train its AI if you choose to use this feature, right? We also asked for clarification on <em>when</em> Meta begins using your unpublished photos to train its AI. Does it happen when you opt into the new feature? After you choose to edit something with the tool? Or only after you choose to share the resulting creation? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta spokesperson Mari Melguizo sent us the following clarification: “This means the camera roll media uploaded by this feature to make suggestions won’t be used to improve AI at Meta. Only if you edit the suggestions with our AI tools or publish those suggestions to Facebook, improvements to AI at Meta may be made.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Meta will collect and store your photos in the cloud and Meta’s AI will get to look at them, but the company won’t use them to train their AI unless you take an additional action — at least for now, according to Meta. Today, the feature says it will “select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis”; in June, Meta told us that it might hold onto some of that data for longer than 30 days. The company claims your media “won’t be used for ad targeting.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Meta acknowledged that it had already quietly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242789/meta-training-ai-models-facebook-instagram-photo-post-data">trained its AI models</a> on all public photos and text posted to Facebook and Instagram by adult users since 2007.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Facebook’s blog today shows that users will be asked if they want to “allow cloud processing to get creative ideas made for you from your camera roll.” It’s not yet clear if that prompt will also warn users that the feature may train Meta’s AI on your photos. The company says the feature is meant to help users who enjoy snapping pics but want to improve their photos before posting, or who don&#8217;t have time to “create something special.” Facebook says it’ll roll out the feature in the coming months.</p>
