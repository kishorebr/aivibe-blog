<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv9FMORDvjU">Unhinged</a> as Grok may be, it&#39;s now open source. xAI&#39;s CEO, Elon Musk, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2">posted on X</a> that the company made the older Grok 2.5 model available to the public and will do the same with the upcoming Grok 3. For now, anyone can download, run and even tweak Grok, whose source code was uploaded to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2">Hugging Face platform</a>. However, there are restrictions to xAI&#39;s open-source license, which doesn&#39;t let people use Grok to train, create or improve other AI models.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time xAI has made its models available to the public. In March 2024, the company released the raw base model of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-1">Grok-1</a>, which isn&#39;t finetuned for any specific task. As xAI continues to make Grok more accessible, it&#39;s a stark contrast to OpenAI, which has only offered less powerful models of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/technology/openai-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt.html">ChatGPT model</a> to researchers and businesses.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Making Grok open source allows independent developers to potentially improve on the AI model, but xAI is still trying to move past an extremely alarming episode of Grok providing antisemitic responses and referencing itself as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html">MechaHitler</a>. The Grok team attributed the incident to &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-team-apologizes-for-the-chatbots-horrific-behavior-and-blames-mechahitler-on-a-bad-update-184520189.html">deprecated code</a>&quot; that has since been fixed. As for Grok 3, Musk also said on X that it will also go open source in six months, but we may have to take that estimated release with a grain of salt, considering the CEO&#39;s other <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_predictions_for_autonomous_Tesla_vehicles_by_Elon_Musk">promised timelines</a>.</p>
