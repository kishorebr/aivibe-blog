It’s been a whirlwind year for the vibe-coding world’s database of choice: Supabase. On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel.

And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.


	
	




	
	



So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.

Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.

Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts — like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code, it says.

Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company sai
