<p>Meta seems to be working on ways for Threads users to share long-form writing within a single post. Several users have <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@rpn/post/DN5mMqkgJ-s">reported</a> seeing a new &quot;attach text&quot; feature on the service, which allows them to embed large chunks of text within a single post.</p>
<p>The feature, which hasn&#39;t been formally announced by Meta, is similar to the &quot;articles&quot; feature that&#39;s available <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-write-long-form-articles-on-x-if-you-pay-for-premium-005707599.html"><ins>on X</ins></a> to Premium+ subscribers. It enables Threads users to embed longer text excerpts within a single Threads post and offers some basic formatting options. &quot;Attach longer text and get creative with styling tools to share deeper thoughts, news snippets, book excerpts and more,&quot; Meta explains in a screenshot <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@justinmixon2/post/DN33TzLEdFo?xmt=AQF0wrRZ8aNJcqxOWNhn2KJKg5IiK9_GX8DjMLhlrRH66g"><ins>shared by</ins></a>Threads user Justin Mixon.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though the feature hasn&#39;t been rolled out widely yet, it appears that anyone can view these longer text snippets that have already been shared. On mobile, these attachments open into a full-screen view that makes it easy to scroll through the text. On <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://threads.com/"><ins>threads.com</ins></a>, text appears in a dedicated window. (Here are <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@rpn/post/DN5wP4GgOm7"><ins>a couple</ins></a> examples <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@rpn/post/DN5qeu8gKgt"><ins>shared by</ins></a> Threads user Roberto Nickson.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not clear what Meta&#39;s plans are for the feature. Engadget confirmed the company is currently testing the ability to share long-form text, but it&#39;s not clear when it might be more widely available. The ability to embed long-form writing directly on Threads could open up new possibilities for creators, publishers and others who want to move beyond the service&#39;s 500-character limit.</p>
<p>Engadget&#39;s reporting has found that the vast majority of Threads users <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-users-still-barely-click-links-170139103.html"><ins>don&#39;t click on links</ins></a> in posts, so giving users more flexibility within Threads itself could be helpful. At the same time, it risks making the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-up-to-400-million-monthly-active-users-190203754.html"><ins>400-million</ins></a> user service even more insular. It&#39;s also worth noting that screenshots currently indicate posts with text attachments aren&#39;t able to be shared to services within the fediverse, which could potentially undermine Meta&#39;s goal to be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-previews-fediverse-sharing-for-threads-001632698.html"><ins>interoperable</ins></a> with other ActivityPub-enabled platforms like Mastodon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-experimenting-with-long-form-text-on-threads-175557130.html?src=rss
