At the top of the list this year? AI agents.The report comes at a time when tech companies are making big promises about AI's capabilities and the extent to which it will become entrenched in our everyday lives, both at home and work. Gartner named four main technologies: agents, AI-ready data, multimodal AI, and what it called "AI trust, risk and security management (TRiSM)." Let's break down what it says about each one. AI agents and AI-ready data AI agents refer to increasingly autonomous systems that can carry out tasks for humans, ideally with little to no intervention. However, at their simplest, they can function like standard chatbots or assistants; "agent" remains a pretty widely defined word, meaning what agents actually do varies significantly in terms of sophistication and application. Also: AI agents will be ambient, but not autonomous - what that means for usAI is only as good as the data it has access to. AI-ready data is information that is correctly structured to be ingested by AI tools, meaning it's been optimized for efficiency and accuracy. Unlike the other three technologies Gartner's report focused on, the firm
