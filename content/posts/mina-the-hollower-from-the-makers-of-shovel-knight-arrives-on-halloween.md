<p>It&#39;s been a few years since Yacht Club Games, the studio behind Shovel Knight, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/shovel-knight-developer-mina-the-hollower-041336393.html">ran a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> for the first entry in a new franchise, and now we know when that game will drop. The team announced at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-summer-game-fests-kickoff-stream-here-at-5pm-et-193047477.html">Summer Game Fest Live</a> that <em>Mina the Hollower </em>will arrive on October 31 on PC. A demo is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3741460/Mina_the_Hollower_Demo/">available on Steam</a> until Steam Next Fest ends on June 13.</p>
<p><em>Mina the Hollower </em>is a gothic horror-influenced, action-adventure platformer, so the Halloween release date is quite fitting. It&#39;s styled after the look and feel of Game Boy Color games â€” so much so that the game has no 3D assets and a limited color palette (but Yacht Club did make one concession by opting for a widescreen display ratio). As the inventor and mouse Mina, you&#39;ll have a whip as a weapon and the ability to burrow short distances to cross gaps and have a moment of invincibility.</p>
