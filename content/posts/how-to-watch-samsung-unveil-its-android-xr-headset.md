<p>Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-introduce-its-android-xr-headset-at-a-galaxy-event-on-october-21-230000605.html">is set to officially reveal</a> its long-anticipated Android extended reality (XR) headset, which has been codenamed Project Moohan. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-galaxy-event-worlds-wide-open-a-new-era-of-multimodal-ai">has scheduled a livestream event</a> for October 21 at 10PM ET.</p>
<p>The event will be streamed live via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">company&#39;s YouTube page</a> and on the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">official Samsung Newsroom site</a>. We don&#39;t know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the &quot;true potential&quot; of mixed-reality devices.</p>

We&#39;ll finally get to see what all the fuss is about and what kind of new tools the OS brings to the table.</p>
<p>Samsung says that this technology &quot;seamlessly blends everyday utility with immersive new experiences.&quot; Hopefully we&#39;ll get a look at both everyday utility and immersive new experiences during the livestream.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">plenty of leaks and rumors</a> that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream.
