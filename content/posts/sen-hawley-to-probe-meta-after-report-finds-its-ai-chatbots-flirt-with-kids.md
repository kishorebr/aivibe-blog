Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he intends to investigate whether Meta’s generative AI products exploit, deceive, or harm children, after leaked internal documents showed the company’s chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children. 

“Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote in a post on X announcing the investigation.


	
	




	
	



Hawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he says will commence a probe into whether Meta’s tech harms children, and “whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards.”

Reuters broke the story after viewing the guidelines, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards.” The document noted, among other things, that chatbots were permitted to hold romantic conversations with an 8-year-old that said, “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” 

A Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch that such examples are inconsistent with Meta’s policies and have since been removed. 

“It’s unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place,” Hawley wrote in a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that Meta acknowledged the veracity of the reports and “made retractions only after this alarming content came to light.”

“We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward,” Hawley wrote.
