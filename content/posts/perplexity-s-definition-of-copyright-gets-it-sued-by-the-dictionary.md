<p>Merriam-Webster and its parent company Encyclopedia Britannica are the latest to take on AI in court. The plaintiffs have <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/encyclopedia-britannica-sues-perplexity-over-ai-answer-engine-2025-09-11/">sued</a> Perplexity, claiming that AI company&#39;s &quot;answer engine&quot; product unlawfully copies their copyrighted materials. They are also alleging copyright infringement for instances where Perplexity&#39;s AI creates false or inaccurate hallucinations that it then wrongly attributes to Britannica or Merriam-Webster. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbvgzdndwpq/PERPLEXITY%20AI%20COPYRIGHT%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf"><ins>complaint</ins></a>, filed in New York federal court, is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an order that blocks Perplexity from misusing their content.</p>
<p>&quot;Perplexity&#39;s so-called &quot;answer engine&quot; eliminates users&#39; clicks on Plaintiffs&#39; and other web publishers&#39; websites—and, in turn, starves web publishers of revenue—by generating responses to users&#39; queries that substitute the content from other information websites,&quot; the filing reads. &quot;To build its substitute product, Perplexity engages in massive copying of Plaintiffs&#39; and other web publishers’ protected content without authorization or remuneration.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t Perplexity&#39;s first time facing allegations that it has unlawfully taken another website&#39;s content. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/wall-street-journal-and-new-york-post-are-suing-perplexity-ai-for-copyright-infringement-050135219.html"><ins>Last year</ins></a>, the AI company was accused of copyright infringement by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>New York Post</em>.
