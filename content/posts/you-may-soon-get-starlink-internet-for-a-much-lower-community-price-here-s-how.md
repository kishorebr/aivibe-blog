"Starlink is launching a new affordable way to deliver high-speed internet," the post reads, "one Starlink, multiple subscribers -- each with their own Starlink account and seamless experience."At present, every Starlink subscriber needs their own dish. A connection can be shared across multiple devices in the home, but not across multiple households. The Community program appears to let multiple users across different routers connect to the same dish -- think apartment or condo complexes. This lowers the price of a monthly subscription for every user and the initial hardware setup cost as well.SpaceX has since removed the details, and the page leads to a 404 error, but PC Mag was able to catch the earlier version. There's also a dedicated Community page on the Starlink site, but it's not live yet. Accord
