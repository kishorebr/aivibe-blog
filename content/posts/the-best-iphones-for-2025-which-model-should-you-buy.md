<p>“Which iPhone should I buy?” It’s a question you may have heard many times over the years. Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you’re happy with your current iPhone, there’s no need to make a change at all. But if you’re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We’ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever made, including all five models Apple has released in 2025. Below, we’ve broken down which ones may best suit your needs.<br><br>Before we dig in, just note that we’ve based our guide on the list prices of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a steep discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could change the value equation.</p>

The 16 Plus and its 6.7-inch display might be worth it if you want a large-screen iPhone for a much lower price than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but you’ll miss out on the base model’s 120Hz always-on display and upgraded dual-camera setup. If you just want a usable iPhone for as little as possible, meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is acceptable for $100 less. In general, we think the iPhone 17 is worth the extra $100; its 6.3-inch display helps it split the difference between the 16 and 16 Plus anyway.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-buy-an-iphone">When is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?</h3> 
<p>The best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone#Models">almost always</a> introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases.</p> 
<p>Cash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-phones-are-on-sale-for-record-low-prices-170952808.html">Samsung</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/googles-pixel-9-pro-is-200-off-plus-the-rest-of-the-weeks-best-tech-deals-180041864.html">Google</a> phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-does-an-iphone-last">How long does an iPhone last?</h3> 
<p>This depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement">battery replacement</a> sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).</p> 
<p>Software support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-is-ready-to-download-everything-to-know-about-the-free-iphone-software-update-135749287.html">iOS 26 update</a> is available on iPhones <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-26-iphe3fa5df43/ios">dating back to 2019</a>. Most of those older phones <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115">don’t support</a> Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t <em>total</em> parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-how-old-my-iphone-is">How do I know how old my iPhone is?</h3> 
<p>Go to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General &gt; About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108044">Apple’s identification page</a> to further confirm.</p> 
<p>If you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106343">printed within</a> its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-recent-updates">Recent updates</h2> 
<p><strong>September 2025</strong>: We’ve overhauled this guide to reflect the release of the new iPhone Air and iPhone 17 series. The base iPhone 17 is our new top pick for most people, while the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max represent the best iPhones you can buy if money is no object. The iPhone Air is worth considering if you care about style above all else, while the iPhone 16e remains acceptable if you want the most affordable new iPhone possible.</p> 
<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: We’ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.</p> 
<p><strong>June 2025</strong>: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs. Our picks remain unchanged.</p> 
<p><strong>February 2025</strong>: The new iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as our “budget” pick. We’ve also removed our notes on the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation), as each has been formally discontinued.</p> 
<p><strong>January 2025</strong>: We've made a few minor edits for clarity and ensured our recommendations are still up to date.</p>
