<p>LG is teaming up with Dolby for a new collection of speakers that the companies are unveiling ahead of CES 2026. The LG Sound Suite features a modular lineup the H7 soundbar, M7 and M5 wireless surround speakers and the W7 subwoofer. The speakers can be combined in more than two dozen different configurations, from a pair to a full 13.1.7 channel surround sound home theater setup.</p><p>The main pitch of the LG Sound Suite is its application of Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. This is the audio brand&#39;s tech for optimizing sound from wherever wireless speakers are placed. It&#39;s meant to deliver optimal sound even from unusual locations, even when you&#39;re limited by outlet locations, furniture placement or other quirks of a room&#39;s layout. The collaboration with LG brings FlexConnect to a soundbar for the first time. When the H7 soundbar is used as the lead device, the suite will bring Dolby Atmos FlexConnect audio to any television. In a future software update, LG will also bring support for Dolby Atmos FlexConnect directly to some of its premium TVs, including select 2025 models.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html?src=rss
