In to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/romerogames.bsky.social/post/3ltfjxsyavs23"><ins>post</ins></a> on Bluesky, the company clarified that its latest project is currently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-was-funding-romero-games-new-game-but-layoffs-have-left-the-project-in-crisis-172234905.html">canceled</a> after its funding was pulled.

It may eventually find new life with a new backer. "We've been contacted by several publishers interested in helping us bring the game across the finish line, and we're currently evaluating those opportunities," the company said.</p>
