    Harvard's new free AI tool could help treat Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and even cancer
     
    AI can do more than just write your essays - a new model is advancing drug discovery for hard-to-treat diseases.

Microsoft's tool is 4 times better for complex casesLast week, Harvard Medical School published a study on a new AI model called PDGrapher. According to Harvard, the model can analyze the connections between genes, proteins, and signaling pathways inside cells to identify the best combination of therapies that would effectively restore healthy cell behavior. This could enable new treatments for conditions that have previously been unable to be found via traditional methods.The findings In a summary of the study, which was partially federally funded, the authors explain that usual drug discovery approaches tackle one protein at a time, and work in cases such as kinase inhibitors -- drugs that prevent cancer cells from expanding by blocking certain proteins -- but can fall short when the disease involves interactions between multiple signaling pathways and genes."Traditional drug discovery resembles tasting hundreds of prepared dishes to find one that happens to taste perfect," said study senior author Marinka Zitnik in the summary. "PDGrapher works like a master chef
