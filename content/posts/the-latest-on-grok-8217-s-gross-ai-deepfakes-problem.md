<p class="has-text-align-none">The launch of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/853191/grok-explicit-bikini-pictures-minors" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/news/853191/grok-explicit-bikini-pictures-minors">AI image editing feature</a> on xAI&#8217;s Grok has caused chaos on X after it was used to generate a flood of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes. As Hayden Field <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">wrote</a>, “screenshots show Grok complying with requests to put real women in lingerie and make them spread their legs, and to put small children in bikinis.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859107/uk-prime-minister-x-ai-grok-deepfakes">called the deepfakes “disgusting,”</a> saying, “X need[s] to get their act together and get this material down. And we will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.” X has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting">slightly restricted the feature</a> by requiring a paid subscription to generate images by tagging Grok on X, but the AI image editor remains freely available otherwise. </p>
