<p>The Unicode Consortium <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.unicode.org/2025/07/say-hello-to-new-emoji-coming-in.html">has announced</a> that it's adding what's essentially a Bigfoot emoji to the open Unicode standard this fall. The famous cryptid will appear as "Hairy Creature" alongside a selection of other fun new emoji options in Unicode 17.0.</p>
<p>It might seem strange that a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://home.unicode.org/membership/members/">consortium of companies</a> as powerful as Apple, Google and Microsoft would practically subtweet one of North America's most famous semi-mythological creatures. But the global nature of Unicode makes avoiding region-specific nomenclature preferable whenever possible. To me, that's Bigfoot, plain and simple, but elsewhere in the world it might scan as a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yowie">yowie</a>, yeti, nuk-luk, hibagon, orang pendekor or an almas.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides "Hairy Creature," here's some of the other new emoji getting added with Unicode 17.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trombone</p></li>
<li><p>Treasure Chest</p></li>
<li><p>Distorted Face</p></li>
<li><p>Fight Cloud</p></li>
<li><p>Apple Core</p></li>
<li><p>Orca</p></li>
<li><p>Ballet Dancers</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unicode 17.0 is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/beta-17.0.0.html">slated to be released</a> on September 9, 2025, but these new emoji likely won't be added to Android and iOS until a bit after the standard is updated.
