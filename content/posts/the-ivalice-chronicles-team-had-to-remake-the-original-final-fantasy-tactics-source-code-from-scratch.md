<p>The Square Enix team behind <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/final-fantasy-tactics-is-getting-a-remake-in-the-ivalice-chronicles-215000718.html"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics — The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> didn&#39;t just remaster the iconic strategy RPG, they had to go through the trouble of remaking the source code from scratch, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/remastering-final-fantasy-tactics-was-much-harder-than-it-seemed"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. In an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Jason Schreier, the game&#39;s director Kazutoyo Maehiro explained the arduous process of designing <em>The Ivalice Chronicles, </em>which is set to release at the end of the month.</p>
<p>When getting to work on the remake, Maehiro and his team discovered they had to rebuild the source code from the ground up since it was lost thanks to the industry&#39;s unstandardized practices in the &#39;90s, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. When translating <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> from Japanese to English for the global release, the company would overwrite the original Japanese version&#39;s code. For Maehiro, that meant the team had to undertake a ground-up overhaul and recreate the source code by playing the original game that released in 1997, consulting the game&#39;s master disc and looking at the 2011 version called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-available-today.html"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</em></a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Maehiro also said during a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/after-final-fantasy-tactics-source-code-was-lost-the-remasters-devs-looked-at-fan-made-websites-preservation-efforts-we-know-you-guys-do-such-a-good-job-of-keeping-all-of-that-up-to-date/">PAX West 2025 panel</a> that the team gleaned a lot of lost info from fan-made databases.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Revealing more of the behind-the-scenes decisions for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, Maehiro told <em>Bloomberg</em> about the debate surrounding Count Cidolfus Orlandeau. Better known as Cid, and appropriately nicknamed Thunder God Cid, this overtuned character joins you later in the game, but many fans complained about him being overpowered. Instead of nerfing Cid, Maehiro told <em>Bloomberg</em> that keeping this character&#39;s power level the same would better represent the storyline since &quot;his role in the story is being that very powerful character who joins your party.&quot; To quell any concerns of Cid being too broken, Maehiro told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the team decided to buff the other characters to even things out. Looking ahead, Maehiro also hinted at exploring sequels for the Final Fantasy Tactics franchise or even brand new games in the strategy RPG genre, given that <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> does well, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ivalice-chronicles-team-had-to-remake-the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-source-code-from-scratch-190253342.html?src=rss
