<p>Disney has demanded that Character.AI stop using its copyrighted characters. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/30/disney-characterai-cease-desist"><em><ins>Axios</ins></em></a> reports that the entertainment juggernaut sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, claiming that it has chatbots based on its franchises, including Pixar films, Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In addition to claiming copyright infringement, the letter questioned whether these protected characters were being used in problematic ways in conversations with underage users.</p>
<p>&quot;Character.ai&#39;s infringing chatbots are known, in some cases, to be sexually exploitive and otherwise harmful and dangerous to children, offending Disney&#39;s consumers and extraordinarily damaging Disney&#39;s reputation and goodwill,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Character.AI has been subject to legal and government scrutiny multiple times already over concerns that it has not provided sufficient safety guards for minors. The platform has been <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html"><ins>implicated</ins></a> in failing to protect two different teenagers who discussed suicide with its chatbots and then took their own lives. It has also drawn the attention of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-ftc-is-investigating-companies-that-make-ai-companion-chatbots-181413615.html"><ins>Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/us-attorneys-general-tell-ai-companies-they-will-be-held-accountable-for-child-safety-failures-035213253.html"><ins>US Attorneys General</ins></a>.</p>
<p>For now, at least, the platform appears to be responsive to Disney&#39;s demands. &quot;It&#39;s always up to rightsholders to decide how people may interact with their IP, and we respond swiftly to requests to remove content that rightsholders report to us,&quot; a representative said, per the <em>Axios</em> report. &quot;These characters have been removed.&quot;</p>
<p>Disney has shown that it is willing to take legal action against AI companies.
