ZDNET's key takeaways  WhisperPair vulnerabilities impact a protocol for connecting devices and audio products.Attackers can take over an audio device, tamper with controls, and potentially listen to your conversations.Many vendors have released patches, but some devices are still vulnerableResearchers have disclosed WhisperPair, a family of vulnerabilities that impact a protocol commonly used to pair headphones, earbuds, and other audio products with Bluetooth devices.

As first reported by Wired, WhisperPair was uncovered by a team of researchers from Belgium's KU Leuven University, supported by the government's Cybersecurity Research Program.   The findings relate to the improper implementation of Google's Fast Pair protocol, which enables one-tap pairing and account synchronization across Bluetooth accessories. If the protocol hasn't been implemented correctly, a security flaw is introduced that "allows an attacker to hijack devices and track victims using Google's Find Hub network," according to the researchers.  Also: How this one-click Copilot attack bypassed security controls - and what Microsoft did about itThe vulnerability research was reported to Google privately in August 2025 and was issued a critical rating under CVE-2025-36911. A 150-day disclosure window was agreed and a bug bounty of $15,000 was awarded.     How does WhisperPair work?  WhisperPair occurs because many audio a
