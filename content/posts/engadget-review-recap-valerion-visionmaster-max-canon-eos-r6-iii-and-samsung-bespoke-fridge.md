<p>Our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reviews team</a> is rested up after the CES grind and we’re back to business. This week we reviewed the latest devices from Valerion, Canon, Samsung and Sony, covering a wide range of product categories in the process. Grab yourself a beverage and cozy up with all the reviews you might’ve missed. </p>

<p>The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are a popular time to upgrade home theater setups before the big game. One way to do that is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/valerion-visionmaster-max-projector-review-near-perfect-image-quality-comes-at-a-price-140045939.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Valerion’s VisionMaster Max</a> — if you’re willing to splurge. “The Valerion VisionMaster Max is a highly capable indoor projector that offers the best image quality I’ve seen thanks to the dynamic iris and Enhanced Black Level features,” contributing reporter Steve Dent discovered. “However, it’s also a lot more expensive than rival models at $5,000. It’s pretty hard to justify that extra money, unless you’re really fussy about picture accuracy and gaming performance, or need other features like the 1Gbps ethernet port.”</p>

<p>If you’re primarily shooting video these days, contributing reporter Steve Dent just wrapped up testing with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-eos-r6-iii-review-a-video-powerhouse-thats-also-great-for-photography-153000494.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Canon EOS R6 III</a>. While he said it’s great for video, the photo quality isn’t the absolute best you can get right now. “If it’s mainly photography you’re interested in, though, Sony’s $2,900 A7 V is a better choice,” he said. “It matches the R6 III’s resolution, price and autofocus but offers superior dynamic range and lower rolling shutter distortion.”</p>

<p>We don’t often review appliances here at Engadget, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsung-bespoke-fridge-with-ai-review-all-the-bells-and-whistles-140000099.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung’s AI-infused refrigerator</a> caught the attention of senior reporter Sam Rutherford. You may not think you need a 32-inch display in your kitchen or cameras in your fridge, but Sam argues once you try them you may never go back. “You may not agree or want to pay this much for features like this just yet, but Samsung&#39;s Bespoke AI 4-Door French Door refrigerator has convinced me there&#39;s a happy home for smarter iceboxes,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Clip-on earbuds have been constantly popping up over the last few years. Many of the key players in headphones have tried their hand at the open-wear form factor with Sony being the latest to jump on board. While the company embraces the inherent perks of these designs, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-linkbuds-clip-review-open-fit-benefits-arent-enough-to-stand-out-160000140.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">LinkBuds Clip</a> doesn’t do enough to rise above the competition. “Subpar bass performance and the omission of some of Sony’s more attractive features (and even some basic ones) mean the company hasn’t done enough to distinguish the Clip from the competition in an obvious way,” I wrote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-valerion-visionmaster-max-canon-eos-r6-iii-and-samsung-bespoke-fridge-123000849.html?src=rss
