<p>The hardest choice to make for building your next MacBook might be selecting a color. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple has tested colors including light yellow, light green, blue and pink for its next entry-level MacBook that&#39;s aimed at students and enterprise users.</p>
<p>Beyond the more vibrant colors, Gurman said that Apple has also trialed its classic silver and dark gray colorways for its cheaper laptop. Gurman added that not all of these six colors will make it to the final product, but Apple has recently shown it&#39;s not afraid to dip into flashier options. Apple refreshed the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-m4-imac-review-the-best-all-in-one-gets-a-lot-faster-173055294.html">iMac</a> in 2024 with a total of seven colors and swapped out the space gray option for sky blue for the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html">MacBook Air</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Color choices aside, the latest rumors point to the upcoming MacBook having a price tag that&#39;s anywhere between $699 and $799. To achieve that lower price point, Apple is expected to port over its chips designed for iPhones, like the A18 Pro that we first saw with the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. We&#39;re also anticipating Apple will compromise on specs, ports, or even the display, but Gurman reported that the company won&#39;t be skimping when it comes to the shell. According to Gurman, Apple will employ a new manufacturing process to craft aluminum shells for the affordable MacBook, instead of opting for a cheaper material like plastic to cut costs. We may not have to wait long to see the official colors of the budget MacBook, as Gurman reported that it will be announced during an event in March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-may-be-adding-a-splash-of-color-to-its-upcoming-budget-friendly-macbook-192740002.html?src=rss
