Enter the Bee AI wearable. On Wednesday, Bee CEO Maria de Lourdes announced via LinkedIn that Bee is joining Amazon. The concept behind Bee is simple: a $49 wristband equipped with mics and AI that is worn at all times to listen in on your everyday interactions, transcribe them, and provide additional insights like conversational search, action recommendations, and more. Also: Meta Ray-Bans vs. Oakley: I tested both smart glasses, there's a clear winnerThe details of the deal were not disclosed.

While at first, the product may sound invasive and superfluous, at CES 2025, I wore and demoed the wristband, and the real-world applications of the product became evident. Using audio, the wristband captures conversations all day unless manually paused with the button on it. It then gets to know you and provides AI summaries of your conversations, transcripts -- which you can parse using a chat
