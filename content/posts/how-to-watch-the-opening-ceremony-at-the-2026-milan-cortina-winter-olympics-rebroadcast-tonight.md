<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/">2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics</a> Opening Ceremony has concluded. The festivities featured performances from Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli, 3,000 athletes walking in the Parade of Nations, and not one but<em> two</em> Olympic cauldrons being lit. (One at Milan&#39;s Arco della Pace, since Milan is serving as the main hub for this year&#39;s Games, and the other in the Alpine city of Cortina d’Ampezzo, where events like skiing are taking place.) If you missed out on watching live, the Opening Ceremony will re-air in primetime tonight on NBC. Here&#39;s what you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
