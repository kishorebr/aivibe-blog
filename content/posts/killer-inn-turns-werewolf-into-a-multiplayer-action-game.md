<p><em>Killer Inn</em> is a little bit murder mystery and a little bit third-person action game, and combined, it looks like a lot of fun. Square Enix and developer Tactic Studios revealed <em>Killer Inn</em> during today&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/gaming/watch-summer-game-fests-kickoff-stream-here-at-5pm-et-193047477.html">Summer Game Fest kickoff</a> stream. A beta for the game is coming to Steam soon and it&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/">available to wishlist</a> now.</p>
<p><em>Killer Inn</em> is a lot like the movie <em>Clue</em>, or the TV show <em>The Traitors</em>, or the social improv game <em>Werewolf</em>, or the video game <em>Spy Party</em> — it&#39;s all about uncovering players&#39; true intentions and concealing your own, with a murderous twist. Each round includes 24 players, some of whom are wolves, while the rest are lambs. As a lamb, the players&#39; goal is sniff out the wolves and survive their attacks, and the wolves are out to blend in with the herd, stealthily killing when they can. Each kill leaves behind a clue for other players to find. The game ends when one team has eliminated all members of the opposing group.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t pure social strategy — there are various weapons, traps, poisons, bits of armor and masks to use, and a range of characters to choose from. <em>Killer Inn</em> is playable solo or with up to four players.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/killer-inn-turns-werewolf-into-a-multiplayer-action-game-220859571.html?src=rss
