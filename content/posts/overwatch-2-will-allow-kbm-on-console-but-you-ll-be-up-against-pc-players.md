<p><em>Overwatch 2</em> console players will officially be able to use a keyboard and mouse starting with the release of Season 18. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-2-retail-patch-notes-%E2%80%93-august-26-2025/977669"><ins>patch notes</ins></a> posted ahead of the new season, the <em>Overwatch 2</em> team says matchmaking pools will be tweaked slightly so players are sorted into a Mouse and Keyboard Pool and a Controller Pool. Those playing on a console using keyboard and mouse (KBM) inputs will be paired with PC players and other KBM console players, while the Controller Pool will be reserved only for console players using a controller. Season 18 arrives on August 26.</p>
<p>For players who switch to the Mouse and Keyboard Pool, &quot;your internal MMR, skill ratings and ranks for all game modes will be separate from your statistics in the Controller Pool,&quot; according to the patch notes. This group won&#39;t have access to aim assist, as has been the case and will continue to be for PC players using a controller. KBM players will have to accept the prompt to switch to that pool in order to play, or manually switch in the Gameplay Options menu.</p>
