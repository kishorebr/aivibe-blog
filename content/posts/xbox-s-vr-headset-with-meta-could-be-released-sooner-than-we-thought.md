<p>Xbox has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a chunky console. It's recently taken on the form of an Asus <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-will-be-released-during-the-2025-holiday-season-142135533.html">gaming handheld</a>, and it might even be packaged as a VR headset soon. According to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1936165435164045812">image leaked on X</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamesandwich.com/news/source-meta-will-announce-an-xbox-quest-3s-next-week/"><em>Game Sandwich</em></a>, Xbox is reportedly teaming up with Meta to release an Xbox-branded Quest 3S headset in the coming days. The rumored specs show a very similar build to the base model Quest 3S with 128GB of storage, but will reportedly be bundled with an Xbox wireless controller, a Meta Quest Elite strap and three months of Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>There's been no official announcement from Xbox or Meta yet, but a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d8bc74ad-0e5c-4673-afe6-831c8819220a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=blog+post&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL21ldGEtaG9yaXpvbi1vcy1vcGVuLWhhcmR3YXJlLWVjb3N5c3RlbS1hc3VzLXJlcHVibGljLWdhbWVycy1sZW5vdm8teGJveC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ4YmM3NGFkLTBlNWMtNDY3My1hZmU2LTgzMWM4ODE5MjIwYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0YS5jb20vYmxvZy9tZXRhLWhvcml6b24tb3Mtb3Blbi1oYXJkd2FyZS1lY29zeXN0ZW0tYXN1cy1yZXB1YmxpYy1nYW1lcnMtbGVub3ZvLXhib3gvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfl35uSquhqqnnWOjrVoqy2FvKEcmusZmAwySosB5WUw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fmeta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/">blog post</a> from 2024 noted that the two companies were working together to "create a limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox." While it's important to take this rumor with a grain of salt, Xbox <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-amd-partnership-sheds-light-on-the-future-of-the-divisions-ecosystem-200940253.html">seems interested</a> in opening up its hardware for collaboration with other companies, as indicated by the recent release of the ROG Xbox Ally.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the rumored Xbox version of the Meta Quest 3S, those who already own the base model headset might not be the target demographic since you can already run <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-lands-on-meta-quest-headsets-204929253.html">Xbox Game Pass</a> on it. Instead, this VR headset could be marketed as a convincing entry point for anyone looking to get into VR and is already familiar with the Xbox ecosystem. According to <em>Game Sandwich</em>'s sources, this Xbox-branded VR headset will cost $399 and is set to drop on June 24.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-vr-headset-with-meta-could-release-sooner-than-we-thought-180512994.html?src=rss
