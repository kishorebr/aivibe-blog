<p>A decade ago, when smart speakers with built-in voice assistants were the hot new thing, many imagined they&#39;d quickly evolve into highly intelligent companions. (Think C-3PO or Star Trek&#39;s Data living inside a speaker.) That road has been much longer than expected, as virtual helpers like Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant seemed to sit in neutral for years.</p>
<p>But now that generative AI is here (for better or worse), smart speakers are finally scratching the surface of those expectations. Google&#39;s new version, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-the-official-replacement-for-google-assistant-on-smart-devices-130041482.html">Gemini for Home</a>, is now available to try. Here&#39;s how.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>First, keep in mind that the Gemini for Home voice assistant is in early access. This means Google is gathering feedback about its features, and — as with all generative AI — it&#39;s wise to assume <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/advanced-ai-chatbots-are-less-likely-to-admit-they-dont-have-all-the-answers-172012958.html">it will make mistakes</a>. If or when it does, you can send feedback to Google in the Google Home app or by saying, &quot;Hey Google, send feedback.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also want to check your speaker model before diving in. The full Gemini for Home experience is available to try on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Google Nest Hub (2nd gen)</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-audio-smart-speaker-preview-120028799.html">Google Nest Audio</a>, Google Nest Mini (2nd gen) and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Google Nest Hub Max</a>. Those models all support Gemini Live, which enables <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/with-gemini-live-google-wants-you-to-relax-and-have-a-natural-chat-with-ai-181329788.html">conversational back-and-forth chat with natural follow-up questions</a>.</p>
<p>Other models support everything but Gemini Live. That list includes the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html">Google Nest Wifi point</a>, Google Nest Hub (1st gen), <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-19-google-home-max-review.html">Google Home Max</a>, Google Home Mini (1st gen) and Google Home.</p>
<p>Another point is that once you dive in, your Google Assistant days will be over (on your speakers, anyway). That&#39;s because Google says that, once you upgrade to Gemini for Home, your compatible devices can&#39;t downgrade to Assistant. That shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but it&#39;s worth keeping in mind before you take the plunge.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve confirmed that your speaker(s) are at least partially compatible, head to the Google Home app on a mobile device. There, tap your profile picture (or initials) on the top right. Then tap <strong>Home Settings &gt; Early Access</strong>. Congratulations: You&#39;ve put in your request.</p>
<p>The bad news is you may have to wait a bit to confirm your entry into the beta program. Once you&#39;re in, you&#39;ll see a notification from the Google Home app that reads, &quot;Introducing Gemini for Home.&quot; Select that, and follow the prompts. (If you accidentally dismiss the notification, you&#39;ll see the setup banner under Home settings in the Google Home app.)</p>

<p>At that point, all compatible speakers in your home will be upgraded to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/google-has-overhauled-its-smart-home-app-to-feature-gemini-130041497.html">Google&#39;s more intelligent AI assistant</a>. You can now throw more advanced questions at it, similar to what you&#39;d ask text-based chatbots like ChatGPT. Except this one sits on a shelf, ready to field your verbal requests at any moment.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Gemini Live requires a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_premium?hl=en-US">Google Home Premium subscription</a>. The standard version costs $10 per month or $100 per year. Meanwhile, the advanced tier doubles that: $20 per month or $200 per year. At least for now, the only difference between the two (for these purposes) is that the pricier plan supports a camera history search feature. Both premium tiers unlock access to Gemini Live. So, if that&#39;s all you need, you can save money and get standard.</p>
<p>Google offers <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/gemini-for-home-things-to-try/">plenty of examples</a> to get started. You can get quick answers to facts, like &quot;Hey Google, who are the top five scoring players in basketball history?&quot; (FYI: James, Abdul-Jabbar, Malone, Bryant and Jordan.) You can also ask Gemini Live to have a chat about ingredients for people with dietary needs. Or, ask it to explain complex topics (like how Wi-Fi works) in simple terms. It may not be at C-3PO level yet, but it&#39;s certainly moving in that direction.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/early-access-for-gemini-home-voice-assistant-is-now-available-heres-how-to-get-it-191250927.html?src=rss
