Valve&#39;s take on the year-end rewind, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Steam Replay</a>, is now available. It follows similar offerings from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Spotify</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/apple-music-replay-2025-is-here-to-highlight-your-unimpeachable-music-taste-151224318.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Apple Music</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstations-2025-wrap-up-is-here-so-you-can-see-how-many-hours-youve-sunk-into-death-stranding-2-191508693.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">PlayStation</a> and, increasingly, just about every service you use.
