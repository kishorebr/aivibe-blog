<p>Threads and Instagram are continuing to decouple. Meta&#39;s social network has updated its Hidden Words setting to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DLXyHScI2kz?xmt=AQF03CsMcCxVxZLoQ3c2f8buH8qbqxm98lOXn-LSZ442Hg">make it separate from Instagram</a>. Prior to this update, users had one global Hidden Words setting that impacted both platforms.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Hidden Words setting lets users filter out stuff they don&#39;t want to see. The setting can be applied to posts, feeds, searches, profiles and replies. The tool can filter out words, phrases and emojis.</p>

<p>Threads also offers the ability to snooze words and phrases for a period of 30 days. This is really useful for avoiding spoilers or just when you get tired of a certain discussion topic. Today&#39;s update even brings in the ability to filter out words and phrases in batches. Threads head Adam Mosseri says all of this was done so users could &quot;shape the experience into one where they feel comfortable expressing themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>When Threads <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html">launched in 2023</a>, it was basically an extension of Instagram. The two platforms have slowly been embracing independence the last couple of years.
