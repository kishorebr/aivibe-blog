<p>TikTok just announced that it will be hosting its first-ever <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/tiktok-awards-us-2025?lang=en"><ins>awards show in the US</ins></a>. The appropriately-named TikTok Awards will take place on December 18, starting at 9PM ET. It&#39;s a live event that will be held at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Of course, it&#39;ll be livestreamed on TikTok. The platform Tubi <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tubitv.com/tiktokawards"><ins>will begin streaming the event</ins></a> on the next day.</p>
<p>Awards will include stuff like &quot;Creator of the Year&quot; and &quot;Video of the Year.&quot; There will also be awards given for &quot;Breakthrough Artist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Muse of the Year.&quot; I&#39;m not sure what that last one means, but Paris Hilton grabbed a nomination for some reason.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most nominees are influencers of some sort. There are no traditional journalists in the mix, likely because the entire event seems to be apolitical. One of the clips nominated for &quot;Video of the Year&quot; features a fashion influencer holding up some unique finds. Another is a recipe for &quot;Homemade Dubai Chocolate&quot; that did make me pretty hungry, so there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Users will be able to vote for their favorite creators beginning on November 18. TikTok is launching a voting portal that&#39;ll be available on the platform.</p>
<p>The ceremony itself has all the trappings of a gala event. There&#39;s a red carpet, live performances, a live audience and more. This is in direct contrast to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-will-start-handing-out-awards-to-select-creators-170531135.html"><ins>recently-announced Instagram Ring awards.</ins></a> There&#39;s no live event for that one and the awards will be sent in the mail.</p>

<p>TikTok is no stranger to awards shows. It just hasn&#39;t been hosting them in the US. The social media app has created similar events in Germany, Mexico, Korea and other locations in the past several years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-announces-its-first-ever-awards-show-in-the-us-183711867.html?src=rss
