<p>Following its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/warner-signs-ai-music-licensing-deal-with-udio-213433325.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">licensing deal with Udio</a>, Warner Music Group (WMG) has also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.wmg.com/news/warner-music-group-and-suno-forge-groundbreaking-partnership" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reached an agreement with Suno</a> that will let the platform license its artists&#39; music and likenesses, and end the music company&#39;s ongoing litigation. WMG was previously one of several record labels <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/record-labels-sue-ai-music-generators-for-massive-infringement-of-recorded-music-172915925.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">suing Udio and Suno</a> for allegedly infringing on copyrighted works at a &quot;massive scale.&quot;</p><p>As part of the agreement, &quot;artists and songwriters will have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music,&quot; WMG explains in its press release for the announcement. WMG doesn&#39;t spell out how that will work for musicians impacted by the deal, but it does appear that participation will be opt-in, rather than anything being shared by default. This mirrors the opt-in structure of the company&#39;s Udio deal.</p><p>&quot;AI becomes pro-artist when it adheres to our principles: committing to licensed models, reflecting the value of music on and off platform, and providing artists and songwriters with an opt-in for the use of their name, image, likeness, voice and compositions in new AI songs,&quot; WMG CEO Robert Kyncl says.</p><p>Suno will also make adjustments to its AI music platform, possibly as a condition of the new partnership. WMG says Suno is launching &quot;new, more advanced and licensed models&quot; in 2026, after which its current models will be deprecated. The company will also limit music downloads to paid accounts. &quot;In the future, songs made on the free tier will not be downloadable and will instead be playable and shareable. Paid tier users will have limited monthly download caps with the ability to pay for more downloads,&quot; WMG says.&nbsp;</p><p>In an odd wrinkle to the partnership, Suno is also acquiring WMG&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.songkick.com/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Songkick</a> concert discovery platform. The company plans to continue running it, and WMG claims that &quot;the combination of Suno and Songkick will create new potential to deepen the artist-fan connection.&quot; An app for finding nearby concerts doesn&#39;t totally square with Suno&#39;s existing music creation tools, but maybe it suggests the company is interested in offering more social features down the road.</p><p>Prior to this agreement, Suno <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-startup-argues-scraping-every-song-on-the-internet-is-fair-use-233132459.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">openly admitted</a> to using &quot;essentially all music files of reasonable quality that are accessible on the open internet&quot; to train its AI model, under the auspices of fair use. That seems like a pretty blatant admission of copyright infringement, but apparently Warner Music Group is happier with the deals it struck than what it could have won through its lawsuit. The company is reportedly one of several music groups looking to strike <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-reportedly-wants-to-pay-record-labels-to-use-their-songs-for-ai-training-125052503.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a similar deal with YouTube</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/warner-music-drops-lawsuit-against-ai-music-platform-suno-in-exchange-for-licensing-agreement-224619025.html?src=rss
