<p>Google made its final arguments in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-proposes-alternative-remedies-for-its-search-monopoly-after-doj-demands-radical-changes-185253526.html">longstanding case</a> against the US Department of Justice on whether it has to split up its ad tech practices. However, the judge presiding over the case may be looking to wrap up the case before Google has a chance to appeal, according to a report from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-aims-dodge-breakup-ad-business-antitrust-trial-wraps-2025-11-21/"><em>Reuters</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, both sides made their closing statements in the lawsuit where the Justice Department accused the tech giant of illegally monopolizing the ad tech market. While the US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopoly-in-online-ad-tech-federal-judge-rules-151531919.html">ruled in April</a> that Google held a monopoly in the online adtech space, the judge recently asked the Justice Department how quickly an anticompetitive measure could go into effect, adding that &quot;time is of the essence.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google&#39;s attorney, Karen Dunn, argued that forcing Google to sell its advertising tech subsidiary would be extreme and hurt customers in the process, according to the report. Google is also reportedly planning to appeal the latest decision. According to <em>Reuters</em>, Brinkema noted that any sort of remedy &quot;most likely would not be as easily enforceable while an appeal is pending,&quot; meaning that Google could delay the forced sale until the appeal is concluded. At the same time, Google is facing a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-fines-google-35-billion-over-adtech-antitrust-violations-183701640.html">$3.5 billion fine</a> for violating the European Union&#39;s antitrust laws within the adtech industry.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/a-decision-about-breaking-up-googles-adtech-monopoly-is-on-the-horizon-184409011.html?src=rss
