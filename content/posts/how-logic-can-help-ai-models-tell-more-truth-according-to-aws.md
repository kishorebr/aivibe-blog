    How logic can help AI models tell more truth, according to AWS
     
    Linking AI models to formal verification methods can correct LLM shortcomings such as false assertions. Amazon's Byron Cook explains the promise of automated reasoning.

Amazon AWSThe term "reasoning" is a familiar metaphor in today's artificial intelligence (AI) technology, often used to describe the verbose outputs generated by so-called reasoning AI models such as OpenAI's o1 or DeepSeek AI's R1.Another kind of reasoning is quietly taking root in the most advanced applications, perhaps closer to actual reasoning.Also: Will AI think like humans? We're not even close - and we're asking the wrong questionRecently, Amazon AWS distinguished scientist Byron Cook made the case for what is called "automated reasoning," also known as "symbolic AI" or, more abstrusely, "formal verification." It is an area of study as old as the artificial intelligence field, and, said Cook, it is rapidly merging with generative AI to form an exciting new hybrid, sometimes termed "neuro-symbolic AI," which combines the best of automated reasoning and large language models.      Amazon AWSCook gave a talk about automated reasoning at the AWS Financial Services Symposium in New York this May.By whatever name you call it, automated reasoning refers to algorithms that search for statements or assertions about the world that can be verified as true by using logic. The idea is that all knowledge is rigorously supported by what's logically able to be asserted.Also: AI will boost the value of human creativity in financial services, says AWSAs Cook put it, "Reasoning takes a model and lets us talk accurat
