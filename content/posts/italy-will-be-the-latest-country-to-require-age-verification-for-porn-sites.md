<p>Later this month, Italian citizens will have one extra step to go through before getting on porn sites. On Friday, Italy&#39;s regulatory agency for communications, known as AGCOM, announced an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.agcom.it/comunicazione/avvisi/age-verification-dal-12-novembre-vigore-gli-obblighi-i-siti-e-le-piattaforme">age verification system</a> that&#39;s meant to prevent minors from accessing websites with pornographic content. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.agcom.it/sites/default/files/provvedimenti/comunicazione/2025/Prima%20lista%20soggetti%20ex%20art.%2013_bis%20da%20pubblicare_0.pdf">initial list</a> of sites covers around 50 sites, including Pornhub, XHamster and OnlyFans.</p>
<p>The new rule will require users to get verified through &quot;certified third parties,&quot; which could be another company, bank or mobile operator that already has the relevant info. Once the third party verifies the user&#39;s age, it will issue a code that grants access to the porn site. While the legislation&#39;s stated goal is to prevent harm to minors, the age verification process uses a &quot;double anonymity&quot; system to quell privacy concerns. In order to protect user privacy, porn sites can only see if a user is of age and not their identity, while the third-party verifier can only see the user&#39;s identity and not the website they&#39;re trying to get on.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the legislation, users have to do this each time they try to get on affected porn sites. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.agcom.it/comunicazione/avvisi/age-verification-dal-12-novembre-vigore-gli-obblighi-i-siti-e-le-piattaforme">AGCOM</a> said the new rule goes into effect on November 12, and any porn sites that are found non-compliant could be hit with penalties of up to 250,000 euros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Italy is the latest in the European Union to implement age verification rules, after France put a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yelvlnzveo">similar system</a> into place in the summer. Just outside the EU, the UK also recently introduced its own <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">age verification process</a> that requires either a selfie or government ID. Since then, Pornhub said that UK visitors to its site have plummeted <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkz3m3re1zo">77 percent</a>.</p>
