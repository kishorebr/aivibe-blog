<p>Development on the next Mass Effect is still underway, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">confirmed in a blog post</a> celebrating the series&#39; &quot;N7 Day&quot; fan holiday. Bioware shared that it had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-mass-effect-game-from-bioware-161639408.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">started work</a> on the new game in 2020, but Electronic Arts&#39; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">decision to go private</a> have naturally called the future of the series into question.</p><p>Gamble&#39;s blog post doesn&#39;t share many details about the new game beyond the fact that Bioware &quot;is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect.&quot; What does seem more clear is that the game could have some kind of connection to the Mass Effect TV show <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazon-is-making-a-mass-effect-television-show-185111285.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">currently in development</a> at Amazon. &quot;The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game,&quot; Gamble says. Notably, the series is set after the events of the original trilogy of games, and follows a new story in the universe&#39;s timeline. &quot;It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-beautiful-in-every-way-193013807.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a>, Bioware&#39;s last game, was not the smash hit <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">EA apparently wanted it to be</a>, and Bioware has appeared to go through a period of contraction in response. High-profile senior staff were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">let go in January 2025</a>, and even before the game was released, EA began <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bioware-cuts-around-50-jobs-to-become-a-more-agile-and-focused-studio-211513365.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">moving Bioware developers</a> to other studios. EA itself may also be adjusting its larger game development strategy. Following its proposed acquisition, the publisher <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-partners-with-the-company-behind-stable-diffusion-to-make-games-with-ai-222253069.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">announced a partnership</a> with Stability AI in October to create new AI-powered tools to better streamline its development process.</p><p>The Mass Effect series is beloved, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-mass-effect-review-150052114.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em></a>, the 2021 remaster that packaged all the trilogy&#39;s DLC and games into a single package, was a great reminder. With a new entry and a TV show in the works, Bioware seems poised for a comeback. It just needs to survive EA until then.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bioware-says-next-mass-effect-is-still-in-development-despite-turmoil-at-ea-200000050.html?src=rss
