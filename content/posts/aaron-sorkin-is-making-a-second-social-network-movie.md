<p>We're getting yet another Hollywood sequel. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/the-social-network-sequel-aaron-sorkin-1236439539/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that Aaron Sorkin will be directing <em>The Social Network II</em>, a follow-up to the film that chronicled the development of Facebook and the ensuing lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg. The next movie will take its inspiration from a 2021 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"><ins>investigation</ins></a> by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> into the harms caused by Facebook and the company's failure to address those problems.</p>
<p>Sorkin has a long career as a writer, including the screenplay for <em>The Social Network</em>, but only three credits as a director on his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/">resume</a>. There's no production date for the movie at this time, and it's unknown whether actors from the original will return to their roles, most notably Jesse Eisenberg as Zuck.</p>

Just in the past six months, the platform dug a deeper hole for itself when it tried to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-trying-to-stop-a-former-employee-from-promoting-her-book-about-facebook-004938899.html"><ins>quash</ins></a> a tell-all memoir with some <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-wildest-details-in-the-facebook-memoir-meta-is-trying-to-bury-183310491.html"><ins>pretty wild behind-the-scenes stories</ins></a> from a former employee. Facebook also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-ditching-third-party-fact-checkers-on-facebook-instagram-142330246.html"><ins>eliminated</ins></a> its third-party fact checkers and gutted its own hate speech policy, which was unsurprisingly followed by an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-sees-rise-in-violent-content-and-harassment-after-policy-changes-182651544.html"><ins>increase</ins></a> in violent content and harassment.
