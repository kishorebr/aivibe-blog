<p>Last week, social network Tea experienced a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/tea-app-suffers-breach-exposing-thousands-of-user-images-190731414.html"><ins>data breach</ins></a> that exposed personal information for its users. The dating safety app for women said at the time that &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that current or additional user data was affected.&quot; However, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/"><em>404 Media</em></a> reports that the problem is bigger than originally stated. The site credits independent security researcher <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kasra.codes/"><ins>Kasra Rahjerdi</ins></a>, who found that content from the platform as recent as last week has been exposed.</p>
<p>Additionally, this source claims that the compromised information could allow hackers to view messages between Tea users. DMs might include other sensitive information, such as personal phone numbers, discussions of cheating and experience obtaining abortions. <em>404 Media</em> claims this is a second leak of personal information at Tea, separate from the database posted on 4chan last week.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tea&#39;s security issues come during a surge in popularity. The app allows women to anonymously share personal stories about their dating experience, with the intended goal of letting others know if the men they are meeting might be a risk to their personal safety, were engaged in catfishing, or were already in a relationship.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve reached out to Tea for confirmation of whether this is a second breach or a part of the previously reported leaked data.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/data-breach-at-tea-reportedly-contains-images-and-dms-from-last-week-224823984.html?src=rss
