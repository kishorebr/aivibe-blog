<p>Block is the latest business to announce layoffs, with the operator of payment platforms Square and Cash App opting to cut jobs in favor of using more AI tools. The financial tech company, helmed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, is slashing its current staff of 10,000 to &quot;just under 6,000.&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dbc52635-39ff-4560-8b58-3e95b29b5f4e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzI2L2Jsb2NrLWxheWluZy1vZmYtYWJvdXQtNDAwMC1lbXBsb3llZXMtbmVhcmx5LWhhbGYtb2YtaXRzLXdvcmtmb3JjZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYmM1MjYzNS0zOWZmLTQ1NjAtOGI1OC0zZTk1YjI5YjVmNGUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjYvMDIvMjYvYmxvY2stbGF5aW5nLW9mZi1hYm91dC00MDAwLWVtcGxveWVlcy1uZWFybHktaGFsZi1vZi1pdHMtd29ya2ZvcmNlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX8swUTkdWppy1dQpMMQcy4GfjGyPz6-VKltHktSrP19&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Fblock-laying-off-about-4000-employees-nearly-half-of-its-workforce.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/26/block-laying-off-about-4000-employees-nearly-half-of-its-workforce.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> highlighted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a letter</a> Block sent to shareholders announcing the decision to nearly halve its workforce.

A significantly smaller team, using the tools we&#39;re building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.&quot;</p><p>We learned last year that Block had developed an AI agent called &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/jack-dorseys-block-has-an-ai-agent-too-212706083.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">codename goose</a>&quot; for interacting with LLMs. Leadership is clearly putting high expectations on that project and any other in-house tools to fill the shoes of thousands. &quot;intelligence will be at the core of how the entire company works.

It finished the 2025 financial year with operating income (profit after expenses) of $1.71 billion.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time the fintech company has made deep cuts in its employee count.
