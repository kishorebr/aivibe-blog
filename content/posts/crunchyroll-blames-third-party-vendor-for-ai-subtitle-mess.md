<p>At the start of last year, Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24080637/funimation-shut-down-crunchyroll-digital-library-compensation">told <em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>the company was &quot;very focused on testing&quot; generative AI tools for subtitling and captioning speech to text. The comment came just months after the streamer <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.cbr.com/yuzuki-familys-four-sons-episode-1-subtitles-bad-crunchyroll-remove-streaming/">temporarily took down</a> the debut episode of one of its newest shows, <em>The Yuzuki Family&#39;s Four Sons, </em>after people complained about poor subtitles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the translation was nonsensical, with missing punctuation in many sentences.  At the time, some fans speculated the company had used AI to translate the episode. Earlier this week, fresh accusations of AI use came up when an episode of new anime showed evidence ChatGPT was used to write the subtitles.</p>

<p>On July 1, Bluesky user Pixel <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/pixeldoesthings.bsky.social/post/3lswcbtkwec2t">spotted</a> an issue with the German subtitles for <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>, one of the new series Crunchyroll is streaming this anime season. Beyond a general sloppiness, one line began with the words &quot;ChatGPT said...&quot; during a pivotal scene in the show&#39;s debut episode. Engadget was able to independently verify the episode contains the AI-generated translation. If you&#39;re curious, the English subtitles aren&#39;t much better, as seen in the screenshots above and below.</p>
<p>&quot;We were made aware that AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement,&quot; a Crunchyroll spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We are investigating the matter and are working to rectify the error.&quot;</p>
<p>People were understandably upset about the subtitles. Crunchyroll <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-announces-first-price-hike-since-funimation-purchase-104035825.html">subscriptions start at $8 per month</a>, and since its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-220920170.html">acquisition by Sony</a>, service has been the dominant player in the anime streaming market outside of Japan. &quot;This is not acceptable. How can we be expected to pay for a service that clearly doesn&#39;t care about the quality of its products?&quot; wrote Pixel in their original post. As of the writing of this article, their post has been quoted more than 300 times and reposted by thousands of other people. Many fans say they&#39;re turning to torrented fansubs, calling the official AI-generated translations &quot;unwatchable.&quot; People on Reddit have <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crunchyroll/comments/1lp7vtx/necronomico_and_the_cosmic_horror_show_subtitles/">expressed similar frustrations</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, when Purini revealed Crunchyroll was testing generative AI tools for subtitles, he said part of the motivation was to prevent piracy. He reasoned the tech would allow the company to start streaming new, translated anime episodes as close to their original Japanese release as possible, adding the lag between official releases was sometimes what pushed fans to torrent shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
