<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign is continuing to gain momentum after hitting more than <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-has-hit-a-major-milestone-but-the-fights-just-begun-190431644.html">a million signatures</a> in July. After a July 31st deadline, the movement secured around 1.45 million signatures, which the organizers are currently in the process of verifying. The initiative aims to enact legislation that preserves access to video games, even when developers decide to end support, as seen with Ubisoft when it delisted <em>The Crew</em> and revoked access to players who already purchased the game. There were some early concerns about the potential for falsely-submitted signatures, but the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">latest update</a> from organizers said that early reports show around 97 percent of the signatures are valid.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works_en">European Commission&#39;s website</a>, EU authorities have three months to verify the signatures once they are submitted. After that, the organizers said they will personally deliver the petition to the European Commission. With initial estimates clearing the threshold of one million verified signatures, the following steps involve getting meetings with both the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>

There is the possibility of the governing bodies not taking any action at all, but the organizers said they are &quot;preparing to ensure our initiative cannot be ignored.&quot; To prepare for the meetings, the organizers said they will be reaching out to members of Parliament and the Commission, while also trying to counter any misinformation or industry lobbying. For now, the campaign will post more frequent updates on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://discord.gg/TCE6uXwsBe">Discord community</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/">social media channels</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html?src=rss
