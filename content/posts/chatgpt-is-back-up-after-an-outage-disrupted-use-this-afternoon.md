<p>If you had trouble using ChatGPT today, you aren&#39;t alone. The AI chatbot experienced a partial outage for many users this afternoon, with Down Detector saw reports reaching more than 12,000 reports around the peak point of the issue today.. OpenAI issued a status update shortly after noting that &quot;elevated error rates&quot; were occurring for ChatGPT and Platform users. That problem was marked as resolved at 5:14PM ET.</p><p>While the initial outage may be repaired, OpenAI does still have an active status alert up. It&#39;s only for the fine-tuning component of its API service. But the end may also be in sight for that final issue, because the current statement from the company is &quot;We have applied the mitigation and are monitoring the recovering.</p><p>Another AI chatbot, Anthropic’s Claude, also experienced an outage today. It <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://status.claude.com/incidents/pr6yx3bfr172" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">listed</a> similar issues with &quot;Elevated error rate on API across all Claude models.&quot; That status was resolved by 1PM ET. </p><p><strong>Update, February 3, 2025, 6:17PM ET: </strong>Updated to reflect the change in status and mention Claude outage.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-is-back-up-after-an-outage-disrupted-use-this-afternoon-210238686.html?src=rss
