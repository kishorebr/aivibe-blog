xAI’s CFO is the latest executive to leave Elon Musk’s AI firm


Mike Liberatore, xAI’s chief financial officer, has left the company, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. This marks the latest in a string of high-profile executive departures. 

The former Airbnb executive joined the company in April and left around the end of July, per the WSJ.


	
	




	
	



While at xAI, he helped orchestrate the company’s $5 billion debt raise, alongside another $5 billion in equity — almost half of which came from SpaceX. He also oversaw some of the Elon Musk-owned AI firm’s data center expansion in Memphis. 

Liberatore’s departure comes after xAI’s general counsel, Robert Keele, left in August — a little over a year on the job. Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer, left around the same time as Keele and Liberatore, per the WSJ. Igor Babuschkin, an xAI co-founder, announced his departure last month, saying he left the company to launch his own VC firm dedicated to AI safety research.

Linda Yaccarino, former CEO of X, also resigned in July following concerning behavior from Grok, xAI’s chatbot that can be accessed through X. xAI acquired X in late March.
