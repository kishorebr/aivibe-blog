			Clay confirms it closed $100M round at $3.1B valuation

			
Sales automation startup Clay has raised a $100 million Series C at a $3.1 billion valuation in a round led by CapitalG, confirming TechCrunch’s report from June.

The financing follows a $1.25 billion Series B round from six months ago and a $1.5 billion Sequoia-led tender offer announced a couple of months ago, which allowed most employees to sell some of their shares.


	
	




	
	



The latest deal brings Clay’s total funding to $204 million. Existing investors Meritech Capital, Sequoia Capital, First Round Capital, BoxGroup, and Boldstart also participated in the Series C, and a new backer, Sapphire Ventures, joined the round.

The 8-year-old startup helps salespeople and marketers with AI-powered tools and claims customers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Canva, Intercom, and Rippling.

Clay co-founder and CEO Kareem Amin told The New York Times that the company expects to end the year with $100 million in revenue, which would triple its revenue from last year.
