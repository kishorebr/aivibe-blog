Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, reported another quarter of sustained sales growth in its earnings statement Wednesday, with $46.7 billion in revenue, a 56% increase compared to the same period last year. That growth was largely fueled by AI-dominated data center business, which saw a 56% year-over-year increase in revenue.

Nvidia also saw its net income grow substantially since last year. The company reported a net income of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a 59% spike since the same period last year. 


	
	




	
	



All told, the company brought in $41.1 billion in revenue from data center sales in the quarter, suggesting that AI companies’ demand for cutting-edge GPUs continues to grow. The company’s most advanced generation of chips, Blackwell, accounted for $27 billion of those sales.

“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement accompanying the release. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.” 

Huang said that the company expects to see $3 to 4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. “$3 to 4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next five years,” he told one analyst.

The company made particular note of its role in the launch of OpenAI’s open source gpt-oss models earlier this month, which involved processing “1.5 million tokens per second on a single Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system.”

The earnings also gave a look at Nvidia’s ongoing struggle to sell its chips in Chinese markets. The company reported no sales of its China-focused H20 chip to Chinese customers in the past quarter; Nvidia did report $650 million worth of H20 chips had been sold to a customer outside China.
