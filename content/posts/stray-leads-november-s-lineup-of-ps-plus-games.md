<p>First up, there&#39;s the cat sim <em>Stray</em>. We praised the third-person cyberpunk adventure <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/stray-review-ps5-cyberpunk-adventure-cute-cat-173018571.html"><ins>in our initial review</ins></a>, in which we lauded the game&#39;s unique mechanics and puzzles. After all, you play as a cat in a dystopian and futuristic city. That&#39;s a one-of-a-kind premise, which is one reason it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/beloved-cat-sim-stray-comes-to-the-switch-on-november-19-184048780.html"><ins>became such a big hit</ins></a>. It&#39;ll be available for both PS4 and PS5. It&#39;s also worth noting that this was a day-one release for PS Plus Extra and Premium back in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>EA Sports WRC 24</em> is a popular racing sim developed by Codemasters, who made the Dirt series, the Grid franchise and plenty of official F1 games. This new one lets players participate in the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC.) Racers get access to a bunch of WRC, WRC2 and Junior WRC cars from the 2024 season, complete with current drivers and teams. This one is only for PS5.</p>

<p><em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</em> is certainly a battle similar, but not an accurate one. The game lets you design all kinds of bizarre battle scenarios with &quot;the wobbliest physics system ever created.&quot; This is the best game ever made that lets you battle a wooly mammoth with balloon arrows, thus forcing that beast into the sky. It&#39;ll be available for both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>As always, a crop of new games means that some pre-existing titles are heading to that farm upstate. You have until November 3 to download <em>Alan Wake 2</em>,<em> Goat Simulator 3</em> and <em>Cocoon</em> to their game library. Dang. Last month was stacked.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html?src=rss
