<p>NBA League Pass, the streaming service that lets you catch hundreds of out-of-market NBA games, is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:National Basketball Association;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c109eac4-825f-483e-8edf-51532ca9e7cb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a364f8fe-4cef-4bc2-89cf-730e7b34af39&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=National+Basketball+Association&amp;linkText=on+sale+right+now&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmEuY29tL2xlYWd1ZS1wYXNzLXB1cmNoYXNlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMzY0ZjhmZS00Y2VmLTRiYzItODljZi03MzBlN2IzNGFmMzkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbGVhZ3VlLXBhc3MtcHVyY2hhc2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdUhKaPYHJzinvfA7MLKAWA2Ghk-P2COLZr_GV2bgBXf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fleague-pass-purchase" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nba.com/league-pass-purchase">on sale right now</a> for up to 55 percent off. The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from $160, while League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. We&#39;re almost halfway through the season at this point, so it makes sense for a service like League Pass to start offering some discounts.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>
