<p>Google Maps suffered an outage that left the mobile version of the service unable to fully load its map or provide directions. Over 4,000 reports were filed <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/google-maps/">on Downdetector</a> since the outage started, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://status.cloud.google.com/maps-platform/incidents/vWxTa1akdG4FptNdRkk8">Google's Status Dashboard noted</a> that the company was investigating an issue with the Maps SDK and Navigation SDK at 3:34PM ET. By 6:27PM ET, Google said the issue has been resolved and that it will publish an "analysis of this incident" once it has completed its internal investigation.</p>
<p>At the peak of the outage, both the Android and iOS versions of Google Maps were unable to fully load a map, display listings or provide directions. In at least one case, the apps also showed an error message saying that Google Maps "Cannot reach server." Whatever caused the outage hasn't extend to the web version of the navigation service, which continues to work as normal.</p>

<p>Google's dashboard updated to say that "mitigation work is currently underway by our engineering team" and that it was "seeing indications of recovery" at around 5:22PM ET. Around 30 minutes later, the company said that the issue was partially resolved, but that it couldn't share "an ETA for full resolution at this point."</p>
<p>In the description of the issue on Google's Status Dashboard, Google has yet to provide an explanation for the outage or detailed what it's doing to fix the issue. Engadget has contacted Google for more information and will update this article if we here back.</p>
<p>Google's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-cloud-outages-spotify-discord-snapchat-and-more-were-down-for-hours-193156868.html">last major outage</a> occurred in June, though it was primarily concentrated in the company's Google Cloud service. Given the number of clients who use Google Cloud, the outage impacted everything from Spotify to Snapchat for multiple hours.</p>
