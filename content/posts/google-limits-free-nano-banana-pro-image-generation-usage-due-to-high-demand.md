<p>If you were hoping to create some silly images this long holiday weekend with Google&#39;s new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Nano Banana Pro</a> model, I have some bad news: the company is restricting free usage of the AI system. In a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">support document</a> spotted by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/gemini-3-pro-free-limits/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>9to5Google</em></a><em>, </em>Google notes free users can currently generate two images daily, down from three per day previously. &quot;Image generation and editing is in high demand,&quot; the company writes. &quot;Limits may change frequently and will reset daily.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It would appear Google is also limiting free Gemini 3 Pro usage, with the document stating non-paying users will get “basic access — daily limits may change frequently&quot; as well. When the company first began rolling out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Gemini 3 Pro on November 18</a>, it guaranteed five free prompts per day. That was in line with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-experimental-ai-model-gemini-25-pro-is-now-available-to-free-users-too-150005863.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>. If you pay for either Google AI Pro or AI Ultra plan, your usage limits have not changed. They remain at 100 and 500 prompts per day, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Google isn&#39;t the first company to enforce stricter usage following a popular release. You may recall OpenAI delayed rolling out ChatGPT&#39;s built-in image generator to free users after the feature <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-built-in-image-generator-for-chatgpt-is-now-available-to-free-users-120003146.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">turned out to be more popular</a> than anticipated. However, OpenAI eventually brought image generation to free users.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-limits-free-nano-banana-pro-image-generation-usage-due-to-high-demand-223442929.html?src=rss
