<p>Starting September 1, fully autonomous cars will require a permit to operate in Texas. This new restriction comes after the state's governor, Greg Abbott, signed into law the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2807">SB 2807</a> bill that requires authorization from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles for self-driving cars on public streets without human interaction.</p>
<p>The signing of the new law coincides with Tesla's launch of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/battleangelviv/status/1936788771598414079">robotaxi service</a> in Austin today where invited guests got to ride in fully autonomous Model Ys. While the law doesn't go into effect until a few months later, Tesla's robotaxi launch could have skirted this new regulation since all rides are accompanied by a human "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-inaugural-robotaxi-rides-will-have-a-human-safety-monitor-on-board-161307639.html">safety monitor</a>" in the front passenger seat.</p>

<p>In the coming months, Texas' new law may prove to be more than just a headache for Tesla. Besides the permits, the upcoming regulation allows state authorities the ability to revoke permits and requires companies to provide methods of dealing with self-driving cars in emergency situations to police and first responders. While this could become a serious hurdle for Tesla, it's also likely to affect Waymo, since it currently operates an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-ubers-austin-robotaxi-expansion-begins-today-120035908.html">autonomous ride-hailing service</a> in Austin.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/texas-will-require-permits-for-self-driving-cars-starting-in-september-164755457.html?src=rss
