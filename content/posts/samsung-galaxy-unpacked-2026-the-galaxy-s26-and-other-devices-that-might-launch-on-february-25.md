Official invites have  been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still not completely confirmed. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.</p><p>Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live from San Francisco next week, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NjfXL1u7x4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-when-is-unpacked-2026-taking-place">When is Unpacked 2026 taking place?</h2><p>According to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-galaxy-s26-unpacked-event-is-on-february-25-230000375.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">official invite that Samsung shared</a> on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.</p><h2 id="jump-link-galaxy-s26-s26-and-s26-ultra">Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/59db82d0-d8d0-11ef-babd-deb856accfc5" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/59db82d0-d8d0-11ef-babd-deb856accfc5" style="height:1200px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo" data-uuid="adc661da-f271-3d94-b1ce-d6f264064d65"><figcaption>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus" data-i13n="slk:leaked;cpos:6;pos:1">leaked</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/galaxy-s26-ultra-will-look-more-premium-than-the-s25-ultra.html" data-i13n="slk:images;cpos:7;pos:1">images</a> of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html" data-i13n="slk:iPhone 16 Pro;cpos:8;pos:1">iPhone 16 Pro</a> to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html" data-i13n="slk:iPhone 17 Pro;cpos:9;pos:1">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.</p><p>Qualcomm's new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qualcomms-new-flagship-mobile-platform-is-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-060427445.html" data-i13n="slk:Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip;cpos:10;pos:1">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip</a> is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251020054600003?input=1195m" data-i13n="slk:Yonhap News reports;cpos:11;pos:1"><em>Yonhap News</em> reports</a> Samsung's relatively new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2600/" data-i13n="slk:Exynos 2600 chip;cpos:12;pos:1">Exynos 2600 chip</a> could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="width:608px;height:596px;width:608px;height:596px;width:608px;height:596px;width:608px;height:596px;width:640px;height:596px;width:640px;height:596px;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+.

The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1994663953180627176?s=20" data-i13n="slk:shared by leaker Ice Universe;cpos:13;pos:1">shared by leaker Ice Universe</a>, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.</p><p>The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/galaxy-s26-ultra-will-look-more-premium-than-the-s25-ultra.html" data-i13n="slk:According to Android Headlines;cpos:14;pos:1">According to <em>Android Headlines</em></a>, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-doesnt-fully-support-qi2-on-its-own-180011574.html" data-i13n="slk:only technically work with the standard;cpos:15;pos:1">only technically work with the standard</a> when a case is attached, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/25/galaxy-s26-ultra-removes-s-pen-digitizer/" data-i13n="slk:rumors suggest;cpos:16;pos:1">rumors suggest</a> Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.</p><p><em>Android Headlines</em> also recently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-design" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">shared what appear to be full image renders</a> of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.</p><p>Fans of magnets may <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/android-phone-makers-dropped-the-ball-on-qi2-in-2024-191029769.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">continue to be disappointed</a> by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables,  <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Ultra" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1"><em>Nieuwemobiel.nl</em></a> is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.</p><h2 id="jump-link-galaxy-buds-4">Galaxy Buds 4</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/ad3a06e0-3ea2-11ef-abf6-693055a6aa30" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/ad3a06e0-3ea2-11ef-abf6-693055a6aa30" style="height:619px;width:1100px;" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case." data-uuid="a234976a-e5ea-37c3-88ac-a1377597a567"><figcaption>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung released the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review-airpods-clones-that-actually-deliver-171024116.html" data-i13n="slk:Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro;cpos:20;pos:1">Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro</a> in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods.
