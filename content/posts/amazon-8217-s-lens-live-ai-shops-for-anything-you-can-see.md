<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon will now let you shop for products by pointing your camera at them. On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/search-image-amazon-lens-live-shopping-rufus">company announced Lens Live</a>, a new feature that uses your camera to scan things in the environment around you, while surfacing matching product listings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This feature, which is only rolling out to the Amazon Shopping app on iOS for now, lets you pan your camera around a room or focus on a specific product. Amazon says Lens Live will use an object detection model to identify the products shown on your camera in real-time, and then compare them against the billions of products on its marketplace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once it finds similar items, Lens Live will display them in a swipeable carousel, where it will also show options to add products to your cart or wishlist. It sounds like Amazon’s take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763114/google-gemini-live-ai-visual-guidance-speech-update">Google’s Gemini Live</a>, an AI-powered assistant that similarly lets you scan things in your environment and ask questions about them. The difference is that Amazon’s AI tool puts a big “buy” button on everything you see.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lens Live also integrates <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197173/amazon-ai-shopping-assistant-rufus-us-customers-rollout">Amazon’s AI assistant Rufus</a> to summarize product descriptions and answer questions about them. The feature builds upon the existing capabilities of Amazon’s visual search features, which let <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/how-to-use-amazon-lens">you search</a> for products by uploading an image, scanning a barcode, or snapping a picture in the Amazon Shopping app. Amazon plans on bringing Lens Live to more customers in the “coming weeks.”</p>
