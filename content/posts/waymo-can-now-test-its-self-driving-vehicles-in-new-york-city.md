<p>Waymo can now test its self-driving cars in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2025/08/mayor-adams--dot-announce-approval-of-first-application-to-test-">announced</a>. Local authorities have granted the company the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It&#39;s the first-ever permit for the &quot;testing deployment&quot; of AVs the city has granted. Waymo will be able to deploy a fleet with up to eight vehicles in the city until late September 2025. For now, though, the permit only allows Waymo to test its AVs with drivers behind the wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-to-test-its-driverless-system-in-ten-new-cities-in-2025-193852446.html">announced</a> earlier this year that it was going to test its driverless system in 10 new cities in 2025. In June, it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-will-start-testing-its-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-again-190530022.html">filed a request</a> for permission to test its AVs in New York City in hopes that it can someday bring its autonomous ride-hailing service to the Big Apple. To note, while Adams said the city granted Waymo the first permit of its kind, the company deployed its vehicles to map some parts of NYC <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">back in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the permit, Waymo will be required to regularly report the data gathered from its testing to the Department of Transportation to certify that it&#39;s &quot;adhering to the industryâ€™s best practices related to cybersecurity.&quot; Waymo will be given the opportunity to apply for an extension after its pilot testing period ends in September. It may have to continue testing them with human operators for a while, though: New York state law prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, but Waymo told <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2025/08/22/waymo-secures-permit-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city/"><em>Forbes</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that it&#39;s lobbying to change the regulation.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-can-now-test-its-self-driving-vehicles-in-new-york-city-150015938.html?src=rss
