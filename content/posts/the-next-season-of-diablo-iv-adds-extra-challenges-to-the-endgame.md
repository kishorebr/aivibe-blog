<p><em>Diablo IV</em> has been demonically chugging along since the release of the major <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vessel-of-hatred-is-the-latest-reason-to-start-playing-diablo-iv-again-160036459.html"><em><ins>Vessel of Hatred</ins></em></a> expansion last fall. The seasonal model usually brings temporary gameplay updates and storylines, but when Season 9 hits on July 1, it will add a couple of useful <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215863/purge-the-sins-of-the-horadrim"><ins>permanent</ins></a> changes.
