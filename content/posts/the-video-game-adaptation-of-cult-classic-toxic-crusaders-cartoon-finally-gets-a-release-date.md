<p>The streets of Tromaville, New Jersey are calling once again as the video game adaptation of the off-the-wall cartoon series<em> Toxic Crusaders</em> gets a release date. Seen in an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVtgZyTnDmo">official trailer</a> from Retroware that was shown off during San Diego Comic-Con and shared online by IGN, the <em>Toxic Crusaders</em> game is releasing on December 4 on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and Steam.</p>

<p>As a true callback to the quirky cartoon from the &#39;90s, the video game is designed as a side-scrolling beat &#39;em up, all packaged in a fitting pixel art style. In <em>Toxic Crusaders</em>, you can select up to seven characters from the series, each with their own unique movesets and abilities, and join together for up to four players in local co-op. For <em>Toxic Crusaders</em> fans wanting more after the original series ended without a second season, this adaptation picks up where things left off. You&#39;ll still run into some familiar faces, like the story&#39;s main villain, Dr. Killemoff and his two bumbling henchmen.</p>
