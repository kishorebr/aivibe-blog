<p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered Meta to change Facebook and Instagram&#39;s timelines, after finding that the element ran afoul of the European Union&#39;s Digital Services Act (DSA). As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/dutch-court-orders-meta-change-facebook-instagram-timeline-settings-2025-10-02/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the Dutch court said that the company needs to provide users with simpler options â€” namely ones that don&#39;t rely on an algorithm.</p>
<p>&quot;People in the Netherlands are not sufficiently able to make free and autonomous choices about the use of profiled recommendation systems,&quot; the court said in its decision. It ruled that the timeline must honor a user&#39;s choice of chronological order or other non-profiled options, instead of reverting to the algorithm-driven version whenever a user closes and reopens either app.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The case was brought by Bits of Freedom, a Dutch digital rights group. &quot;It is unacceptable that a few American tech billionaires can determine how we view the world,&quot; said the group&#39;s spokesperson, Maartje Knaap.</p>
<p>Meta said it will appeal the decision, and that these DSA issues should be handled by the European Commission and other EU regulators, not by the courts of individual nations. &quot;Proceedings like this threaten the digital single market and the harmonized regulatory regime that should underpin it,&quot; a Meta spokesperson said. Meta faces a potential fine of $117,450 for every day it fails to comply with the court&#39;s order, up to a maximum of $5.8 million.</p>
<p>The DSA has been a common thorn in the side of big tech companies since its approval in 2022.
