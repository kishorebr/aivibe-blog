<p>Spotify recently <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.avclub.com/spotify-stands-by-ice-recruitment-ads">came under fire</a> for running recruitment ads for ICE, which ask users to &quot;join the mission to protect America&quot; and to &quot;fulfill [their] mission,&quot; in the US. Despite music labels calling on the streaming service to stop serving ICE recruitment ads, Spotify doubled down. A spokesperson for the company told <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ddc4d161-c193-4ff7-b214-cebb6c5121a0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Independent&amp;linkText=The+Independent&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL3VzLXBvbGl0aWNzL2ljZS1yZWNydWl0bWVudC1hZHMtc3BvdGlmeS1zdHJlYW1pbmctYjI4NDY2MzQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGRjNGQxNjEtYzE5My00ZmY3LWIyMTQtY2ViYjZjNTEyMWEwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL3VzLXBvbGl0aWNzL2ljZS1yZWNydWl0bWVudC1hZHMtc3BvdGlmeS1zdHJlYW1pbmctYjI4NDY2MzQuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATqU-9ErkCyATqpLVa9x7ETZ3ozNJFxiVmg2MLnA2eeA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Fice-recruitment-ads-spotify-streaming-b2846634.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-recruitment-ads-spotify-streaming-b2846634.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> that the ads are &quot;part of a broad campaign&quot; by the US government running across different channels and that they do not violate its policies. The spokesperson advised users to just mark ads with a thumbs up or down so that the app can learn their preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, several artists have <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/artists-left-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-military-tech-1235425098/">pulled their music</a> from Spotify recently over its CEO&#39;s, Daniel EK&#39;s, investments in European defense tech firm Helsing. The defense company builds drones, aircraft and submarines, and it also sells AI software that can analyze sensor and weapons data from battlefields. Spotify has been facing backlash for its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-tries-to-defend-its-artist-payout-rates-120021659.html">payout rates</a>, which artists argue are unfair and lower than what other services pay, over the past few years as well.&nbsp;</p>
