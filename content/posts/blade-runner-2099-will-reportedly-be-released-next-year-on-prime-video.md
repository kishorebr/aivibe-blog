<p>Amazon&#39;s Blade Runner limited series finally has a release window. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/blade-runner-2099-premiere-window-2026-prime-video-1236495769/"><em><ins>Deadline</ins></em></a> reports that the upcoming sequel show, <em>Blade Runner 2099</em>, is slated for a 2026 release on Prime Video. The story at this point remains a mystery, though the title suggests it&#39;ll take place 50 years after the events of <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. Ridley Scott is said to be involved in the production.</p>
<p>It was revealed last year that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/michelle-yeoh-just-got-cast-to-lead-amazons-blade-runner-show-180312046.html"><ins>Michelle Yeoh will star in the series</ins></a>, and according to <em>Deadline</em>, she&#39;ll be joined by Hunter Schafer, Dimitri Abold, Lewis Gribben, Katelyn Rose Downey and Daniel Rigby. We first heard about <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/blade-runner-live-action-series-amazon-182855264.html">the possibility of <em>Blade Runner 2099</em> back in 2022</a>, when it was reported that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/blade-runner-2099-amazon-prime-video-series-194815887.html">Amazon Studios</a> was developing a live-action series set in that universe, but there have been few updates since. The release window was noted in an internal memo obtained by <em>Deadline</em>, which reports that the series is now in post-production.</p>
