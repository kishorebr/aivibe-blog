If there’s one thing that VCs agree on when backing AI startups, it’s that AI requires a different investment approach than prior technological shifts.

“It’s a funky time,” said Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. The longtime VC noted that the rules of investing have significantly shifted now that some AI companies are leaping from “zero to $100 million in revenue in a single year.”


	
	




	
	



However, Lee also noted that, based on her firm’s research, Series A investors aren’t just seeking rapid revenue growth. “It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients.”

Some of the factors investors now measure, according to Lee, include whether the startup is generating data, the strength of its competitive moat, the founders’ past accomplishments, and the technical depth of the product. “Depending on what your company is, the output of the algorithmic formula is going to be different,” she said.

Jon McNeill, co-founder and CEO of startup creation firm DVx Ventures, stated that even startups that grow rapidly from inception to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding. “I think this game has changed, and it is changing dynamically,” he said.

McNeill noted that Series A investors are now applying the same rigorous standards to seed-stage startups that they previously reserved for more mature companies.

“I think a lot of investors have figured out that the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech,” McNeill said about why Series A VCs are looking so closely at startups’ ability to attract and retain customers. “They have the best go-to market.”
