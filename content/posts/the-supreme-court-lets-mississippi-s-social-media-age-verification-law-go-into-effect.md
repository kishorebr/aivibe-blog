<p>The Supreme Court has decided not to weigh in on one of the many state-level age-verification laws currently being reviewed across the country. Today, the top court chose not to intervene on legislation from Mississippi about checking the ages of social media users, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf"><ins>denying</ins></a> an application to vacate stay from NetChoice.</p>
<p>The Mississippi law requires all users to verify their ages in order to use social media sites. It also places responsibility on the social networks to prevent children from accessing &quot;harmful materials&quot; and it requires parental consent for minors to use any social media. NetChoice represents several tech companies — including social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube — and it sued to block the law on grounds that it violates the First Amendment. A district court ruled in favor of NetChoice, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its temporary block.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh denied the application to vacate stay on the appeals court ruling, he also wrote that &quot;NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits—namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members&#39; First Amendment rights under this Court’s precedents.&quot; He denied the application because NetChoice &quot;has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.&quot; This decision means that, at least for now, Mississippi&#39;s law will be allowed to stand.</p>
<p>&quot;Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment,&quot; <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://netchoice.org/netchoice-confident-the-first-amendment-will-prevail-against-mississippis-i-d-for-speech-law/">said</a> Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center. &quot;This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.&quot;</p>
<p>There are several other state laws being assessed at various points in the US legal system. Some are centered on adult content providers such as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/27/nx-s1-5422424/scotus-texas-porn-law"><ins>pornography sites</ins></a>, while others are more broadly targeting social media use. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/arkansas-social-media-age-verification-law-blocked-by-federal-judge-194614568.html"><ins>Arkansas</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/floridas-social-media-law-has-been-temporarily-blocked-by-a-federal-judge-123004847.html"><ins>Florida</ins></a> have seen federal judges block their laws, while <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/texas-is-getting-ready-to-ban-social-media-for-anyone-under-18-180202219.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-new-nebraska-law-wants-to-make-social-media-less-addictive-for-kids-171510432.html"><ins>Nebraska</ins></a> are working toward adopting their own rules about social media for minors.</p>
