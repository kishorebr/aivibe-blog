<p>During its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-playstation-state-of-play-of-2026-will-air-on-february-12-145747775.html">State of Play</a> livestream on Thursday, Sony revealed the first PlayStation Plus Game Catalog addition for February and it&#39;s a doozy. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-spider-man-2-review-the-rare-game-thats-both-bigger-and-better-140002497.html"><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></a> (PS5) will finally websling its way onto the Game Catalog on February 17.</p>
<p><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em>was released in October 2023, and Insomniac&#39;s third Spidey game is the the best of the bunch. You can play as both Peter Parker and his protégé Miles Morales. Each Spidey has his own skill tree and moveset to master.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Traversing New York (with a lot more of it explorable than in previous entries) has never felt better thanks to the addition of the wingsuit, while the set pieces are frequently breathtaking. <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em>remains one of the PS5’s flagship games, and with <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Remastered</em> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em>Miles Morales</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>already on the Game Catalog, Extra and Premium subscribers can now play the whole series while they wait for Insomniac&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/marvels-wolverine-slices-his-way-onto-ps5-in-fall-2026-220250305.html"><em>Wolverine</em></a> game to arrive later this year.</p>
<p>Sony later revealed the full PS Plus Game Catalog lineup for February on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>. It includes <em>Neva </em>(PS4 and PS5), a stunning 2D platformer that&#39;s pretty much an interactive fairytale. Engadget’s Jessica Conditt opened her<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neva-review-a-platformer-thats-so-perfect-it-made-me-cry-160037311.html"> review</a> of the game by saying she had &quot;absolutely nothing negative to say&quot; about it, which is surely about as effusive as a recommendation can get. (A paid expansion that acts as a prequel is on the way next week too.)</p>
<p>The other titles coming to the PS Plus Game Catalog on February 17 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown </em>(PS5)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Season: A Letter to the Future</em> (PS4 and PS5)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin </em>(PS4)</p></li>

<li><p><em>Rugby 25 </em>(PS4 and PS5)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PS Plus Premium members will have an extra game to play on PS4 and PS5 in the form of<em> Disney Pixar Wall-E</em>. This version was originally released in 2008 for the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, <em>Tekken Dark Resurrection</em> will be available to Premium subscribers in March. Premium members will be able to play the original <em>Time Crisis</em> on their PS5 with gyro controls in May, which sounds fun. Also,<em>&nbsp;</em><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html"><em>Big Walk</em></a>, a multiplayer game from <em>Untitled Goose Game </em>developer House House, will be available on all three PS Plus tiers when it debuts later this year.</p>
