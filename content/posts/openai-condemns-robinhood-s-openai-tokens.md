OpenAI wants to make clear that Robinhood’s sale of “OpenAI tokens” will not give everyday consumers equity — or stock — in OpenAI, the company said in a post from its official newsroom account on X. OpenAI says it does not endorse Robinhood’s effort, nor was it involved in facilitating the token sale.

“These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity,” said OpenAI’s newsroom account on Wednesday. “We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful.”

OpenAI’s statement is a response to Robinhood’s announcement earlier this week that it would start selling  so-called tokenized shares of OpenAI, SpaceX, and other private companies to people in the European Union.


	
	




	
	



Robinhood says the launch represents an attempt to give everyday people exposure to equity in the world’s most valuable private companies via blockchain. Hours after announcing these token sales, Robinhood’s stock price shot to an all-time high.

But stock in private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX are not available to the public. That’s what makes them private. They sell shares to investors of their choosing. 

So OpenAI is openly disavowing Robinhood’s effort. 

In response to OpenAI’s condemnation, Robinhood spokesperson Rouky Diallo told TechCrunch that OpenAI tokens were part of a “limited” giveaway to offer retail investors indirect exposure “through Robinhood’s ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle (SPV).”
