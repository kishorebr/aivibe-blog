<p>Channels once banned by YouTube for spreading false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2020 election may soon have the opportunity to get their channels back, in a decision transparently courting &quot;conservative voices.&quot;</p>
<p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-09-23-letter-to-hjc.pdf"><ins>sent a letter</ins></a> via counsel to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/in-the-news/google-reinstate-banned-youtube-accounts-censored-political-speech"><ins>House Judiciary Committee</ins></a> in which it alleges the company was pressured by the Biden administration to take down misinformation on YouTube related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate the company&#39;s existing policies at the time. It now describes the Biden administration&#39;s actions as &quot;unacceptable and wrong.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also informed the committee that YouTube would be offering a path to reinstatement for creators whose channels were banned for repeatedly violating community guidelines on election-integrity-related content, as well as for COVID-19-related content. The guidelines under which those bans were carried out were removed by the company in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Details on exactly what the path for reinstatement looks like were not shared.</p>
<p>&quot;The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented time in which online platforms had to reach decisions about how best to balance freedom of expression with responsibility,&quot; the letter reads. &quot;Senior Biden administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the company regarding user generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies.&quot;</p>
<p>Alphabet goes on to denounce any government attempts to &quot;dictate how the Company moderates content,&quot; and says it will always &quot;fight against those efforts on First Amendment grounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Notable YouTube channels banned for either COVID-19 or election-integrity-related content include <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/steve-bannon-war-room-channel-015616583.html"><ins>Steve Bannon&#39;s War Room</ins></a>, Co-Deputy Director of the FBI <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/youtube-permanently-bans-fox-news-host-dan-bongino-2022-01-26/"><ins>Dan Bongino&#39;s channel</ins></a> and the channel for <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.axios.com/2021/09/29/youtube-anti-vax-misinformation-vaccination?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><ins>Children&#39;s Health Defense</ins></a>, an organization previously linked with Secretary of HHS RFK Jr. &quot;YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse,&quot; the company wrote. In its letter, Alphabet also expresses concern that the European Union&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20211209STO19124/eu-digital-markets-act-and-digital-services-act-explained"><ins>Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act</ins></a> could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The letter was sent in response to subpoenas as part of the House Judiciary Committee&#39;s ongoing investigations into alleged government-directed content moderation. The committee recently <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/europes-threat-american-speech-and-innovation"><ins>held a hearing</ins></a> on &quot;Europeâ€™s Threat to American Speech and Innovation,&quot; among others.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/youtube-may-reinstate-channels-banned-for-spreading-covid-and-election-misinformation-190257602.html?src=rss
