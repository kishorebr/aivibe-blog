<p>Xbox was well on its way to delivering a sci-fi stylized game with plenty of exciting movement mechanics before an abrupt change of heart. The upcoming third-person shooter RPG codenamed Blackbird from ZeniMax Online Studios, which developed <em>The Elder Scrolls Online, </em>has been &quot;shelved indefinitely,&quot; according to an exclusive report from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The report added that Xbox execs were &quot;blown away&quot; by the game and had &quot;nothing but complimentary words,&quot; according to <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources.</p>
<p>The exciting new IP was expected to rival the <em>Destiny</em> franchise with its looter-shooter gameplay in an alien noir-themed world. The <em>Bloomberg</em> report revealed that a sci-fi setting would be paired with movement-based abilities like &quot;double-jumping, air-dashing, a grappling hook and wall climbing.&quot; The project was reportedly gaining momentum recently and was set to be released in 2028, after the studio expanded its team to 300 people.</p>
