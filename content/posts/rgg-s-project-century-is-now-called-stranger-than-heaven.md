<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio first teased <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rgg-reveals-a-virtua-fighter-revival-and-a-brawler-set-in-the-1910s-025324254.html">"Project Century"</a> in 2024, and at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rgg-reveals-a-virtua-fighter-revival-and-a-brawler-set-in-the-1910s-025324254.html">Summer Game Fest</a> it debuted a new trailer revealing the game's full name: <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sega.prezly.com/segar-confirms-stranger-than-heaven-as-next-new-ip-from-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio-new-teaser-trailer-released"><em>Stranger Than Heaven</em></a>. The game clearly draws on the bareknuckle brawling of the Yakuza series, but this time is set in the jazzy Japan of 1943.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a full sense of the story from the trailer alone, but similar to RGG's previous games, it looks like <em>Stranger Than Heaven</em> will feature an open-world full of enemies to whoop and narrative choices that'll be as determined by who you punch as who you help. If the player character Mako Taito isn't a private eye, he does appear to be investigating something.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>RGG's released a Like a Dragon spin-off, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-next-like-a-dragon-game-recasts-a-series-regular-as-an-amnesiac-pirate-142935001.html"><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em></a>earlier this year. Before that, it's last major entry in the melodramatic crime saga was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-make-you-see-ichibans-bare-butt-in-early-2024-175557876.html"><em>Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in 2024. Besides the gameplay similarities, it's not clear if <em>Stranger Than Heaven</em> is set in the same world as RGG's other open-world action RPGs. At the very least, it does seem incredibly stylish, though.</p>
<p><em>Stranger Than Heaven</em> is still in-development and doesn't currently have a release date.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rggs-project-century-is-now-called-stranger-than-heaven-232848763.html?src=rss
