<p>Preservation has become a pressing topic for games in this era of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">digital-only releases</a> and games-as-a-service. So it&#39;s wonderful to have a big win in archiving a trio of seminal text games for the ages. Microsoft <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/20/preserving-code-that-shaped-generations-zork-i-ii-and-iii-go-open-source" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced</a> today that the code for <em>Zork</em>, <em>Zork II</em> and <em>Zork III</em> will be made available open source under the MIT License. The company&#39;s Open Source Programs Office, Xbox and Activision all contributed to the effort. &quot;The goal is not to modernize Zork but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education,&quot; Microsoft team members wrote in the blog post sharing the news.</p><p>They&#39;re works well-worth studying.

Not only was it a unique experience of narrative and puzzles, but the accomplishments of the Z-Machine virtual machine it ran on helped make <em>Zork</em> easily available to players on multiple platforms during the rise of personal computers in the 1990s. There are still modern Z-Machine interpreters out there (or you can buy and play all three Zork titles the normal way thanks to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gogs-preservation-label-highlights-classic-games-its-maintaining-for-modern-hardware-231606454.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">similarly preservation-minded folks</a> at Good Old Games). </p><p>The code for many famous text games made by Infocom was released on GitHub <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-for-all-infocom-text-adventure-classics/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in 2019</a>, but the rights still technically belonged to Activision, which could have issued a takedown. This move keeps the code for this iconic Zork games available for the ages. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsoft-has-open-sourced-the-zork-trilogy-of-text-games-213519368.html?src=rss
