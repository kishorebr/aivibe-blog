Other times, it&#39;s an agonizing experience akin to pulling teeth. More than a decade after first announcing the project, Lunar Software and Raw Fury appear to be in the home stretch with their project <em>Routine</em>. The sci-fi horror game has been given a December 4, 2025 release date. For their sakes, I hope it comes to pass.</p><p>The duo first announced <em>Routine</em> all the way back at Gamescom in 2012 and gave it a 2013 release date. After that window came and went, the project went dark until <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/routine-is-back-from-the-dead-to-murder-you-with-robots-190238169.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Summer Game Fest 2022</a>, with promises that the game a) still existed and b) had been fully remade for the new generation of gaming hardware. If the current schedule holds, <em>Routine</em> will be on Steam and Xbox, including day one availability on Game Pass, by the end of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Aliens</em> vibes are strong in the brief release date teaser. Think film grain effects, janky gadgets and of course the looming threat of death around every corner. The player will explore an abandoned lunar base to try and figure out how everything went horribly wrong before your arrival. The answer seems to involve murderous robots that would make Weyland-Yutani proud.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/13-years-after-it-was-announced-sci-fi-horror-game-routine-has-a-release-date-of-december-4-205604793.html?src=rss
