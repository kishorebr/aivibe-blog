<p>SpaceX has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10">successfully launched</a> the Starship for its 10th test flight after it was delayed a couple of times due to weather conditions and other issues. This time, the company was able to achieve its objectives without the vehicle and its booster exploding mid-test. One of those objectives was deploying Starship&#39;s payload for the first time ever. If you&#39;ll recall, Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html">seventh</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-again-during-its-eighth-test-flight-140018375.html">eighth</a> test flights. The vehicle made it to space for its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-ninth-starship-test-flight-reaches-space-but-fails-to-deploy-fake-satellites-120057474.html">ninth test</a>, but it failed to deploy its fake satellite payload. In June, a Starship vehicle <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-on-the-ground-during-a-routine-test-130025133.html">exploded on the ground</a> while the company was preparing it for its 10th flight test.</p>
<p>The company had to use another upper stage, called Ship, for the 10th flight after that explosion. It also incorporated changes into the Ship and its Super Heavy booster, based on what it learned from those previous attempts. For this test, SpaceX intended to conduct several experiments with the booster, such as flipping it and playing with engine configurations as it made its way back down. Due to the experimental nature of this test, SpaceX didn&#39;t try to catch it with the launch tower&#39;s chopstick arms. Instead, it made a controlled descent into the Indian Ocean, where it exploded upon making contact with the water.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Ship continued flying into space. Around <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/private-spaceflight/spacex-launches-starship-flight-10-critical-test-flight-video">20 minutes after launch</a>, the upper stage started ejecting eight dummy Starlink satellites into space, before re-lighting one of its engines in flight as part of another test. After that, Ship started making its way back to Earth, where it also splashed down into the Indian Ocean a bit over an hour after launch. &quot;Congratulations to all of our teammates here at SpaceX — it’s been a year,&quot; SpaceX’s Dan Huot <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/science/live-news/spacex-starship-flight-10-launch-08-26-25">said</a> during the livestream, likely pointing out that it&#39;s been a while since the company has had a good test flight. Of course, SpaceX still has a long way to go, including having to figure out how to retrieve the vehicle&#39;s upper stage after a flight in order for the Starship to be fully reusable.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html?src=rss
