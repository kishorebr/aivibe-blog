<p>Warner Music Group (WMG) settled a lawsuit with an AI company in exchange for a piece of the action. The label <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investors.wmg.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/WARNER-MUSIC-GROUP-AND-UDIO-COLLABORATE-TO-BUILD-A-NEW-LICENSED-MUSIC-CREATION-SERVICE/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> on Wednesday that it had resolved <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/record-labels-sue-ai-music-generators-for-massive-infringement-of-recorded-music-172915925.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a 2024 lawsuit against AI music creation platform Udio</a>. As part of the deal, Udio gets to license Warner&#39;s catalog for an upcoming music creation service. This follows a similar <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-and-udio-announce-udios-first-strategic-agreements-for-new-licensed-ai-music-creation-platform/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">settlement</a> between Universal Music Group and Udio, announced last month.</p><p>Udio&#39;s service will allow subscribers to create, listen to and discover AI-generated music trained on licensed work. You’ll be able to generate new songs, remixes and covers using favorite artists&#39; voices or compositions. The boundaries between human creation and an algorithm&#39;s approximation of it are about to grow murkier. Not in terms of artistic quality, but it will be based on what proliferates online.</p><p>WMG is framing the deal as a win for artists, who will — if they choose to opt in — gain a new revenue stream. Ahead of the service’s launch, Udio will roll out &quot;expanded protections and other measures designed to safeguard the rights of artists and songwriters.&quot;</p><p>So, the settlement does at least appear to reassert some control over artists’ work. What the normalization of robot-made music will do for society&#39;s collective tastes is another question.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg" style="height:3975px;width:5955px;" alt="A neon sign on a wall, reading, &quot;You are what you listen to.&quot;" data-uuid="6dc487bf-745e-494e-9a1d-81b72e60107f"><figcaption>A neon sign on a wall, reading, &quot;You are what you listen to.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mohammad Metri / Unsplash</div></figure><p>The settlement echoes a warning Spotify <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotify-partners-with-the-big-three-music-labels-on-artist-first-ai-music-products-161047159.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">sounded to musicians and labels last month</a>. &quot;If the music industry doesn&#39;t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent or compensation,&quot; the company wrote. Spotify plans to launch &quot;artist-first AI music products&quot; in the future, a vague promise to be sure. However, given Udio&#39;s plans, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the streaming service cooking up a similar licensed AI music-creation product.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,&quot; Warner Music CEO Robert Kyncl wrote in a press release. &quot;This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI&#39;s potential - fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/warner-signs-ai-music-licensing-deal-with-udio-213433325.html?src=rss
