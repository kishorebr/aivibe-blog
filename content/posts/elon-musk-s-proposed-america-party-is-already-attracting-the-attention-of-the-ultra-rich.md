<p>Just a day after former White House advisor Elon Musk claimed on X that he's creating a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1941584569523732930">new political party</a> in the US, some deep-pocketed figures have offered support and potential interest. Replying to an X post that said the America Party would offer "independence from the two-party system," billionaire <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mcuban/status/1941612269051240470">Mark Cuban</a> and investment banker <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Scaramucci/status/1941604620947579060">Anthony Scaramucci</a> both replied to Musk, providing some possible next steps.</p>
<p>After celebrating the America Party announcement post with emojis, Cuban said that he works with the Center for Competitive Democracy and could help get Musk's party on ballots. Scaramucci also responded on X, saying he would "like to meet to discuss."</p>

<p>Scaramucci previously served as the White House communications director in 2017 during Trump's first term before being dismissed 10 days in. The former Trump ally has since crossed to the other side of the political aisle and supported both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential campaigns. Similarly, Cuban previously supported Harris and was even tied to the Democratic candidate as a potential running mate. While there are still plenty of questions about Musk's proposed political party that comes after a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/musk-appears-delete-posts-claiming-trump-epstein-files/story?id=122609304">hostile fallout</a> with Trump, the Tesla CEO's post on X indicated that it would focus on taking over "two or three Senate seats and eight to 10 House districts."</p>
<p>It's unclear if Musk has already filed the necessary paperwork to officially establish the America Party. The <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.fec.gov/data/filings/?data_type=efiling">latest filings</a> with the Federal Election Commission show several documents that reference Musk's new party, but the veracity of these is questionable, and they sit alongside a slew of apparent joke filings, including the "American Meme Party," "The Diddy Party" and "The DOGE Party."</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-proposed-america-party-is-already-attracting-the-attention-of-the-ultra-rich-170030496.html?src=rss
