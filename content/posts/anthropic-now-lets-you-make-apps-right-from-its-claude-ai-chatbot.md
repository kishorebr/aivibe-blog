<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic is adding a new feature to its Claude AI chatbot that lets you <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">build AI-powered apps</a> right inside the app. The upgrade, launching in beta, builds upon Anthropic’s Artifacts feature introduced last year that lets you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch">see and interact with</a> what you ask Claude to make.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Start building in the Claude app by enabling this new interactive capability,” the company says <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">in a blog post</a>. “Simply describe what you want to create, and Claude will write the code for you.” It basically sounds like vibe coding, but with the ability to see the results right inside Claude. You can briefly see how it all works in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBxwtabGltc">a video from Anthropic</a> that shows somebody building a chat app.</p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="Demo: Build a Claude-powered app" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBxwtabGltc?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Early users of the feature have built things like AI-powered games, learning tools, data analysis apps, writing assistants, and even agent workflows that “orchestrate multiple Claude calls for complex tasks,” Claude says. Apps will be able to “interact with Claude through an API.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic also wants people to share the apps that they make, and it’s encouraging that by making so that somebody else’s API usage of your app “counts against <em>their</em> subscription, not yours.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The feature is available on Anthropic’s Free, Pro, and Max tiers.</p>
