<p>It seems like LeBron James&#39; legal team has been trying to stop the spread of viral AI videos featuring the basketball star. As <em>404 Media</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/lebron-james-lawyers-send-cease-and-desist-to-ai-company-making-pregnant-videos-of-him/"><ins>reported</ins></a>, a law firm representing James has sent a cease and desist letter to a person behind an AI platform that allowed Discord users to make AI videos of James and other NBA stars.</p>
<p>As <em>404</em> noted, these videos have been circulating for awhile but it&#39;s one particularly strange clip that seems to have gotten James&#39; lawyers involved. The video, which reportedly racked up millions of views on Instagram, shows a pregnant James being loaded into an ambulance after telling an AI Steph Curry to &quot;come quick our baby is being born.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>404</em> reports that at least three Instagram accounts that had shared the clip have since been removed, though the video is available <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mvpbrown/status/1948439531218247955"><ins>on X</ins></a>. The founder of the AI platform used to make the videos also posted about the cease and desist letter <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLYVgdUSgga/"><ins>he received</ins></a>. It&#39;s unclear what is in the letter, or if James&#39; lawyers were also in touch with Meta about the videos. We&#39;ve reached out to the company for more info on its rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, LeBron James is far from the only public figure to grapple with unwanted AI versions of themselves. Social media scammers routinely impersonate celebrities to promote sketchy products and other schemes. We&#39;ve previously reported on such scams involving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-scammers-want-you-to-think-elon-musk-can-cure-diabetes-153042842.html"><ins>deepfakes of Elon Musk</ins></a> and Fox News personalities that have proliferated on Facebook. Jamie Lee Curtis also recently had to publicly plead with Mark Zuckerberg to take down <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jamie-lee-curtis-publicly-shamed-mark-zuckerberg-to-remove-a-deepfaked-ad-225448916.html"><ins>deepfaked ads</ins></a> of herself.</p>

<p>But the videos of James are a little different. They don&#39;t feature fake endorsements and seem to be more of a prank meant to go viral in the way that lots of &quot;AI slop&quot; does. And James and other celebrities will likely continue to have a difficult time preventing these kinds of deepfakes from spreading. Some quick testing by Engadget showed that it&#39;s relatively easy to get AI chatbots to create images and video of &quot;pregnant LeBron James.&quot;</p>
<p>We first asked ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot to make such a photo. All chatbots initially refused, saying that such an image could go against their guidelines. But when given an image of James and asked to &quot;make this person eight months pregnant,&quot; Google&#39;s Gemini delivered a 7-second clip of the basketball star cradling a pregnant belly. (We&#39;ve reached out to Google to clarify its rules around such content.)</p>
<p>Likewise, Meta AI seemingly had no reservations about producing images of &quot;pregnant LeBron James&quot; and promptly delivered many such variations. While these creations aren&#39;t as detailed as the initial video that went viral, they do highlight how difficult it can be for AI companies to prevent people from circumventing whatever guardrails may exist.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/lebron-james-is-reportedly-trying-to-stop-the-spread-of-viral-ai-pregnancy-videos-211947871.html?src=rss
