<p>Last year Dyson introduced the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/the-dyson-pencilvac-is-the-most-stick-like-stick-vacuum-ever-020109491.html"><ins>PencilVac</ins></a>, which it immediately declared the &quot;world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner.&quot; Presumably, then, the title of world’s slimmest wet floor cleaner goes to the newly unveiled PencilWash.</p>
<p>Promising a &quot;lighter, slimmer and smaller solution to wet cleaning without compromising on hygiene,&quot; the PencilWash is designed to let you clean everywhere you need to with minimal hassle. Like the vacuum cleaner with which it shares the first part of its name, the handle measures just 1.5 inches in diameter from top to bottom, and the whole thing weighs little more than 2kg.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ultra-thin design allows the cleaner to lie almost completely flat, allowing you to get into tight corners or under low furniture, where more traditionally bulky devices might struggle. Its slender proportions also make it easier to store if your home is on the smaller side.</p>
<p>Dyson says the PencilWash only applies fresh water to floors, and after swiftly eliminating spills and stains it should dry up pretty quickly. Its high-density microfiber roller is designed to tackle both wet and dry debris in one pass, and because it doesn’t have a traditional filter, you won’t have to worry about trapped dirt or lingering smells.</p>
<p>Above the power buttons there’s a screen displaying remaining battery level, and the handle can be slotted into a charging dock when not in use.</p>
<p>The Dyson PencilVac will cost $349, with a release date yet to be announced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dyson-announces-the-pencilwash-wet-floor-cleaner-230152299.html?src=rss
