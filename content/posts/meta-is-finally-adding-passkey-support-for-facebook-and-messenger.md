<p>Meta is finally adding <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/introducing-passkeys-facebook-easier-sign-in/">passkey support for Facebook and Messenger</a> on mobile devices. This should make for more seamless logins, as a passkey lets people sign in by using the same data they already use to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/passwords-vs-passkeys-what-you-need-to-know-175322074.html">verify their identities</a> on a smartphone. This includes stuff like a PIN code, a fingerprint or a quick face scan.</p>
<p>This is not only convenient, but more secure than traditional passwords. Passkeys are resistant to many types of malicious attacks, as they canâ€™t be easily guessed or stolen. This will vary depending on the type of passkey you use, as a four-digit PIN is easier to fake than a full face scan or a fingerprint.</p>

<p>Meta says this feature will be rolling out soon for Facebook on iOS and Android devices, but Messenger users will have to wait a bit longer. The company says that&#39;s headed our way &quot;in the coming months.&quot; However, the same passkey will work with both Facebook and Messenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook has been slow to adopt this login method. Google has <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-passkeys-can-now-sync-across-devices-on-multiple-platforms-160056596.html">offered this feature for years</a>, and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-adds-passkey-logins-for-android-users-231827149.html">X jumped on board last year</a>.
