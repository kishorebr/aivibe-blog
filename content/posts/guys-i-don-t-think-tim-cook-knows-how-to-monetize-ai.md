Apple exceeded expectations when it reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday, revealing that it made $143.8 billion in revenue for a 16% year-over-year increase. As analysts peppered CEO Tim Cook with softball questions during Apple’s earnings call, one analyst dared to ask the question that seemingly no one in Silicon Valley is willing to ask.

Ask anyone in tech how OpenAI is planning to break even, and you’ll be met with the verbal equivalent of the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ emoticon.

But good ol’ Tim “$143.8 billion in revenue” Cook was having a good afternoon, so maybe he’d finally spill the beans about how any of these companies are planning to recoup their investments.

His answer was disappointing.

“Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think
