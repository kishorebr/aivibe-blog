<p>Stop me if you've heard this one before: Microsoft is making it harder to use Chrome on Windows. The culprit? This time, it's <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-30-microsoft-family-safety-app-screen-time-locations.html">Windows' Family Safety feature</a>. Since early this month, the parental control measure has prevented users from opening Chrome. Strangely, no other apps or browsers appear to be affected.</p>
<p>Redditors first <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/1l2c552/chrome_wont_open_windows_11/">reported</a> the issue on June 3 (<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690179/microsoft-block-google-chrome-family-safety-feature">via</a> <em>The Verge</em>). u/Witty-Discount-2906 posted that Chrome crashed on Windows 11. "Just flashes quickly, unable to open with no error message," they wrote. Another user chimed in with a correct guess. "This may be related to Parental Controls," u/duk242 surmised. "I've had nine students come see the IT Desk in the last hour saying Chrome won't open."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Google spokesperson pointed Engadget to a statement in its community forum. "Our team has investigated these reports and determined the cause of this behavior," Community Manager Ellen T. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/348515764?hl=en&amp;msgid=351376637">wrote</a>. "For some users, Chrome is unable to run when Microsoft Family Safety is enabled."</p>
<p>Curiously, Microsoft hasn't fixed the bug after 17 days. (Go figure!)</p>

<p>Windows Family Safety is an optional parental control feature for families and schools. It lets them manage children's screen time, filter their web browsing and monitor their activity.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds while we wait for the company to take action. One is to turn off the "Filter Inappropriate Websites" setting in Family Safety. However, that removes the security feature, letting the kids run wild on the World Wide Web. (Weeee!!) A simpler fix is to navigate to your Chrome folder and rename <em>chrome.exe</em> to something like <em>chrome1.exe</em>.</p>
<p>Engadget emailed Microsoft for a comment. We haven't heard back, but we'll update this story if we do.</p>
<p>If you've ever installed Chrome on Windows, this bug may trigger deja vu. Microsoft has a long history of desperate tricks to keep you on its default products. That has included <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-12-windows-10-to-discourage-chrome-firefox-installs.html">obnoxious prompts</a>, pop-up <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-once-again-asking-chrome-users-to-try-bing-through-unblockable-pop-ups-184348202.html">ads for Bing</a> and begging users to stick with Edge. At least European users will get some relief. Microsoft is <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-edge-will-stop-begging-you-for-attention-in-europe-at-least-130038477.html">scaling back its cheap tactics</a> there to comply with EU regulations.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-parental-controls-are-blocking-chrome-170247515.html?src=rss
