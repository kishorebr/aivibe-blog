<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-videos-are-all-just-going-to-be-reels-now-185807805.html">Facebook</a> has been showing some users a pop-up message asking them if they want to allow the social network to create collages, recaps and AI restylings using photos they've yet to upload from their camera roll. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Facebook has been showing users the message when they upload a new Story on the app. It doesn't pop up for everyone, however, since we weren't able to replicate the event. In that notification, Meta wrote that in order to create ideas for users, it'll select media from their camera roll and upload it to the company's cloud "on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location and themes."</p>
<p>The message also said that the media won't be used for ads targeting, but its wording raised concerns about the possibility of Meta using people's camera roll files to train its artificial intelligence technology. Meta assued <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/694685/meta-ai-camera-roll"><em>The Verge</em></a> that it's not "currently training [its] AI models with these photos." The company's comms manager, Maria Cubeta, told the publication that Meta "testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person’s camera roll" as part of its efforts to explore ways to make content sharing easier. "These suggestions are opt-in only and only shown to you — unless you decide to share them — and can be turned off at any time. Camera roll media may be used to improve these suggestions, but are not used to improve AI models in this test," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The test feature has a limited reach, but it has been ongoing for some time, seeing as some users have reported seeing it earlier this year. In fact, Facebook already has a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Portal from Facebook;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=091efd15-4735-4282-b75d-cccd7aa0482b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;linkText=Help+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vaGVscC8xMjQzNDU5NDA2OTk2ODY5Lz9oZWxwcmVmPXVmX3NoYXJlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwOTFlZmQxNS00NzM1LTQyODItYjc1ZC1jY2NkN2FhMDQ4MmIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9oZWxwLzEyNDM0NTk0MDY5OTY4NjkvP2hlbHByZWY9dWZfc2hhcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdVAniP4PhJec3Cj_hc6Drm-jf-JiW1JRlnG4vsGLb0O&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1243459406996869%2F%3Fhelpref%3Duf_share" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.facebook.com/help/1243459406996869/?helpref=uf_share">Help page</a> for it, giving users instructions on how to allow and disallow "creative ideas with camera roll cloud processing" on Facebook. For those who've previously clicked Allow when the message popped up for them, they can go to Settings and switch it off in the "Camera roll sharing suggestions" section under Preferences.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/facebook-test-uses-meta-ai-to-process-photos-youve-yet-to-upload-140021100.html?src=rss
