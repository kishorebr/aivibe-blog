<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Meta&#39;s smart glasses plans were already one of the worst kept secrets, as there have been more than a year of leaks and reports about its work to add a heads-up display to the product. Now, just days before their unveiling at Connect, a promotional video of the new frames seems to have leaked.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The video, </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-hud-wristband-clips-leak/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=threads"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">reported</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> and </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@uploadvr/post/DOoWSnjjTHV"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">reposted</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> by <em>UploadVR</em>, shows the new &quot;Meta Ray-Ban Display&quot; frames as well as a new model of camera-enabled Oakley sunglasses. The clip mainly features the new Ray-Ban glasses, and shows a pair of black frames with clear lenses that look similar to the company&#39;s previous Wayfarer frames.&nbsp;</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/meta__smart_glasses_lineup.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/meta__smart_glasses_lineup.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Meta is adding two new pairs of glasses to its lineup." data-uuid="14a05647-bc6b-4fd4-b8d0-d1490b17a5d6"><figcaption>Meta is adding two new pairs of glasses to its lineup.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The glasses also include a small display that&#39;s able to show info like a map preview, chats with friends and information related to what you&#39;re looking at. As reported, it also shows a dedicated wristband for the device. The video briefly shows someone swiping with their fingers in order to type out a reply to a message in a chat app.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The clip also shows a new pair of Oakley frames that don&#39;t have a display. The sunglasses seem to be based on the company&#39;s wraparound Sphaera frames and show a camera in the center directly over the nosepiece.
