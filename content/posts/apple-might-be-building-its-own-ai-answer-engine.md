			Apple might be building its own AI ‘answer engine’

			
Apple has formed a new team to build a ChatGPT-like app, according to according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

This team — reportedly called Answers, Knowledge, and Information — is working to build an “answer engine” that can respond to questions using information from across the web. This could be a standalone app or provide search capabilities in Siri, Safari, and other Apple products.


	
	




	
	



Gurman also notes that Apple is advertising for jobs with this team, specifically looking for applicants who have experience with search algorithms and engine development.

While Apple has already integrated ChatGPT into Siri, a more personalized, AI-powered update to the voice assistant has been repeatedly delayed. Apple might also have to alter its search deal with Google as a result of the latter company’s antitrust defeat.
