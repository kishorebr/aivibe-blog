<p>X has finally revealed its long-promised chat platform, which replaces the service&#39;s basic DM functionality with features more like the messaging capabilities on other mainstream apps. The update adds voice and video calling, file sharing and the ability to edit and delete previously sent messages, as well as privacy-focused features like end-to-end encryption and screenshot notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>The overhauled messaging features, called Chat, are rolling out now on iOS and the web and will be &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/chat/status/1989465743256375724" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">coming soon</a>&quot; on Android, according to the company. X also said it&#39;s working on a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/chat/status/1989465744464384323" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">voice memo</a> feature for users to exchange audio messages.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Chat – all-new secure messaging on X.<br><br>• end-to-end encrypted chats and file sharing<br>• edit, delete, or make messages disappear<br>• block screenshots and get notified of attempts<br>• no ads. no tracking. total privacy. <a href="https://t.co/7dmDEDkYvO">pic.twitter.com/7dmDEDkYvO</a></p>— Chat (@chat) <a href="https://twitter.com/chat/status/1989465741444485180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>X has been teasing its new &quot;chat&quot; features for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-may-soon-replace-dms-with-its-upcoming-chat-platform-171006540.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">several months</a>. The company rolled out an early version of encrypted messaging earlier this year, but &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-pausing-encrypted-dms-215750222.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">paused</a>&quot; the feature in May to address unspecified issues. Now, it appears that X&#39;s encryption no longer has some of the limitations it initially did. An article on X&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://help.x.com/en/using-x/encrypted-direct-messages" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">help center</a> states that &quot;unlike before, group messages and media can now be encrypted,&quot; though it notes that associated metadata (including information about the recipient) is not encrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>X also states that &quot;we do not offer protections against man-in-the-middle attacks,&quot; which could compromise an encrypted chat. &quot;As a result, if someone—a malicious insider or X itself as a result of a compulsory legal process—were to compromise an encrypted conversation, neither the sender or receiver would know,&quot; the company explains. X says it&#39;s working on features that will help users verify the authenticity of encrypted conversations.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-finally-rolling-out-chat-its-dm-replacement-with-encryption-and-video-calling-233032571.html?src=rss
