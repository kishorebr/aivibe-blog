<p>Logitech is hoping to attract all the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/build-custom-keyboard-130021619.html">keebheads</a> out there with its latest Alto Keys K98M. While this keyboard has been available in Asian markets for a while, Logitech finally brought its customizable work keyboard to the US. It may appeal to a specific demographic, but it&#39;s a welcome return to hot-swappable offerings from Logitech. The Alto Keys K98M is now available in US markets through its website for $119.</p>
<p>According to Logitech, the Alto Keys K98M comes with hot-swappable Logi Marble linear switches. While Logitech sells several <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-mechanical-hands-on-gamer-switches-meet-premium-productivity-070109417.html">mechanical keyboards</a>, the last notable one with a hot-swappable board was the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-logitech-mechanical-keyboard-switches.html">Logitech G Pro X</a> from 2019. Now, Logitech wants to dive back into the hardcore side of the keyboard world with something that&#39;s more tailored for the workspace. Instead of obnoxious <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-tiny-g-pro-x-60-gaming-keyboard-has-some-big-competition-070154542.html">RGB lighting</a>, the Alto Keys K98M features a translucent frame that&#39;s paired with white backlighting. For long days, the keyboard has a UniCushion design, where the full frame gasket mount absorbs typing vibrations for an improved feel and sound.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For customizability beyond switches, Logitech included three action keys that can be programmed for whatever you need. The first three F keys also work as Easy-Switch buttons that let you cycle between up to three devices. The Alto Keys K98M works wirelessly through Bluetooth and is compatible with Windows, macOS, ChromeOS and iPadOS. Logitech said that the keyboard will get up to a year of wireless use if you keep the backlighting off. When the Alto Keys K98M&#39;s battery runs low, you can continue using it as you recharge it through the USB-C port.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/logitech-is-going-after-keyboard-snobs-with-the-hot-swappable-alto-keys-k98m-031051209.html?src=rss
