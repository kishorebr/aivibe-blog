<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/another-big-car-company-gives-up-on-hydrogen-133011978.html"><ins>Stellantis</ins></a> — the parent of several auto brands including Dodge, Ram and Chrysler — said customers&#39; personal information was included in a data breach. The automaker said <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27079"><ins>in a statement</ins></a> that &quot;contact information&quot; was procured, but not &quot;financial or sensitive personal&quot; data, as that is not stored on the third-party platform that was breached.</p>
<p>&quot;We recently detected unauthorized access to a third-party service provider’s platform that supports our North American customer service operations,&quot; Stellantis said. &quot;Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols, initiated a comprehensive investigation and took prompt action to contain and mitigate the situation. We are also notifying the appropriate authorities and directly informing affected customers.&quot; The company encouraged customers to be on guard against phishing and social engineering attacks, and to be careful about sharing personal information with anyone who contacts them unexpectedly.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stellantis has not disclosed what types of contact information were involved in the breach, how many customers were affected or whether it&#39;s offering them privacy or credit protection services. A spokesperson told Engadget the automaker is &quot;not providing any additional information beyond our statement.&quot;</p>
