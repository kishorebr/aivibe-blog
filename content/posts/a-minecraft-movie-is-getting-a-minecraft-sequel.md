<p>If Hollywood has taught us anything, it&#39;s that a blockbuster that makes bank <em>will</em> get a sequel (or seven). Enter <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, with its surprisingly effective humor and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-just-set-a-new-record-with-the-biggest-opening-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation-in-the-us-192934482.html">$957 million box office payday</a>. (Who had &quot;Jack Black will anchor a nearly billion-dollar movie&quot; on their 2025 bingo card?) So, it&#39;s no surprise that Warner Bros. has officially <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/minecraft/status/1976342404761518252">greenlit</a> a sequel.</p>
<p><em>Variety</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/minecraft-2-release-date-july-2027-1236544541/">reports</a> that Warner Bros. has penciled in the sequel for a July 23, 2027, premiere date. That would place it around two years after the original, which is the second-highest-grossing film of the year so far. (Disney&#39;s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is in first, with a cool $1.03 billion at the box office.)</p>

<p>The sequel will reportedly bring back director Jared Hess. The <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> creator will also co-write the screenplay with Chris Galletta. Producers are said to include Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Roy Lee, Eric McLeod, Kayleen Walters, Torfi Frans Ã“lafsson and Jason Momoa.</p>
<p>Engadget was among the many publications taken aback by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-its-good-actually-190035499.html">how good <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> was</a>. After all, a film about an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-11-minecraft-explainer.html">open-ended building game</a>, starring one of the leads of <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-borderlands-movie-is-an-astounding-waste-of-potential-160032875.html">the crummy <em>Borderlands</em></a>, didn&#39;t sound promising. But we found it surprisingly funny, with just the right degree of winking self-awareness. On top of that, Devindra Hardawar said it &quot;delivers a decent message about championing creativity in a world that wants to beat down free-thinking non-conformists.&quot; Amen to that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-is-getting-a-minecraft-sequel-203509569.html?src=rss
