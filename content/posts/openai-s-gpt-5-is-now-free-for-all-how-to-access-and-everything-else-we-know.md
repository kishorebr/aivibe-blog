    OpenAI's GPT-5 is now free for all: How to access and everything else we know
     
    We're testing GPT-5 and will have more to share next week. Here's what we know about OpenAI's GPT-5 so far.

The advantages of the former, such as GPT-4o, are that they combine speed and accuracy, while reasoning models such as o3 and o4 take longer to think and use more compute power to produce better answers. OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, supposedly gives all users access to the best of both models. Also: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)On Thursday, OpenAI finally unveiled the long-awaited GPT-5, the company's next-generation family of models, which it touts as the fastest, smartest, and most capable yet. GPT-5 is a unified system that combines a smart model for most queries and a deeper reasoning model (GPT-5 thinking) for harder problems. If you are wondering exactly what it does and if you should even consider trying it, keep reading. What is GPT-5?The key differentiator between GPT-5 and other OpenAI models is the real router feature, which allows GPT-5 to automatically understand which model to use based on the conversation, the complexity of the prompt, and more. The router is continuously trained on real signals to understand t
