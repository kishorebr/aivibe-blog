<p>CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it&#39;s much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPN</a> list because it&#39;s so cheap, but I wouldn&#39;t have done that if it didn&#39;t earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all.</p>
<p>My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that&#39;s not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that&#39;s not a bad thing — especially at such a low price.</p>
<p>Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it&#39;s got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I&#39;ll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-cyberghost">Installing, configuring and using CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost gets installation and UI largely right. There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don&#39;t overload you with needless information. I&#39;ve broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3>
<p>CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn&#39;t even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault.</p>

<p>Once inside, you&#39;re greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it&#39;s not broken, don&#39;t fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn&#39;t open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name.</p>
<p>To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can&#39;t argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3>
<p>The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It&#39;s best to download directly from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYX7tTagjB-oRngJXvg0K0XJtWIMFT26Kdu8C0caoEyb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a>, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers.</p>
<p>Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it&#39;s in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there&#39;s not much reason to ever leave it pinned.</p>

<p>The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it&#39;s permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list.</p>
<p>Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab.</p>

<p>Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn&#39;t give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-android">Android</h3>
<p>CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It&#39;s nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I&#39;d clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren&#39;t too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn&#39;t do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. &quot;Anonymous statistics&quot; and &quot;Share network data for troubleshooting&quot; sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting.</p>
<p>Still, I&#39;m nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost&#39;s Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren&#39;t necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3>
<p>Much like its Android app, CyberGhost&#39;s iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest.</p>

<p>The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won&#39;t find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location.</p>
<p>However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">how a VPN works</a>. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they&#39;re no substitute for a full VPN. They&#39;re free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don&#39;t get caught, but they aren&#39;t secure.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-speed-test">CyberGhost speed test</h2>
<p>I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here&#39;s what each metric means in the table below:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p><strong>Ping, </strong>measured in <strong>milliseconds (ms), </strong>is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Download speed, </strong>measured in <strong>megabits per second (Mbps), </strong>is what you probably think of as &quot;internet speed&quot; — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Upload speed, </strong>also measured in <strong>Mbps, </strong>determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It&#39;s useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls.</p></li>

<p>CyberGhost&#39;s speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost&#39;s 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Surfshark</a>, currently the fastest VPN overall.</p>

<p>Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s.</p>
<p>As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It&#39;s just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-security-test">CyberGhost security test</h2>
<p>VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it&#39;s using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it&#39;s being applied equally to all data packets. Let&#39;s get started.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3>
<p>CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. <strong>OpenVPN, </strong>available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. <strong>WireGuard, </strong>supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. <strong>IKEv2, </strong>which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn&#39;t open-source.</p>
<p>I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn&#39;t make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can&#39;t complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3>
<p>I used <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a> to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak).</p>

</figure>
<p>CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there&#39;s no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn&#39;t find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server&#39;s IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn&#39;t leaking.</p>
<p>There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It&#39;s annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3>
<p>For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-much-does-cyberghost-cost">How much does CyberGhost cost?</h2>
<p>CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" style="height:1576px;width:3418px;" alt="These prices are subject to change." data-uuid="99bfda39-6767-47ff-bcd8-00601369b0a7">
 <figcaption>

<p>One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That&#39;s still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-side-apps-and-bundles">CyberGhost side apps and bundles</h2>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that&#39;s honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it&#39;s nice to see a VPN that&#39;s content with just being a VPN.</p>
<p>CyberGhost does have a broader &quot;security suite,&quot; but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the &quot;Extra features&quot; section below.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-dedicated-ip">Dedicated IP</h3>
<p>You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you&#39;ll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It&#39;s also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-close-reading-cyberghosts-privacy-policy">Close-reading CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy</h2>
<p>CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It&#39;s not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That&#39;s a great start, but to be certain about a company&#39;s approach to privacy, it&#39;s best to look at its own words.</p>
<p>A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don&#39;t go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption.</p>
<p>When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it&#39;s not in their interest to lie outright in the document.</p>
<p>I went over CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=here&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5cG9saWN5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3ByaXZhY3lwb2xpY3kifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASYbXwLN1vzWv2OcswQUEfLaywO4SqmgX5b_74w4QCmU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacypolicy" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacypolicy">here</a> if you&#39;d like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of &quot;uncompromising protection&quot;: CyberGhost swears that &quot;<strong>we are NOT storing</strong> connection logs, meaning that <strong>we DON&#39;T have</strong> any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration&quot; (all emphasis theirs).</p>
<p>That&#39;s the standard I&#39;ll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let&#39;s see how it holds up.</p>

<p>The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN.</p>
<p>Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are &quot;fraud detection/prevention&quot; and &quot;To enforce the terms of service,&quot; but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government.</p>
<p>The only potential problem comes in the section titled &quot;Sharing Your Personal Data.&quot; Here, CyberGhost states that &quot;we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,&quot; meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won&#39;t rehash the case against Kape in full — my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">ExpressVPN review</a> covers it in detail.</p>
<p>Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn&#39;t a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn&#39;t own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won&#39;t share information with any entity not &quot;located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.&quot; Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn&#39;t have. It&#39;s not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn&#39;t a problem; it&#39;s just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it&#39;s located.</p>
<p>To sum up, I didn&#39;t see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I&#39;m confident that using this VPN doesn&#39;t risk your personal privacy.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-independent-corroboration">Independent corroboration</h3>
<p>CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=again+in+2024&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5aHViL3ByaXZhY3ktYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeWh1Yi9wcml2YWN5LWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQqglCsIonIccFpaZHW6KnhW7P-QW7kU2nCRfgJGNXoY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacyhub%2Fprivacy-audit-2024%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacyhub/privacy-audit-2024/">again in 2024</a>. Following that pattern, I&#39;ll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it&#39;s only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost&#39;s systems that conflicted with its privacy policy.</p>
<p>The audit notes CyberGhost&#39;s server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn&#39;t see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers.</p>
<p>CyberGhost also posts a regular <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=transparency+report&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS90cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktcmVwb3J0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3RyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS1yZXBvcnQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbIOdcmaiBYXn6RqiuhzeQMEbgLLJjp-Y4S6KeT9EbvV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Ftransparency-report" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/transparency-report">transparency report</a> that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information.

<h2 id="jump-link-can-cyberghost-change-your-virtual-location">Can CyberGhost change your virtual location?</h2>
<p>For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">virtual location changes</a> are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn&#39;t happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem.</p>
<p>Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-investigating-cyberghosts-server-network">Investigating CyberGhost&#39;s server network</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost&#39;s VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That&#39;s good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are.</p>

<p>Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you&#39;re likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There&#39;s a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia.</p>

</figure>
<p>The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you&#39;re using CyberGhost in Argentina, don&#39;t expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it&#39;s actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost&#39;s support center does include <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/214495965-CyberGhost-VPN-s-Virtual-Server-Locations" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">a list</a> of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it&#39;s not up to date.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-extra-features-of-cyberghost">Extra features of CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">NordVPN</a>, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost&#39;s offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn&#39;t matter as much if the features work well. Let&#39;s see how they do.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3>
<p>CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it&#39;s fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired.</p>
<p>Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it&#39;s still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It&#39;s an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user&#39;s control.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3>
<p>Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds.</p>
<p>CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It&#39;s limited, but works as advertised.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-optimized-servers">Optimized servers</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: &quot;For gaming,&quot; &quot;For torrenting,&quot; &quot;For streaming&quot; and &quot;NoSpy.&quot; Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn&#39;t see much difference between them and the normal servers.</p>
<p>&quot;For torrenting&quot; is called &quot;For downloading&quot; on Mac, but it&#39;s all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great.</p>

 </div>
</figure>
<p>Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it&#39;s important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming.</p>
<p>Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost&#39;s own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who&#39;s running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That&#39;s relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn&#39;t insist on high standards from collaborators.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-content-blocker">Content blocker</h3>
<p>CyberGhost&#39;s content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There&#39;s no customization like you get with Windscribe&#39;s R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it&#39;s getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn&#39;t test it in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-smart-rules">Smart Rules</h3>
<p>The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost&#39;s features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost&#39;s behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs.</p>
<figure>

 <figcaption>

 </div>
</figure>
<p>Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It&#39;s at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-customer-support-options">CyberGhost customer support options</h2>
<p>CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://support.cyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">support.cyberghostvpn.com</a> or by going through the app. If you choose the options &quot;CyberGhost VPN help&quot; or &quot;FAQ&quot; in the app settings, you&#39;ll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page.</p>
<p>The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I&#39;m having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for &quot;connection issues macos&quot; turned up 72 results, including one called &quot;Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS&quot; and another titled &quot;Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.&quot; These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn&#39;t been checked since.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-live-support-experience">Live support experience</h3>
<p>If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cyberghostvpnsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">a Zendesk portal</a>. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply.</p>
<p>Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://cyberghost.com" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghost.com</a> by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a &quot;CyberGhost AI Assistant&quot; (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don&#39;t — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn&#39;t working for them.</p>

<p>I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn&#39;t.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-background-check">CyberGhost background check</h2>
<p>CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it&#39;s still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can&#39;t find much information about its history — it doesn&#39;t even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn&#39;t court controversy. Still, I&#39;m naturally paranoid, so I&#39;d understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN.</p>
<p>There is precisely one date in CyberGhost&#39;s history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn&#39;t measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a &quot;malware distributor&quot;; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector.</p>
<p>Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn&#39;t make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not here to defend Kape — I&#39;m just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn&#39;t backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape&#39;s consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Private Internet Access</a>, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It&#39;s up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost&#39;s parent company presents a hard line you won&#39;t cross.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>
<p>At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I&#39;m definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it&#39;s not pushing any envelopes, but it&#39;s cheap and it does the job.</p>
<p>All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It&#39;ll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss
