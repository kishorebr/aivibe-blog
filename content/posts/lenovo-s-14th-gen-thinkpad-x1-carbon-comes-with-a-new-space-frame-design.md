The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 11 Aura Edition come with a new design the company has dubbed “Space Frame.” </p><p>Lenovo calls Space Frame an “engineering breakthrough” and describes it as a design that restructures the interior of a laptop, so that components are placed on both sides of the motherboard.

It comes with replaceable USB ports, battery, keyboard speakers and fans for easier repairs, and it also gives Lenovo enough room to equip laptops with a larger haptic touchpad.</p><p>In addition to having the Space Frame design, both ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 2-in-1 Aura Editions are Microsoft Copilot+ PCs powered by the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processors,</a> which also debuted at CES. The processors ship with 12Xe graphic cores and integrated NPUs for AI acceleration. Both models also introduce  a new 10MP camera with a 110-degree-wide field of view that features advanced distortion correction. As for the ThinkPad X1 2-in-1, it ships with a new magnetically docked pen that was designed to be ergonomic. </p><p>The company has announced the ThinkPad X9 15p Aura Edition at the event, as well.
