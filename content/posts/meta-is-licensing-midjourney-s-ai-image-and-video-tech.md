<p>Meta has signed a partnership with Midjourney, an AI service that can generate images and videos from text prompts. According to Alexandr Wang, Meta&#39;s Chief AI Officer, Meta is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/1958983843169673367">licensing</a> Midjourney&#39;s &quot;aesthetic technology&quot; for its future models and products. &quot;To ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach. This means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry,&quot; Wang added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company previously launched its own <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-ai-image-generator-is-available-as-a-standalone-website-185953058.html">AI image generator</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-launches-a-surreal-ai-video-editor-173907584.html">AI video editor</a>, but Midjourney&#39;s technology could help Meta offer services that can actually compete with rivals&#39;, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-video-generation-ai-model-arrives-globally-later-today-182613208.html">OpenAI&#39;s Sora</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-3-ai-model-can-generate-videos-with-sound-174541183.html">Google&#39;s Veo</a>. Midjourney made <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/midjourney-launches-its-new-v7-ai-image-model-that-can-process-text-prompts-better-134546883.html">V7</a> its default model for image generation back in June. It described V7 as an &quot;entirely new&quot; AI image generation model that&#39;s much smarter at processing text prompts than its predecessors. It also released its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.midjourney.com/updates/introducing-our-v1-video-model">V1 video model</a>, which allows users to turn the images they generate into a short animated video, at the same time. &quot;We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney. They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them,&quot; Wang said on X.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This partnership is but Meta&#39;s latest move in its quest to form a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-reportedly-forming-an-ai-superintelligence-team-133030015.html">Superintelligence laboratory</a> and become a major player in the AI sphere. Mark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spreed and managed to convince several key players from rivals to join his company instead by offering them massive salaries and signing bonuses.
