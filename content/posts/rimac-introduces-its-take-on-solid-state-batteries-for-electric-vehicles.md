<p>Rimac Technology has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.rimac-newsroom.com/press-releases/rimac-technology/rimac-technology-unveils-new-solid-state-battery-tech-and-next-generation-eaxles">unveiled</a> a new battery pack platform for electric vehicles that uses only solid-state batteries. The company has been an EV supplier for notable car brands including Aston Martin and Koenigsegg, as well as making electric supercar <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rimac-nevera-electric-hypercar-133154887.html"><ins>Nevara</ins></a>. Rimac collaborated with ProLogium and Mitsubishi Chemical Group on the product, which it claims will offer a lighter, safer and more energy-dense EV battery. It introduced this tech, alongside new composite and hybrid battery EV developments, at the IAA Mobility 2025 event.</p>
<p>Solid-state batteries are being touted as an important new development for EVs. European R&amp;D operation Imec released a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/solid-state-battery-prototype-boosts-energy-density-by-nearly-25-percent-080057028.html"><ins>study</ins></a> into this tech last year that backed claims that these batteries did indeed have the potential to improve efficiency while bringing down costs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the commercial development of solid-state batteries has been slow going. Despite a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-18-bmw-develop-solid-state-ev-batteries.html"><ins>flurry</ins></a> of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-14-dyson-ev-solid-state-batteries.html"><ins>partnerships</ins></a> several years ago, the targets for getting EVs fully powered by the tech onto the road may still be some time away. For instance, Nissan said it aims to have its first EV solely using solid-state batteries released by its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-solid-state-battery-ev-release-date-182025167.html"><ins>2028</ins></a> fiscal year. Rimac didn&#39;t offer even a rough timeline for when it might have its new battery tech available for customers.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rimac-introduces-its-take-on-solid-state-batteries-for-electric-vehicles-215915664.html?src=rss
