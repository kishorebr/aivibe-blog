<p>We&#39;re still waiting for Apple CarPlay compatibility for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-launches-a-seven-seat-version-of-the-2026-model-y-130039385.html">Tesla EVs</a>, but it&#39;s been pushed back thanks to a slight hitch with iOS 26, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&#39;s Mark Gurman. In the latest Power On newsletter, Gurman said that Tesla&#39;s plans to adopt CarPlay have been delayed due to app compatibility issues as well as low adoption rates for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-customize-your-iphone-home-screen-with-ios-26-130000798.html">iOS 26</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long wait for Tesla drivers who want CarPlay compatibility, especially since initial rumors indicated a late 2025 rollout and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-reportedly-testing-apple-carplay-in-its-vehicles-192505635.html"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported that Tesla was testing CarPlay in its vehicles in November. However, Gurman&#39;s latest newsletter revealed that there were some compatibility issues between Apple Maps and Tesla&#39;s in-house navigation software, which also supports the self-driving features.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To address this, Apple released an iOS 26 update that would better synchronize the two navigation apps, especially when a driver would use Tesla&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-full-self-driving-is-switching-to-a-subscription-only-service-120053137.html">autonomous driving options</a>. Still, Tesla is reportedly concerned enough about the low adoption rates of iOS 26 to delay delivering CarPlay to its vehicles. Gurman also noted that iOS 26 adoption rates were lower than usual, but are already going up, citing Apple&#39;s latest numbers that 74 percent of all iPhones released in the last four years are running iOS 26.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#39;s still no official date for when CarPlay arrives in Teslas, but including the beloved in-car feature could be a way to boost sales for the company. According to the January<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/tesla-u-s-sales-fall-for-fourth-straight-month-in-january"> registration estimates</a> in the US, Tesla saw sales slip for the fourth month in a row.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-carplay-is-coming-but-its-reportedly-being-held-back-by-low-ios-26-adoption-numbers-173812736.html?src=rss
