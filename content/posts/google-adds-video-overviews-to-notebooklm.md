<p>NotebookLM, the Google research tool that gained notoriety for its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-talks-up-notebooklm-upgrades-by-making-it-talk-up-google-io-2025-114240186.html">AI-generated podcasts</a>, is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-video-overviews-studio-upgrades/">introducing a feature called Video Overviews</a>. As the name suggests, this tool automatically creates videos on requested topics and pulls data from a user&#39;s uploaded images, diagrams, quotes and documents.</p>
<p>It&#39;s rolling out right now, but there are some caveats. These overviews are only available in English, though Google says more languages are on the way. Also, the tool doesn&#39;t make videos in a conventional sense. It creates slideshows with narration.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ac1f7fd4062e4fa3887f40420562f77c"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KA_pExdDSUo?si=5xmtMKsxKeRCNwxF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Despite this limitation, the company says the feature is &quot;uniquely effective for explaining data, demonstrating processes and making abstract concepts more tangible.&quot; Google also says it&#39;ll be expanding the toolset in the future, so it won&#39;t always be just a slideshow machine.</p>
<p>Video Overviews do currently offer some handy playback options. There&#39;s the ability to skip back and forth by 10 seconds and adjust the playback speed. The company is also updating NotebookLM&#39;s Studio tab. It&#39;s getting a visual refresh, which rolls out &quot;over the next few weeks&quot; to all users.</p>
<p>Google has certainly been busy iterating on the platform these past few months. It released an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/notebooklm-the-acceptable-face-of-google-ai-is-getting-an-app-in-may-182041294.html">official NotebookLM app</a> back in May and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-featured-notebooks-on-selected-topics-to-notebooklm-181400251.html">began offering</a> curated &quot;featured notebooks&quot; earlier this month. This lets users experiment with the platform with pre-approved topics like William Shakespeare, so newbies won&#39;t have to actually upload anything. Audio-only overviews are also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJg37fVPy9I">now available in over 50 languages</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-video-overviews-to-notebooklm-181524866.html?src=rss
