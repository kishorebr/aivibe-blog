<p>If you&#39;ve been wondering what&#39;s next for Netflix&#39;s <em>Terminator Zero </em>in the time since its first season, we finally have an update, and it&#39;s a bummer. Responding to a fan on social media, showrunner <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/mattsontomlin/status/2022206384352506048?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Mattson Tomlin</a> said this weekend that the show has been canceled. Despite being generally well received, Tomlin noted that &quot;at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="width:608px;height:996px;width:640px;height:996px;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was cancelled. The critical and audience reception to it was tremendous, but at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it. I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in season’s 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is. <a href="https://t.co/Dh7G6gkBF7">https://t.co/Dh7G6gkBF7</a> <a href="https://t.co/dqCSXHIytg">pic.twitter.com/dqCSXHIytg</a></p>— mattson tomlin (@mattsontomlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattsontomlin/status/2022206384352506048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></blockquote>


</div><p>Season one of <em>Terminator Zero </em>was released in August 2024 and focused on the events around Judgment Day — August 29, 1997, as established in <em>Terminator 2 —</em> and its aftermath, jumping forward to 2022, more than two decades into a war between humans and machines. In the post about the show&#39;s cancellation, Tomlin wrote, &quot;I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in season’s 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is.&quot;</p><p>Tomlin went on to praise the marketing team in additional <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/mattsontomlin/status/2022363247249363209?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">replies</a> for &quot;trying to really make the show work,&quot; as well as the hundreds of people who worked on the show. Offering a bit of insight, Tomlin <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/mattsontomlin/status/2022360742134190406?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">wrote</a>, &quot;Generally speaking, anime audiences skew younger. Terminator audiences skew older. <em>Terminator Zero</em> asked them to meet in the middle, and they didn’t in the way the corporation needed to justify the spend to continue. I’m extremely grateful to the people who have watched it.&quot;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/terminator-zero-showrunner-confirms-the-netflix-anime-has-been-canceled-after-one-season-211656840.html?src=rss
