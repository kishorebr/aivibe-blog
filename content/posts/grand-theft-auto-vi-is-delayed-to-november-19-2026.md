<p>Fans will have to wait a bit longer to return to Vice City. Rockstar Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>has been delayed once again to November 19, 2026. The open world game was previously delayed from its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2025 launch</a> window to May 26, 2026 <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">earlier this year.</a><br><br>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar said on its official X account.

</div><p>Take-Two, <em>GTA VI</em>’s publisher, does not appear particularly worried about the delay. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">an interview with <em>The Game Business</em></a><em>. </em>“We feel really good about this release date. It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.”</p><p><em>GTA V</em> was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-31-grand-theft-auto-5-release-date-september-17.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">originally released</a> in 2013, and has been rereleased multiple times in the years that followed for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-12-grand-theft-auto-ps4-xbox-one-pc.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">two generations</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-v-ps5-xbox-series-x-release-date-142203171.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">of consoles</a>. The games remains incredibly popular, which is part of the reason Take-Two seems so certain about the sequel. It helps that <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>, a multiplayer mode for <em>GTA V </em>that can also be downloaded as a standalone game, is itself a hit. “We continue to supply content to <em>GTA Online</em>, and in fact we’ve had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it’s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And <em>GTA V </em>has sold in more than 220 million units,” Zelnick said.<br><br>The long wait for a new GTA hasn’t been without controversy. The game <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-confirms-gta-vi-leak-143918535.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">leaked extensively</a> in 2022, revealing that it would feature a female protagonist, a fact that was later confirmed in the first official trailer. And while Rockstar Games has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">reportedly attempted</a> to improve its company culture since <em>GTA V</em> came out, the developer is currently being accused of union busting in the UK.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html?src=rss
