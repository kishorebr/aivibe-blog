<p>Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/veo-updates-flow/" data-i13n="slk:has released;cpos:1;pos:1">has released</a> a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google&#39;s Gemini API and is now also powering the company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-filmmaking-tool-flow-ai-generated-video-175212520.html" data-i13n="slk:Flow video editor;cpos:2;pos:1">Flow video editor</a>.</p><p>Veo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-3-ai-model-can-generate-videos-with-sound-174541183.html" data-i13n="slk:Veo 3;cpos:3;pos:1">Veo 3</a> at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html" data-i13n="slk:Google I/O 2025;cpos:4;pos:1">Google I/O 2025</a>. The new model offers better &quot;prompt adherence,&quot; according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image &quot;ingredients&quot; you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn&#39;t available with Veo 3.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I06Ef8alr2Y?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls &quot;Frame to Video,&quot; Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html" data-i13n="slk:a similar feature in Firefly;cpos:5;pos:1">a similar feature</a>, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor&#39;s ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.</p><p>Based on the samples Google&#39;s shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it&#39;s missing some of the realism of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html" data-i13n="slk:OpenAI&#39;s Sora 2;cpos:6;pos:1">OpenAI&#39;s Sora 2</a>, though, the company&#39;s decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-31-is-better-at-generating-videos-from-images-220829129.html?src=rss
