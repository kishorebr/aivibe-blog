<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, it's becoming easier to say which AI startups <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> <em>hasn't</em> looked at acquiring.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to <strong>Ilya Sutskever's</strong> <a href="https://ssi.inc/">Safe Superintelligence</a> (SSI), sources tell me the Meta CEO recently discussed buying ex-OpenAI CTO <strong>Mira Murati's</strong> <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/">Thinking Machines Lab</a> and Perplexity, the AI-native Google rival.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, details about the team Zuckerberg is assembling are starting to come into view: SSI co-founder and CEO <strong>Daniel Gross,</strong> along with ex-Github CEO <strong>Nat Friedman,</strong> are poised to co-lead the Meta AI assistant. Both men will report to <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, the former Scale CEO Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/685711/meta-scale-ai-ceo-alexandr-wang">just paid over $14 billion to quickly hire</a>. Wang told his Scale team goodbye last Friday and was in the Meta office on Monday. This week, he has been meeting with top Meta leaders (more on that below) and continuing to recruit for the new AI team Zuckerberg has tasked him with building. I expect the team to be unveiled as soon as next week. </p>
