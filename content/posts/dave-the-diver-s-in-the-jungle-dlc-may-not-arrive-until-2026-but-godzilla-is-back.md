<p><em>Dave the Diver</em> just marked its two-year anniversary, and the team behind it has a bunch of updates to share about its future. While it's mostly good news, there is one little hiccup: the upcoming <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ZsbGrCQ58"><em><ins>In the Jungle DLC</ins></em></a>, which was announced a few months ago and was expected to arrive later this year, now isn't likely to launch until 2026. But everything else announced in the 11-minute anniversary video should make up for it. That includes the return of the time-limited <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/dave-the-diver-is-bringing-godzilla-with-him-to-ps5-this-spring-233136441.html"><ins>free</ins><em><ins> Godzilla</ins></em><ins> DLC</ins></a>, which is now back on all platforms until at least the end of 2026. If you missed out on it the first time, here's your chance.</p>

<p>Mintrocket Studio Head Jaeho Hwang also said the team is extending the availability of the recent DLC, <em>Ichiban's Holiday</em>, which will remain available through next year as well. After hearing feedback from fans about the pricing, that pack will get "regular discounts" to make it cheaper.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game just landed on the Epic Games Store and according Hwang, a free upgrade for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is coming "in a few months" and will bring a higher frame rate. More info on that is coming soon, Hwang said. In the meantime, you can catch a sneak peek of <em>In the Jungle</em> about four minutes into the anniversary video.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dave-the-divers-in-the-jungle-dlc-may-not-arrive-until-2026-but-godzilla-is-back-203019821.html?src=rss
