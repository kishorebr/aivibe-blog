When former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).

While the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  


	
	




	
	



The latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. 

But it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. 

Or, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” 

The founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. 

Reaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.
