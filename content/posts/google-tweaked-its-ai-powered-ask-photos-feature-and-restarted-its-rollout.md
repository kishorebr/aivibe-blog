<p>Google <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/updates-ask-photos-search/">has improved</a> its AI-powered Ask Photos feature and is restarting its rollout to eligible users in the US. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-has-paused-the-ask-photos-rollout-182409437.html">paused the launch</a> of Ask Photos in early June over issues with latency and the feature's interface.</p>
<p>To make Ask Photos speedier, especially on simple searches for dogs or people, Google says its essentially combining the old Google Photos search with Ask Photos. While Google's Gemini models work in the background, the app can now quickly return basic image recognition-based results for searches. Once the more complex Gemini responses are complete, they're automatically displayed.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ask-google-photos-to-get-help-making-sense-of-your-gallery-170734062.html">Announced at Google I/O 2024</a>, Ask Photos uses AI to let you search through your Google Photos library with natural language queries. Besides structuring results as a chat, Google imagines the featuring being useful for sourcing information that you might not even realize your photo library is storing. You could search for your license plate number, for example, or the restaurant you visited on a specific birthday.</p>
<p>Google started rolling out Ask Photos <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-powered-photo-search-arrives-in-early-access-160041679.html">in September 2024</a>, though the early version of the feature was annoying to deal with. Besides being slow to return responses, it also replaced the faster, more traditional search in the app's menu bar. If you want to access normal search results you have to tap through multiple layers of the Google Photos interface. The new approach splits the difference by combining the results.</p>
<p>Ask Photos is once again rolling out to Google Photos eligible users. In order to receive the new feature, you need to be at least 18 years old, based in the US, have a Google Account with the language set to English and have the Google Photos "Face Groups" feature turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-tweaked-its-ai-powered-ask-photos-feature-and-restarted-its-rollout-192505246.html?src=rss
