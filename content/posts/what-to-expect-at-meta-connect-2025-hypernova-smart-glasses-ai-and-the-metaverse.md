<p>Meta Connect, the company&#39;s annual event dedicated to all things AR, VR, AI and the metaverse is just days away. And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.</p>
<p>This year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/connect/agenda/"><ins>scheduled</ins></a> to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17. A developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on September 18, beginning at 10AM, with more talks and developer sessions to follow.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear why Meta changed things up this year, but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for Connect. We&#39;re expecting two new models of smart glasses, including Meta&#39;s first to have a display, as well as new Meta AI and metaverse updates. As usual, Engadget will be reporting live from Zuckerberg&#39;s keynote at Meta HQ, but until then, here&#39;s a closer look at what&#39;s coming and what to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-and-updated-smart-glasses">New and updated smart glasses</h2>
<p>The biggest news of the day will be Meta&#39;s next-generation of smart glasses. The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/report-meta-could-release-its-first-true-ar-headset-as-soon-as-2027-222502610.html"><ins>Hypernova</ins></a>,&quot; will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.</p>
<p>While the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won&#39;t offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we&#39;ve seen on Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html"><ins>Orion prototype</ins></a>. Instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews. The glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband, similar to what the company showed off with Orion, that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures.</p>

<p>The glasses, which may officially be called &quot;Celeste,&quot; are expected to go on sale later this year, will likely cost around $800. They could be sold with Prada branding, which would be in line with Meta&#39;s longtime EssilorLuxottica partnership, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html"><ins>according to</ins></a> <em>CNBC.</em> Given the much higher price tag — most of Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban-branded glasses cost around $300 — it seems Meta is positioning this as a higher-end product that will have a more limited appeal. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658"><ins>suggested</ins></a> Hypernova will have a &quot;negligible&quot; share of the overall smart glasses market.</p>
<p>It also sounds like we could see a new version of Meta&#39;s smart glasses without a display with an updated version of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. There could be two versions for sunglasses and clear frames, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/renders-of-next-gen-ray-ban-meta-glasses-leak/"><ins>leaked renders</ins></a>. The new glasses are reported to have improved cameras and battery life, and support new AI capabilities.</p>
<p>We could also see new third-party glasses integrations. As <em>UploadVR </em>recently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-agenda-reveals-smart-glasses-sdk/"><ins>pointed out,</ins></a> early versions of the Connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that Meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses. Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta&#39;s ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-meta-ai">Meta AI</h2>
<p>As with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-already-has-1-billion-active-users-120023875.html"><ins>a billion</ins></a> monthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I&#39;m expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company&#39;s glasses and within its apps. <em>Business Insider</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hires-contractors-build-ai-chatbot-characters-key-markets-2025-9"><ins>reports</ins></a> the company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking &quot;character-driven&quot; bots for its apps. (Meta&#39;s character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html">recently blocking</a> teens&#39; access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)</p>
<p>Outside of Meta&#39;s chatbots, I&#39;m hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create &quot;superintelligence.&quot; As I wrote in July, his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html"><ins>initial manifesto</ins></a> that outlined his vision was confusing at best. The CEO has recently reorganized Meta&#39;s AI teams around the idea, and has been on a very expensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html"><ins>hiring spree</ins></a> to recruit executives and researchers for the effort.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zuckerberg could use Connect to shore up expectations around its Llama models. The company&#39;s larger Llama 4 model has <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc"><ins>been delayed</ins></a> and reports suggest Meta&#39;s engineers have been struggling to improve it. There are other signs that Zuckerberg may be <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html"><ins>backing away</ins></a> from open-source AI.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-the-metaverse">What about the metaverse?</h2>
<p>While the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to AI in recent years, it wouldn&#39;t be Connect without some VR-related news. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased &quot;metaverse software&quot; updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect. The company recently offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-ai-powered-npcs-to-the-metaverse-231605236.html"><ins>a preview</ins></a> to developers of its plan to bring AI-powered NPCs to the metaverse, and I expect we&#39;ll hear more about how generative AI could help shape the metaverse.</p>
<p>And while there are no new Quest headsets expected, we could hear more about those third-party VR headsets that will run Meta&#39;s VR software. Last year, the company announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html"><ins>ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox</ins></a> were working on Meta Horizon OS headsets. We haven&#39;t heard too much about these devices since, but there was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1878470166360580199"><ins>a leak earlier</ins></a> this year that suggested ASUS would be the first to launch, and that it would include face and eye tracking features.</p>

<p>Another intriguing possibility is an update on Meta&#39;s holographic Codec avatars we got <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-holographic-avatars-will-eventually-be-in-vr-too-235206805.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc"><ins>a glimpse</ins></a> of last year.
