<p>For Cyber Monday, Disney is offering the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=216504c2-a52a-45b8-8e9f-80e8c250cd97&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+and+Hulu+%28with+ads%29+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIxNjUwNGMyLWE1MmEtNDViOC04ZTlmLTgwZThjMjUwY2Q5NyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAafK9wZp4ZlPsBP9EzbQKmtBjOtFX6AcHVpDaZ8M5p1_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle</a> for just $5 a month for one year. That means you can pay $60, less than the price of taking your family to the movies, and get a year&#39;s worth of entertainment. The deal is available to both new and returning subscribers, and include access to all of the biggest hits in Disney&#39;s catalog, whether its Star Wars or <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>. But you only have a bit more time to take advantage of this offer — it runs through the end of the day December 1.</p> 
<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="1cce946041fa40eaa7e401a0fe5dc589" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.disneyplus.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from <em>Encanto </em>to <em>Inside Out 2</em>, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> 
<p>Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of <em>The Great</em> or <em>Abbott Elementary</em> without leaving the ecosystem.</p> 
<p>If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series.</p> 
<p>If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">best streaming services</a> outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones:</p>
