<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Representative Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are leading a group of congressional Democrats <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-stansbury-members-of-congress-launch-investigation-into-trump-crypto-and-ai-czars-ethics-conflicts">in investigating</a> White House Special Advisor David Sacks for possibly serving in his position for longer than he&#39;s allowed. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and venture capitalist at Craft Ventures, was originally picked by President Donald Trump to be the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/crypto-evangelist-david-sacks-will-serve-as-trumps-ai-and-cryptocurrency-advisor-170522273.html">&quot;White House A.I. &amp; Crypto Czar&quot;</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>&quot;Any effort to stay beyond the time limits imposed on you as a Special Government Employee (SGE) would raise additional ethics concerns for you and the Trump Administration,&quot; the group writes in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/david_sacks_sge_letter_91625.pdf">a letter to Sacks</a>,&quot;particularly as it moves to implement recently enacted cryptocurrency legislation and put in place new rules for the crypto industry.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides being friendly with the Trump campaign and allies like Elon Musk, Sacks was given his position because of his knowledge of the crypto and AI industries as an investor. That poses an obvious conflict of interest, something that&#39;s only waived during the 130-day limit that SGEs are supposed to serve. As Warren and the other Democrats backing the investigation note, though, it&#39;s possible Sacks has been working in his role for longer than that.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have worked every calendar day since the presidential inauguration, your 130th day of work in this role was May 29, 2025,&quot; the group writes. &quot;If you have worked every business day, your 130th day was July 25, 2025. As of the date of this letter, it is the 167th business day of this Administration.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of the investigation, Sacks is expected to offer a more detailed account of when and how he works in his advisory role, including if he answers government emails while working in Silicon Valley. Congressional Democrats are trying to verify if norms have been violated to make sure that they won&#39;t be violated in the future, but there are larger ethical concerns to contend with, too.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration has been friendly to the crypto industry, likely thanks in part to the influence of Sacks. Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-federal-bitcoin-reserve-order-leaves-the-crypto-market-unenthused-184135436.html">federal Bitcoin stockpile</a> and signed the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22genius+act%22%7D">GENIUS Act</a> into law in July, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically tied to the value of the US dollar. Continuing to serve in his role without leaving his position at Craft Ventures or disclosing his investments would only raise more questions about how Sacks stands to benefit from advising on regulation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/democrats-are-investigating-trump-crypto-advisor-david-sacks-over-a-possible-sge-violation-215758087.html?src=rss
