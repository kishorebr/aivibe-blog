<p>The US and Saudi Arabia have managed to derail negotiations regarding a landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vnl0yxg53o">according to a report by the <em>BBC</em></a>. The deal had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/pressbriefings/pages/imo-approves-netzero-regulations.aspx">already been approved</a> and would have made shipping the world&#39;s first industry to adopt internationally mandated emissions guidelines.</p>
<p>Representatives from more than 100 countries had gathered in London to formally approve the so-called global carbon tax, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://earthgovernance.org/blog/countries-reach-historic-deal-to-cut-shipping-emissions/">after nearly ten years of negotiations</a>. However, the US government had been pressuring countries to vote &quot;no&quot; on the measure, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/climate/imo-shipping-carbon-tax-trump">threatening tariffs</a> if met with noncompliance.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The US also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/taking-action-to-defend-america-from-the-uns-first-global-carbon-tax-the-international-maritime-organizations-imo-net-zero-framework-nzf">threatened other sanctions</a>, including blocking vessels from ports and visa restrictions. President Trump <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115385308751129485">has called it</a> a &quot;global green new scam.&quot; The country <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-exits-carbon-talks-shipping-urges-others-follow-document-2025-04-09/">withdrew from talks back in April</a>, just before the plan was approved.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia instituted a plan to derail negotiations. The country tabled a motion to adjourn talks for a year, at a time when most countries were set to vote on it. That passed by just a handful of votes, with approving votes coming from both the US and Russia.</p>
<p>This essentially destroys the plan, despite technically being just a delay, as timelines will have to be renegotiated. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1979209616425644482">&quot;huge win&quot;</a> for Trump.</p>

<p>Even the shipping industry was on-board with the plan, as it offered consistent global standards that don&#39;t currently exist. Industries like certainty. Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said that the organization is &quot;disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.&quot; He also said that the &quot;industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, carbon dioxide levels <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/carbon-dioxide-levels-increase-record-amount-new-highs-2024">reached record highs in 2024</a> and we aren&#39;t doing too much about it. This agreement would&#39;ve forced ship owners to use cleaner fuels beginning in 2028, or face fines. Shipping currently makes up around three percent of global carbon emissions, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/2023-imo-strategy-on-reduction-of-ghg-emissions-from-ships.aspx">but that&#39;s expected to rise</a> by anywhere from ten percent to 150 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Countries are expected to reconvene in April to discuss the plan, but this will likely not feature a vote. It&#39;ll likely be a renegotiation from the ground up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-and-saudi-arabia-just-derailed-a-global-plan-to-cut-shipping-emissions-184204170.html?src=rss
