<p>Kobo is making a remote control for its line of ereaders. The appropriately-named Kobo Remote costs $30 and will be <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Kobo;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=406e2ba9-8b67-4678-98f3-d7adbc26fcdf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;linkText=available+to+purchase+on+November+4&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LmtvYm8uY29tL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MDZlMmJhOS04YjY3LTQ2NzgtOThmMy1kN2FkYmMyNmZjZGYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbggVNeJu1xcypDiKIMca-r7sswpstpDHpiJfrDJBfGM&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Faccessories" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="http://www.kobo.com/accessories">available to purchase on November 4</a>.</p>
<p>A remote control for an ereader may seem silly to some, but avid readers will likely appreciate this accessory. It&#39;s basically a wireless page turner, so users can lay in bed and read all day without having to physically hold the device or prop a hand up to push a button every 30 seconds. Kobo is calling it &quot;the ideal reading companion.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has been custom-built for Kobo products and will be available in both black and white, which matches the company&#39;s other products. It can integrate with any Kobo ereader with Bluetooth functionality, which includes the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-libra-2-irl-153009550.html">Libra 2</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-clara-colour-review-judging-books-by-their-covers-is-now-more-fun-130013382.html">well-reviewed Clara Colour</a>.</p>
<p>“In a Canadian winter, we know that sometimes maximum reading comfort means burrowing down in the blankets, tucking yourself in and not emerging until spring,” said Rakuten Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn. “The Kobo Remote is the perfect accessory for peak immersive reading; it’s an invitation to lounge deeper, multitask smarter and simply enjoy reading without limits, no matter whether your environment is beach or blankets.&quot;</p>
<p>The remote will be available in multiple regions, including the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Japan and many others. The company says it&#39;ll be sharing more details about the remote soon, but we aren&#39;t sure what details could be left to share. It&#39;s a remote control for an ereader. Maybe it can do one or two unexpected things.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kobo-made-a-remote-control-for-its-ereaders-185010955.html?src=rss
