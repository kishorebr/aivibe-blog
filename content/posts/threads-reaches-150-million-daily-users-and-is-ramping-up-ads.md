<p>Threads has grown to 150 million daily active users. Mark Zuckerberg shared the latest milestone for the company&#39;s text-based app during Meta&#39;s third-quarter earnings call. The company previously  reported in August that Threads had reached more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-up-to-400-million-monthly-active-users-190203754.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">400 million</a> monthly users.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who has mused that Threads could become Meta&#39;s next billion-person app, said that it was &quot;on track to become the leader in its category.&quot; He also said that time spent in the app had increased by 10 percent, which he credited to improvements to the company&#39;s AI recommendation systems.&nbsp;</p><p>On Wednesday, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that Meta was also &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DQZYz4sEX72" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">exploring</a>&quot; algorithm personalization controls for Threads.
