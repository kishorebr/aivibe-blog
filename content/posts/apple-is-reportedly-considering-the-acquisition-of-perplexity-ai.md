<p>Apple&#39;s executives are thinking of acquiring Perplexity AI both to get more talent and to be able to offer an AI-based search engine in the future, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/apple-executives-have-held-internal-talks-about-buying-ai-startup-perplexity?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Adrian Perica, Apple&#39;s head of mergers and acquisitions, has reportedly already talked about the idea with services SVP Eddy Cue and the company&#39;s top decision-makers with it comes to its AI efforts. It&#39;s early stages, however: Apple has yet to talk to Perplexity about a bid, and the internal talks may not even lead to a formal offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The executives also reportedly discussed an alternative, wherein instead of buying Perplexity outright, it&#39;ll team up with the AI company instead. Either way, the idea is to develop an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and to integrate Perplexity&#39;s technology into Siri. While Apple has yet to make a formal offer, <em>Bloomberg</em> says it met several times with Perplexity over the past few months.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In May, Cue <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-considering-adding-ai-search-engines-to-safari-180502229.html">revealed</a> that Apple discussed a possible Safari-integration with Perplexity while on the stand for Google&#39;s ongoing Search antitrust case. Cue took the stand due to Apple&#39;s long-standing deal with Google to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. (In turn, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html">gets billions of dollars a year</a> — $18 billion in 2021 — from the arrangement.) Cue didn&#39;t share any definitive plans, however, including the possibility of an acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If regulators order Apple to end its partnership with Google, purchasing Perplexity would make it easier for the company to develop an AI-based search engine. In addition, it would allow the company to acquire talent needed to be able to catch up with other companies when it comes to artificial intelligence. Apple, like Meta, has been scouting for new AI talent. <em>Bloomberg</em> says it&#39;s even competing against the Facebook owner to hire Daniel Gross, the founder of AI company Safe Superintelligence Inc. The company does seem to need help to be able to release the AI features it wants to provide its users. A few months ago, for instance, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">delayed the rollout</a> of a more powerful Siri that was a key component of its original pitch for Apple Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-considering-the-acquisition-of-perplexity-ai-150012746.html?src=rss
