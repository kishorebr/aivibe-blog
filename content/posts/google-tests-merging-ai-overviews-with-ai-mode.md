As OpenAI goes into “Code Red” over competitive pressures, Google announced it has begun testing a new feature that merges its AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface.

Google calls this conversational feature AI Mode. It launched to U.S. users this May, and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT.


	
	




	
	



However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual.

But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead.

Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.

With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being.
