<p><em>Killing Satoshi</em>, an upcoming biopic about the elusive creator of Bitcoin, will reportedly rely heavily on artificial intelligence to generate locations and adjust actors&#39; performances, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://variety.com/2026/film/news/pete-davidson-killing-satoshi-ai-doug-liman-ryan-kavanaugh-1236661170/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Variety</em> reports</a>. The film was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/doug-liman-casey-affleck-pete-davidson-bitcoin-killing-satoshi-1236501408/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced in 2025</a> as being directed by Doug Liman (<em>The Bourne Identity</em>, <em>The Edge of Tomorrow</em>) and starring Casey Affleck and Pete Davidson in undisclosed roles, but its connection to overhyped technology was previously understood to begin and end with cryptocurrency.</p><p>According to a UK casting notice viewed by <em>Variety</em>, the producers of <em>Killing Satoshi</em> reserve the right to &quot;change, add to, take from, translate, reformat or reprocess” actors&#39; performances, using &quot;generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and/or machine learning technologies.&quot; No digital replicas will be created of performers, but it sounds like plenty of other AI-driven tweaks are on the table. The production&#39;s use of AI will also extend to the setting of its shoots, per Variety&#39;s source. <em>Killing Satoshi</em> will be shot on a &quot;markerless performative capture stage&quot; and things like backgrounds and locations will be entirely generated by AI.</p><p>You guess is as good as mine as to why a film about blockchain technology needs to be filmed this way, but Doug Liman has been connected with plenty of unusual projects in the past, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/doug-liman-direct-tom-cruise-space-set-movie-1296052/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a rumored Tom Cruise film</a> that was supposed to film on the International Space Station. <em>Killing Satoshi</em> will be far less practical in comparison, and walking a much finer line of what&#39;s acceptable in the entertainment industry. </p><p>A major sticking point in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sag-aftra-deal-includes-a-40-million-streaming-bonus-and-ai-protections-204526458.html?src=rss++++++++++++++++++++++++" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">SAG-AFTRA&#39;s 2023 contract negotiations</a> was guaranteeing protections for actors who could be replaced by AI.
