A DOGE <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/857b6c65-0690-4b3c-b438-e3dc1dc87340.pdf">PowerPoint presentation</a> obtained by the publication notes that its "AI Solution" — reportedly called the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool — found that 100,000 out of over 200,000 regulations "can be deleted." The document sets a September 1 goal deadline for agencies to complete their own deregulation lists using the tool, which it says can be done in under four weeks, and then "DOGE will roll-up a delete list of 50% of all Federal Regulations (100k Regulatory Rules)."</p>
<p>The tool is targeting regulations that are no longer required by law, <em>The Washington Post reports</em>. After it makes its suggestions, staffers would review the proposed deletions before finalizing a plan. According to the PowerPoint, the tool has already been tried out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), where it's been used to write "100% of deregulations," and by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for decisions on 1,083 regulatory sections. <em>The Washington Post</em> spoke to three HUD employees who confirmed it was recently used. One also said that the tool got things wrong on several occasions, misreading the language of the law at times.</p>
