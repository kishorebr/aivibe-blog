Most of the time, I'll fall asleep during a "Real Housewives" scene and wake up two episodes later.Also: Your Sony headphones just got a useful Bluetooth upgrade with the latest software patch There's a feature in your iPhone's settings that can enable some AirPods to pause your audio content when they detect that you've fallen asleep. Here's how to turn it on, and how it worked when I tried it.What is AirPods sleep detection?With one of the recent iOS 26 software updates, Apple implemented a new sleep detection feature for AirPods. This feature is disabled by default, so you'll need to access your iPhone settings to enable it. If you do, put your AirPods Pro 2, Pro 3, or AirPods 4 in your ear and play media. Your AirPods can then detect when you fall asleep and respond by pausing the media. When your AirPods are connected to your iPhone, open your phone's settings, tap on your AirPods' settings, and scroll down to "Pause Media When Falling Asleep."How does it work?I've only tried the sleep detection feature with the AirPods Pro 3. Each time I wore my AirPods while flying, I connected them to my MacBook and played my TV show.
