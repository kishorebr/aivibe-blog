    AI's not 'reasoning' at all - how this team debunked the industry hype
     
    Researchers just got very specific about what a language model's 'chain of thought' is actually doing.

They achieve a lot that is impressive, but for the most part, we cannot observe all that they are doing when they take an input, such as a prompt you type, and they produce an output, such as the college term paper you requested or the suggestion for your new novel.In the breach, scientists have applied colloquial terms such as "reasoning" to describe the way the programs perform. In the process, they have either implied or outright asserted that the programs can "think," "reason," and "know" in the way that humans do. In the past two years, the rhetoric has overtaken the science as AI executives have used hyperbole to twist what were simple engineering achievements. Also: What is OpenAI'
