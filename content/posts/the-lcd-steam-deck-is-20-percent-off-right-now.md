<p>Steam's seasonal sales are usually the peak moments to add new software to your library, but right now, Valve is offering a notable hardware discount. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a> starter model is currently on sale for 20 percent off its usual $399 price tag. That means you can snag yourself the gaming handheld with an LCD screen and 256GB of storage for $319. Steam hasn't set an end date for this offer, so it might be worth acting quickly if you want to get in on this particular sale.</p>

But keep in mind before you add this to your cart that this iteration does have a few limitations compared to the higher end Steam Decks. The LCD screen doesn't have the true blacks of the OLED option, and serious players may run up against the storage limits of this model pretty quickly. But if you've been curious about a Steam Deck and aren't looking to have a full library of big AAA downloads available all at once, this is a good time to pick up one of your own. Besides, with the $80 you'll save, you can also grab a copy of current indie darlings <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-costs-5-more-than-the-original-120005386.html"><em><ins>Hollow Knight: Silksong</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html"><em><ins>Hades II</ins></em></a> and still have money leftover.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
