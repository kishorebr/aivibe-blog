<p>Panic is not messing around with Playdate&#39;s second season. After <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-fulcrum-defender-dig-dig-dino-and-blippo-140036697.html"><ins>starting off Season Two</ins></a> on the right foot with <em>Dig! Dig! Dino!</em>, <em>Fulcrum Defender</em> and the surprise rollout of<em> Blippo+</em>, the team has followed through with another strong pair of games for week two. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://play.date/games/the-whiteout/"><em><ins>The Whiteout</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://play.date/games/wheelsprung/"><em><ins>Wheelsprung</ins></em></a> are, like the week one games, polar opposites of each other: a somber, narrative-heavy post-apocalyptic adventure and a nutty dirtbike game with realistic(ish) physics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking for <em>any</em> throughline between them, I&#39;ve got you. It&#39;s squirrels. You&#39;ll see. (Alright I may be reaching, but as both a journalist and a wildlife rehabilitator who is currently raising orphaned squirrels, just let me have this one).</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This week also brought an update for the &quot;intergalactic TV service,&quot;<em> Blippo+</em>, and it looks like we&#39;ll be getting new content for some time to come. The Season Two team wrote in an email accompanying the latest drop that &quot;<em>Blippo+</em> itself is going to update every week for eleven (!) weeks, every Thursday at 10AM PT [1PM ET].&quot; Once it&#39;s all over, there will be reruns. We&#39;ll get a countdown for that on week 12, the team says. Now, let&#39;s get into the new games.</p>

<p>Minutes into playing Scenic Route Software&#39;s <em>The Whiteout, </em>I became certain that this was going to be another game that would make me cry. The narrative tone is heavy, the atmosphere is bleak and absolutely nothing about it suggests that anything is going to get better… ever. It feels hopeless from the start, but you have to keep trudging along anyway. (If you&#39;ve ever read <em>The Road</em>, the feeling should be familiar). When I finally reached the end, though, I wasn&#39;t in tears — I was totally speechless, in a &quot;mouth hanging open, empty inside&quot; kind of way. It&#39;s stunning.</p>
<p><em>The Whiteout </em>is narrative driven, picking up in a barren post-apocalyptic version of the US in which a snowstorm began one spring and never stopped. The events are set in current times — the onset of the snow occurred in spring 2025 — giving it an eerie, close to home kind of quality. Everything about it feels like something that <em>could</em> happen. As you play through its five chapters, the story is told through the playable character&#39;s musings about the past and present. It&#39;s all beautifully written, with numerous sentimental moments that felt genuinely heartbreaking.</p>
<p>It did manage to get a few smiles out of me though; the character makes cynical quips here and there, and a nefarious bunch called The Woodpeckers comes to be known simply as &quot;the &#39;peckers,&quot; which got me every time. And the appearance of a squirrel just kind of hanging out in the background served as a refreshing sign of life amid the desolation. (I wondered while playing if the squirrel was a checkpoint, but I&#39;d have to go through it all again to figure that out for sure.)</p>
<p>The gameplay entails mostly linear exploration, searching for resources, solving puzzles and making choices about your next moves. There&#39;s not much in the way of action, and you spend most of the game just walking with a slowness that is at times maddening. But, while I definitely would have appreciated the option to speed up even a little (a gentle jog, maybe?), the lethargy helps to illustrate how hard it would be to carry on in such conditions. Backtracking several times to get all the resources you need to progress in some areas is painfully tedious, so the relief when you do complete the action is real. Patience is key in this game.</p>
<p>I fear some people will give up on this title early because of the pace, and I implore you <em>not</em> to do that. It&#39;s worth every minute. It&#39;s also worth it to play with headphones, as recommended, to really let yourself be immersed in the setting. I stayed up half the night playing and got up early the next morning to finish it, and I&#39;m still thinking about the ending I came to. There are multiple endings according to the creators, so I&#39;ll likely dive back in for another go once I&#39;ve had more time to digest. <em>The Whiteout </em>is without a doubt the most memorable game of both Playdate seasons to date.</p>

<p>So, you played<em> The Whiteout</em> and now you&#39;re depressed. The Playdate team seems to have prepared for this, because the other game that dropped this week with the second release of Season Two may as well be the antidote. <em>Wheelsprung</em> is cute, charming and silly as hell. It&#39;s also a pretty challenging (and frustrating) physics game, but I do love a game that pisses me off a little.</p>
<p>The art of <em>Wheelsprung</em> is instantly recognizable as that of Julie Bjørnskov, one of the creators of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/if-you-like-puzzles-check-out-this-trippy-comic-style-escape-room-game-for-playdate-200003217.html"><em><ins>Escape the Boardgame</ins></em></a> and <em>Escape the Arcade</em>, which is to say it&#39;s oozing whimsy. Bjørnskov made this one with programmer Nino van Hooff. The story is pretty simple: a family with a child who <em>loves </em>nuts — like, enough to scatter them all over the place in joy — has briefly left their home unattended, and you&#39;re a squirrel equipped with an absurdly flexible dirtbike who is on a mission to collect as many nuts as possible in their absence. There are nearly three dozen levels to complete, each of them an obstacle course you must figure out how to navigate on the two-wheeler. There&#39;s also a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://github.com/ninovanhooff/wheelsprung/wiki/Level-Editor"><ins>level editor</ins></a> to create your own tracks.</p>
<p>The squirrel&#39;s dirtbike is basically a Dr. Seuss contraption, and it&#39;s capable of some pretty impressive maneuvers. Lean in either direction using the D-pad and it can do a wheelie. Hit the down arrow and it&#39;ll instantly turn you to face the other way. But you must always be conscious of your balance. Allowing the squirrel&#39;s helmet to so much as <em>tap</em> an obstacle will result in a run-ending wipeout, as of course will all-out crashing. This game forces you to get extremely creative to traverse complicated tracks. There&#39;s a leaderboard and ideally you want to finish with the fastest time possible, but for a handful of levels my main goal at first was just figuring out how to make it to the end at all.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to give away too many hints about how to excel in this game, but I sure have spent a surprising amount of time driving my bike upside down dangling from one wheel, or rocking the bike back and forth to creep forward like an inchworm. It is absolutely ridiculous, and lots of (somewhat rage-inducing) fun.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-the-whiteout-and-wheelsprung-130014285.html?src=rss
