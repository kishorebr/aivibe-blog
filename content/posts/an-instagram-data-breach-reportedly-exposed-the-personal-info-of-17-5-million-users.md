<p>If you received a bunch of password reset requests from Instagram recently, you&#39;re not alone. As reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malwarebytes.com/post/3mbywfybiil26">Malwarebytes</a>, an antivirus software company, there was a data breach revealing the &quot;sensitive information&quot; of 17.5 million Instagram users. Malwarebytes added that the leak included Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and more.</p>
<p>The company added that the &quot;data is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals.&quot; Malwarebytes noted in an email to its customers that it discovered the breach during its routine dark web scan and that it&#39;s tied to a potential incident related to an Instagram API exposure from 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reported breach has resulted in users receiving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q93j15/instagram_data_leak_exposes_sensitive_info_of/">several</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q8pcq1/is_someone_trying_to_hack_me/">emails</a> from Instagram about password reset requests. According to Malwarebytes, the leaked information could lead to more serious attacks, like phishing attempts or account takeovers. Meta hasn&#39;t released an official statement about the latest incident, but it&#39;s not the first time Instagram&#39;s parent company has been in hot water for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-gdpr-data-breach-eu-fine-173528015.html">data breaches</a>. If you haven&#39;t already, it&#39;s always a good idea to turn on two-factor authentication and change your password. Even better, you can review what devices are logged into your Instagram account in Meta&#39;s Accounts Center.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/an-instagram-data-breach-reportedly-exposed-the-personal-info-of-175-million-users-192105616.html?src=rss
