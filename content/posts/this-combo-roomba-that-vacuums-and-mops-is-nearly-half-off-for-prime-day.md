<p>It's that time of year again when Amazon is hosting deals on everything from wireless earbuds to air fryers. Starting July 8, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-2025-the-best-early-deals-you-can-shop-now-dates-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-120028413.html">Prime Day</a> will run for four days with deep price cuts on smart home gadgets, including the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVJ3K8FF?th=1">Roomba Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo</a> from iRobot that drops down to an all-time low of $140 from its original $275 price tag. While this Roomba was marked down to $149 earlier this year, the Prime Day deal is the first time we're seeing a 49 percent discount. Just note that this deal is only for Prime members at the moment.</p> 
<p>We ranked iRobot's Roomba Robot Vacuum as our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">overall favorite budget option</a>, but this Prime Day deal features a version that can both vacuum and mop. With the Prime Day price drop, the vacuum and mop combo is cheaper than the vacuum-only model, but it does double the work. The combo Roomba can even be set to only vacuum if you prefer to mop yourself, but you'd be missing out on the four-stage cleaning system that vacuums and mops in the same pass.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Since it's a Roomba, it's a straightforward setup process that takes a few minutes before you can set it and forget it. The robot vacuum can navigate through your house or apartment, avoiding furniture and stairs, thanks to onboard sensors. Once it drains through its battery, which can last up to 120 hours, the Roomba knows to return to its charging dock to recharge itself. You can even customize this combo Roomba with three levels of both suction power for vacuuming and water levels for mopping. For more control, you can program it to spot clean a single spot in your home or schedule cleaning times through the companion iRobot Home app.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-combo-roomba-that-vacuums-and-mops-is-nearly-half-off-for-prime-day-141013857.html?src=rss
