<p>You can add Perplexity to the growing list of AI companies offering $200+ per month subscription plans to users who want unlimited access to their most advanced products and tools. As of today, Perplexity Max is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-max">available on iOS and the web</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscription comes with unlimited monthly usage of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-labs">Labs</a>, the agentic creation tool Perplexity released this past May. People can use Labs to generate spreadsheets, presentations, web applications and more. Perplexity is also promising early access to new features, including Comet, a new web browser the company claims will be a &quot;powerful thought partner for everything you do on the web.&quot; The company adds Max subscribers will receive priority customer support, as well as access to top frontier models from partners like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-claude-opus-4-model-can-work-autonomously-for-nearly-a-full-workday-164526696.html">Anthropic</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-o3-and-o4-mini-models-are-all-about-thinking-with-images-170043465.html">OpenAI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Perplexity will continue to offer its existing Pro plan, which remains $20 per month. Admittedly, the  company is courting a small demographic with the new subscription, noting it&#39;s primarily designed for content designers, business strategists and academic research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI was the first to open the floodgates of very expensive AI subscriptions when it began offering its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-wants-200-a-month-for-its-most-advanced-features-191054506.html">ChatGPT Pro plan</a> at the end of last year. Since then, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html">Anthropic</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html">Google</a> have followed suit.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-joins-anthropic-and-openai-in-offering-a-200-per-month-subscription-191715149.html?src=rss
