<p>If you&#39;re an iPhone user who likes to keep tabs on where your stuff is, you <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">can&#39;t go far wrong with an AirTag</a>. The second-gen model that Apple just released <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html">outpaces the original</a> in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it&#39;s easy enough to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device&#39;s battery life for a very long time. Enter Elevation Lab&#39;s extended battery case for the AirTag, which is currently <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D1LHBZGL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=61f14f8b-e71c-4724-a1bf-0d7992632921&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=on+sale+at+Amazon+for+%2416&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0w_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjFmMTRmOGItZTcxYy00NzI0LWExYmYtMGQ3OTkyNjMyOTIxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0wiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5tp9jRsXPC9KB06SrtQgpAFy3tN1LYQFPUDmeGSjg2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1LHBZGL" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1LHBZGL?th=1">on sale at Amazon for $16</a>.</p> 
<p>The case usually sells for $23, so that&#39;s a 30 percent discount. It&#39;s not the first time <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html">we&#39;ve seen this deal</a>, but it&#39;s a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="efc544def3c14a1fad815709bd51e238" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1LHBZGL?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won&#39;t exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it&#39;s too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn&#39;t have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you&#39;re looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> 
<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker&#39;s battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It&#39;s sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What&#39;s more, it doesn&#39;t ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> 
<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device&#39;s volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p>
