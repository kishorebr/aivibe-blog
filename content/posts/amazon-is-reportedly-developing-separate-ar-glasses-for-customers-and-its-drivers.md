<p>Amazon may be muscling into the field of augmented reality glasses. According to a report by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-ar-glasses-challenge-meta"><em>The Information</em></a>, sources claimed that the company is working on AR glasses for consumers, allegedly with plans to release the product in late 2026 or early 2027.</p>

This productivity-focused option, which would reportedly shave seconds off drivers&#39; times, could be ready by the second quarter of 2026, according to <em>The Information</em>&#39;s sources.</p>
<p>If Amazon does release these AR sets, it will primarily be in competition with Meta, which already sells simpler smart glasses with Ray-Ban.
