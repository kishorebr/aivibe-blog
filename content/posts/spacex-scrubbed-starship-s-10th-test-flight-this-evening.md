<p>SpaceX&#39;s massive Starship rocket was scheduled to lift off from the company&#39;s Texas launch site this evening for its 10th flight. After scrubbing the launch initially planned for Sunday, August 24, things were apparently back on track for Monday, August 25. The launch window opened at 7:30PM ET (6:30PM CT) and was even livestreamed on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10">SpaceX</a> website and on X, with a webcast starting 30 minutes before the supposed launch. However, SpaceX ultimately <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1960130754714935426">stood down</a> from the test flight due to weather conditions at 8:02PM. The company is still determining the next launch opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather looked iffy for launch, as well; SpaceX said on Saturday that conditions were looking only 45 percent favorable. Ultimately the Sunday (and then the Monday) launch was cancelled &quot;to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,&quot; according to a SpaceX post on X.</p>

If all goes according to plan for Flight 10, Starship will deploy eight dummy Starlink satellites and perform &quot;several experiments focused on enabling Starship’s upper stage to return to the launch site.&quot; It won&#39;t actually be returning to the launch site this time, though. The test is expected to last a little over an hour, and end with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</p>
