<p>A recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that lasted 13 hours was reportedly caused by one of its own AI tools, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/00c282de-ed14-4acd-a948-bc8d6bdb339d"><ins>according to reporting by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. This happened in December after engineers deployed the Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, say four people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Kiro is an agentic tool, meaning it can take autonomous actions on behalf of users. In this case, the bot reportedly determined that it needed to &quot;delete and recreate the environment.&quot; This is what allegedly led to the lengthy outage that primarily impacted China.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon says it was merely a &quot;coincidence that AI tools were involved&quot; and that &quot;the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action.&quot; The company blamed the outage on &quot;user error, not AI error.&quot; It said that by default the Kiro tool “requests authorization before taking any action” but that the staffer involved in the December incident had &quot;broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Multiple Amazon employees spoke to <em>Financial Times</em> and noted that this was &quot;at least&quot; the second occasion in recent months in which the company&#39;s AI tools were at the center of a service disruption. &quot;The outages were small but entirely foreseeable,&quot; said one senior AWS employee.</p>
