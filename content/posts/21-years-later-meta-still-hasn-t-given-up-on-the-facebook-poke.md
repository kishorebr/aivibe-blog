<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Meta currently has lots of priorities Mark Zuckerberg likely never would have imagined back in the early days of Facebook. The company has pivoted from social networking to the metaverse and, most recently, to AI. But somehow, one of its earliest — and most useless — features has not only survived but is apparently getting a revamp. I&#39;m talking, of course, about </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features#Poke">the poke</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which Meta is once again trying to revive.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The company is making the storied feature easier to find by adding pokes back to user profiles in the Facebook app, according to </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL6-CBjKDk/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">a post</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> it shared on Instagram. And you can track all poking-related activity between you and your friends at </span><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=02f8f688-8fc3-4d6a-81d3-76326f4d9892&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;linkText=facebook.com%2Fpokes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL3Bva2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMmY4ZjY4OC04ZmMzLTRkNmEtODFkMy03NjMyNmY0ZDk4OTIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vcG9rZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAa8g4WrEssRifULU3tHt_bq3xfRz5KkJ9URLekQ1KgB4&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com%2Fpokes" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Portal from Facebook;elmt:" data-original-link="http://facebook.com/pokes"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">facebook.com/pokes</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. It even looks like there&#39;s a Snapchat-streak like aspect where different emojis appear based on how many pokes have been exchanged.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Just in case you weren&#39;t on Facebook two decades ago, &quot;poking&quot; was something of a novelty in the early days of the social network. At the time, there weren&#39;t that many features for interacting with your friends. You could leave comments on their profile and … you could &quot;poke.&quot; The feature never really did anything, but depending on who it came from it was considered something between creepy or flirty.&nbsp; As Meta notes in its Instagram post, poking never really went away, but it was de-emphasized over the years and has been largely forgotten by users.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But the company has for some reason been trying to get poking to make a comeback for a while now. Meta said last year the feature was &quot;having a moment&quot; and that there had been a 13x spike in pokes after the company began surfacing the feature in the Facebook search bar. Now, it seems Meta is trying to build even more momentum for it, presumably for the current generation of younger Facebook users.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year he wants to bring back more &quot;OG&quot; Facebook features like… being able to find content posted by your </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-decides-content-from-your-actual-friends-is-an-og-facebook-feature-180803853.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">actual friends</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. And it&#39;s hard to get more &quot;OG Facebook&quot; than poking. Meta has also been on a years-long mission </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-says-the-future-of-facebook-is-young-adults-again-203500866.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">to win over</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> &quot;young adults,&quot;&nbsp; so it might see the jokey feature as a way to appeal to a generation used to taking their Snap streak extremely seriously.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/21-years-later-meta-still-hasnt-given-up-on-the-facebook-poke-000446458.html?src=rss
