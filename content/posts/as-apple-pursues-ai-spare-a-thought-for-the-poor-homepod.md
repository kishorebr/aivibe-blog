<p>When the video kicking off Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-apple-revealed-at-the-iphone-17-launch-event-iphone-air-iphone-17-pro-airpods-pro-3-and-more-171028663.html"><ins>&quot;Awe dropping&quot; event</ins></a> began yesterday, I was pleased to see a HomePod in the opening shot. I hadn&#39;t given any thought to Apple&#39;s beleaguered smart home speaker in ages, so I was all set for Tim Cook and crew to deliver an actual surprise and reveal new stuff for HomePod. When the entire presentation then passed without another peep about the product, I was disappointed, but resigned.</p>
<p>HomePod has always been behind the curve. When smart speakers first came on the scene, the sector was quickly dominated by Amazon and Google, with Sonos as the boutique third-party option. Apple <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-05-apple-homepod-smart-speaker.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> the HomePod in June 2017, almost three years after Amazon <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-06-amazon-echo-speaker.html"><ins>unveiled</ins></a> its original Echo speaker.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The HomePod arrived too slow and cost too much, and (in an echo of the company&#39;s current woes) Siri was too unhelpful, for the smart speaker to really claw back much market share from its rivals. The Mini iteration came out in late 2020, and the second-generation HomePod in February 2023 added support for Thread smart home standard. Not exactly pushing the boundaries of smart speaker innovation.</p>
<p>And things got worse for the poor HomePod as voice-controlled AI assistants have transitioned away from being centered around dedicated speakers. AI is now being integrated ever-more tightly into our smartphones and computers, with less need for a separate intermediary device. Which brings us to the ongoing issue of Apple&#39;s shaky foothold in the AI race.</p>
<p>Apple has been promising a big overhaul to Siri for awhile, with the new and improved version currently not due until <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html"><ins>spring 2026</ins></a>. To show off that new AI assistant, Apple is reportedly working on an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-smart-home-hub-could-reportedly-make-its-debut-later-this-year-161702487.html"><ins>interactive smart home hub</ins></a> that is expected to have HomePod-like audio capabilities baked in, but won&#39;t be ready for launch until <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-tabletop-robot-companion-rumored-for-2027-launch-204904807.html"><ins>at least 2027</ins></a>. What&#39;s a company to do in the interim?</p>
<p>It makes sense for Apple to hold back on any big developments to its existing Siri-centric smart home speaker. I get it. But I could have been hyped to see a stripped down HomePod that focused more on being a speaker than on being smart. I have a Sonos that I love, and part of me assumed that I would eventually upgrade to an Apple offering. The AirPods are such a great element in the Apple ecosystem, and I use mine almost daily. Having a powerful, high-quality home speaker that delivers the easy interconnectivity that&#39;s such a big part of Apple&#39;s value proposition might have helped bridge the time gap, keeping Apple in people&#39;s minds as a player in home tech while the company works on its next, more innovative move. Take one step back to take three steps forward.</p>
<p>In practice, though, it feels like the window for the HomePod to become a star in Apple&#39;s lineup has shrunk to almost nothing. As I now look at the recent trends in AI and home tech, I don&#39;t see an obvious space for a smart speaker. That&#39;s not limited to Apple; it&#39;s also pretty telling that both Amazon and Google haven&#39;t been giving much love to their smart speakers either. In fact, a majority of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html"><ins>Engadget&#39;s favorite smart speakers</ins></a> this year are from specialist Sonos as the big tech names have put their focus on AI instead of audio. We&#39;ll still have smart speakers, but they&#39;ll be folded into multi-purpose gadgets and pitched as general smart-home aids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, there&#39;s been no indication that Apple will sunset the HomePod. But my personal prediction is that HomePod will stay on the sidelines for now and get pushed even farther away from the spotlight when the new smart home products are unveiled, receiving only occasional attention until Apple officially and quietly pulls the plug for good. And so will end the life of a star-crossed product that never got the chance to shine at its full potential. Here&#39;s hoping I&#39;m wrong.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/as-apple-pursues-ai-spare-a-thought-for-the-poor-homepod-223250670.html?src=rss
