<p>It’s been less than three months since we got our first look at <em>Control Resonant</em>, the sequel to Remedy’s mind-bending, third-person adventure that introduced us to Jesse Faden and the Federal Bureau of Control. At today’s State of Play event, we got to see the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/new-gameplay-details-on-control-resonants-supernatural-action/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">first extended bit of gameplay</a> from <em>Control Resonant</em> — and the combat looks as inspired as ever, though the setting is completely new.</p><p>As we learned in December, the next <em>Control</em> games doesn’t focus on Jesse Faden; instead, you’ll primarily play as her brother Dylan who Jesse was trying to find for much of the first game. Dylan’s out in a warped version of New York City trying to track the game’s Resonant creatures that are responsible for whatever calamity has taken place. We knew this already, but the change of setting from the Bureau of Control building into the more open city setting should go a long way towards making this game feel fresh. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA71hdzim0M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Dylan’s capabilities are also completely different than what we saw from Jesse in the original. There’s a much bigger emphasis on melee combat, as Dylan has a shapeshifting weapon called the Aberrant. You can switch from hammer to blades to other various forms, much in the way that Jesse’s firearm in the first game could morph between different types of guns. </p><p>But the thing that stood out the most to me in the brief preview was the way that NYC completely disobeyed the laws of physics. Buildings and streets would just head into the sky at 90-degree angles —&nbsp;and Dylan’s powers let him completely which surface is the “ground” for him. </p><p>There’s still no firm release date for <em>Control Resonant</em>, but that’s not unreasonable —&nbsp;the game was only announced a few months ago. Remedy says they’re still on target to launch in 2026. And, at the end of today’s PlayStation blog post, they promise that “things are going to get weirder.” Just what I was hoping for!</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html?src=rss
