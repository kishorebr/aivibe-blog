<p>Now that the winter holidays are well and truly past, now&#39;s the perfect time to take stock of your tech setup. If you were gifted (or gifted yourself) some new gear in December, make sure that you&#39;ve got the proper accessories to keep that gear performing at its best. If a new way to power all those batteries would be a benefit, Amazon&#39;s currently running a discount on an excellent wireless charging pad.

That&#39;s only a little bit above the lowest price we&#39;ve ever seen for the product (which was $90), and it&#39;s still a 32 percent discount off its usual cost.</p>

<p>This is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html"><ins>our top pick</ins></a> for a 3-in-1 charging pad thanks to its versatility. The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product. The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
