<p>“Yesterday, following Vimeo’s recent acquisition by a private equity firm, I learned that I, along with a large portion of the company, was impacted by layoffs,” wrote the company’s former vice president of Global Brand &amp; Creative, Dave Brown. He is referring to a firm called Bending Spoons that bought Vimeo for $1.38 billion <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/vimeo-to-be-acquired-by-bending-spoons-in-1-38b-all-cash-deal/"><ins>in the latter half of 2025</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We don&#39;t know why parent company Bending Spoons conducted such a massive round of layoffs, but the equity firm is known for purchasing tech companies and aggressively cutting costs via layoffs.

Engadget has reached out to Vimeo to inquire about the exact number of employees that were laid off and will update this post when we hear back.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm that a layoff was announced at Vimeo on January 20, 2026. To respect the privacy of those departing, we cannot provide additional details at this time,” a Bending Spoons spokesperson told <em>Gizmodo</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://gizmodo.com/vimeo-lays-off-most-of-its-staff-allegedly-includes-the-entire-video-team-2000713416"><ins>in an emailed statement</ins></a>. &quot;Going forward, Bending Spoons remains committed to growing Vimeo to meet the needs of its diverse user base.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to know the company &quot;remains committed to growing Vimeo&quot; after firing just about everyone that works there. One former employee said on X that it &quot;sucks to see something I built killed by private equity in a technology company skin suit.&quot;</p>
<p>Vimeo has been around a long time. The platform was founded a full year before YouTube and has positioned itself as being a premium alternative for hosting creative and business-adjacent videos. We have no idea what it&#39;ll look like with a minimal staff and no video team.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/vimeo-lays-off-most-of-its-staff-just-months-after-being-bought-by-private-equity-firm-184556023.html?src=rss
