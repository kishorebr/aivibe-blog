<p>The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.</p><p>More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.</p><h2 id="cbc11c13-20f0-4f78-bd1e-8f9d8de8b7b3">The CES 2026 schedule</h2><p>Press conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://exhibitors.ces.tech/8_0/#/" data-i13n="slk:a searchable directory;cpos:1;pos:1">a searchable directory</a> of who will have an official presence at the show, along with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/schedule/" data-i13n="slk:a schedule;cpos:2;pos:1">a schedule</a> of every official panel and presentation. However, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/media-guides/media-days/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">press conference schedule</a> gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. </p><p>On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look" data-i13n="slk:&quot;The First Look,&quot;;cpos:4;pos:1">"The First Look,"</a> a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's "vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences."&nbsp;Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details).  Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. </p><p>That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=%22Innovation+in+Tune+with+You%2C%22&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vc2cvYWJvdXQtbGcvcHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2xnLXRvLXNob3djYXNlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW4tdHVuZS13aXRoLXlvdS1hdC1jZXMtMjAyNi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2NDVhYjQwLTIwYjEtNGNmMC1iZGNmLTllOTY1NmM3OTA2MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3NnL2Fib3V0LWxnL3ByZXNzLWFuZC1tZWRpYS9sZy10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLXR1bmUtd2l0aC15b3UtYXQtY2VzLTIwMjYvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVdFbvagfuLjdXSTGikLKfxv5Lxz8K374JXMuW2mYP05&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fsg%2Fabout-lg%2Fpress-and-media%2Flg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;slk:&quot;Innovation in Tune with You&quot;;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/sg/about-lg/press-and-media/lg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026/">"Innovation in Tune with You,"</a> is ostensibly to share "its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence." But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. </p><p>Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Hisense</a>, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130005307.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Lego</a>. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-presentation-live-130028065.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang</a> takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. </p><p>Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Core Ultra Series 3 processors</a>, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html" data-i13n="slk:a keynote;cpos:10;pos:1">a keynote</a> address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Sony Honda Mobility</a>.

It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. </p><h2 id="3a5e935e-daac-4c69-bf38-d7463d8361d0">Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicity</h2><p>As noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">debut its first Micro RGB television at CES</a>. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. </p><p>Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">LG Gallery TV</a> will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">5K-capable gaming monitors</a> on deck with built-in AI upscaling.</p><p>But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">Dolby-powered modular home audio system</a>, a new line of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">xboom speakers</a> (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">home automation robot named CLOiD</a>. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">ultralight Aerominum laptops</a>.</p><p>Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES</a>, for starters. The company already introduced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025</a>, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. </p><p>Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">6K model</a> that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html" data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1">Freestyle projector</a> for 2026, too. </p><p>And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.</a></p><p>Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.</p><h2 id="fd99c033-cf1c-46a6-bc2e-3ba9ecd7cd60">New chips from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm</h2><p>CES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever" data-i13n="slk:Ryzen 7 9850X3D;cpos:26;pos:1">Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a>, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcguide.com/cpu/amd-ryzen-9000g-release-date-specs-price/" data-i13n="slk:Ryzen 9000G;cpos:27;pos:1">Ryzen 9000G</a> series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html" data-i13n="slk:FSR Redstone;cpos:28;pos:1">FSR Redstone</a> AI upscaling tech.</p><p>Intel has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html" data-i13n="slk:publicly announced;cpos:29;pos:1">publicly announced</a> that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall "AI PC" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops.

Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.</p><p>Sony announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sonys-2025-bravia-tv-lineup-includes-a-new-flagship-qd-oled-model-160019669.html" data-i13n="slk:a collection of new Bravia TVs;cpos:34;pos:1">a collection of new Bravia TVs</a> in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix.

In March 2025, Sony introduced a new <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=205f44ce-77be-4119-a5db-84e810a586b7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sony-UK&amp;linkText=RGB+LED+panel&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAQjl0CHSLu-e4f5LhX9rq454peFeTRK2L4mGcS8iLZ0l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.co.uk%2Fpresscentre%2Fsony-develops-next-generation-display-system-with-proprietary-signal-processing-technology-for-individual-rgb-control-of-high-density-led-backlights" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sony-UK;elmt:;slk:RGB LED panel;cpos:35;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.sony.co.uk/presscentre/sony-develops-next-generation-display-system-with-proprietary-signal-processing-technology-for-individual-rgb-control-of-high-density-led-backlights">RGB LED panel</a> that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's "General RGB LED Backlight Technology" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has already trademarked the name <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1764577431" data-i13n="slk:&quot;True RGB,&quot;;cpos:36;pos:1">"True RGB,"</a> which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1764577431" data-i13n="slk:a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor;cpos:37;pos:1">a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor</a> coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.</p><p>Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens.
