<p>Google&#39;s latest AI adventure is a new option for search. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/web-guide-labs/"><ins>Web Guide</ins></a> is a new way that Google will organize search results based on analysis by a dedicated version of its Gemini artificial intelligence tool. The claim in the announcement is that AI can help surface the most relevant content, but it could also be a new way for Google to control what websites get prime billing in results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the graphic shared alongside the blog post announcing this Search Labs experiment, the company showed clusters of results to the query &quot;how to solo travel in Japan.&quot; Web Guide displayed a few hits each under different headers, such as &quot;Comprehensive Guides for Solo Travel in Japan,&quot; &quot;Personal Experiences and Tips from Solo Travelers&quot; and &quot;Safety and Destination Recommendations,&quot; with an option to reveal more for each grouping. It does seem to provide some AI-generated summaries at the top of each heading, but at least with this example, there are fewer instances of copy/pasting another publication&#39;s words wholesale.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Web Guide has some similarities to Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html"><ins>AI Mode</ins></a>, which looped artificial intelligence more tightly into the search experience. The presence of AI Mode for all US users has already prompted outcry from publishers; News/Media Alliance called it &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/newsmedia-alliance-calls-googles-ai-mode-theft-223128521.html"><ins>theft</ins></a>.&quot; Pew Research Center recently issued a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/"><ins>report</ins></a> confirming that the presence of an AI summary at the top of a search led to fewer people clicking through to read published content from a source. The group&#39;s survey of 900 adults who shared their browsing history revealed that for users who did not see an AI summary, 15 percent of them clicked on a link from search results and 16 percent ended their browsing session. In contract, only 8 percent of users who saw an AI summary clicked a link in the search results, and 26 percent ended their browsing session. And while Google has been working to improve their accuracy, let us never forget that those AI-penned summaries once gave us <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html"><ins>glue pizza</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s too early to know if Web Guide will encourage more people to actually visit and support sites other than Google. For now, it&#39;s only available for opted-in users in the Web tab for search, but it will appear elsewhere down the line. Given that Google is already in the legal dog house for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopolist-in-search-us-judge-rules-in-antitrust-case-193358356.html"><ins>anticompetitive</ins></a> behavior with its search business, it should be interesting to see how this latest AI rollout goes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-will-use-ai-to-organize-search-results-with-web-guide-191135024.html?src=rss
