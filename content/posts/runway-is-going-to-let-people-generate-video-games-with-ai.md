<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, Runway is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube">bringing generative AI to Hollywood</a>. Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway <a href="https://play.runwayml.com/">plans to make available</a> to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO Crist&oacute;bal Valenzuela. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon's recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway's technology, and that his company is working with "pretty much every major studio" and "most of the Fortune 100 companies." </p>
