<p>The free Apple Sports app <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e80b3cae-41c2-4a86-afd3-0387249e7c5a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=just+added+widgets&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wOS9hcHBsZS1zcG9ydHMtYWRkcy13aWRnZXRzLWFuZC1leHBhbmRzLXRvLWVpZ2h0LW5ldy1jb3VudHJpZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlODBiM2NhZS00MWMyLTRhODYtYWZkMy0wMzg3MjQ5ZTdjNWEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA5L2FwcGxlLXNwb3J0cy1hZGRzLXdpZGdldHMtYW5kLWV4cGFuZHMtdG8tZWlnaHQtbmV3LWNvdW50cmllcy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYWXEbcLXyUvEG3ph9erKaLNmWNz1LI_hu3vVYbvKDGE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F09%2Fapple-sports-adds-widgets-and-expands-to-eight-new-countries%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-sports-adds-widgets-and-expands-to-eight-new-countries/">just added widgets</a>, which has been a long-requested feature. This allows users to build their own custom widgets to follow the teams and organizations of their choosing. Once placed, it&#39;ll just take a quick swipe on the device to check out scores, statistics, upcoming matches and more.</p>
<p>Widgets are available on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. This feature will operate in addition to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-sports-puts-real-time-scores-on-your-iphone-lock-screen-140050382.html">pre-existing Live Activities tool</a>, which also delivers live sports updates directly to the iPhone lock screen and the Apple Watch. That&#39;s also gotten a bit of a boost today, as Apple has announced that users can now schedule Live Activities in advance for upcoming events.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no limit on the number of widgets that can be added at once, so go crazy and put up a bunch of teams and leagues. After all, the NFL season is about to start. The app is also expanding to eight new countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The platform has added new organizations to follow throughout these regions, which are mostly soccer-related.</p>
<p>This is just the latest update for Apple Sports. The app recently started <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-apple-sports-app-now-offers-tennis-scores-just-in-time-for-wimbledon-155439959.html">offering tennis scores</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-apple-sports-app-now-lets-users-create-and-share-game-cards-184235076.html">shareable game cards</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a big week for iPhones in general. The latest operating system, iOS 26, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-is-now-available-heres-how-to-install-it-on-your-iphone-171233434.html">is now available</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">brings all kinds of stuff to the table</a>.
