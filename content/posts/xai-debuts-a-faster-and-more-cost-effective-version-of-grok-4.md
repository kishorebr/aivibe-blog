<p>A few months after the release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-4-reportedly-checks-elon-musks-views-before-offering-its-opinion-130016794.html">Grok 4</a> and an extremely problematic <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html">antisemitic meltdown</a> of its chatbot, xAI is already trying to move on with its latest AI model. Elon Musk&#39;s xAI announced the release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.ai/news/grok-4-fast">Grok 4 Fast</a>, a faster, more efficient reasoning model compared to its recent predecessor. According to xAI, Grok 4 Fast offers similar performance to Grok 4 while using 40 percent fewer thinking tokens on average.</p>
<p>Along with faster results, xAI said Grok 4 Fast &quot;results in a 98% reduction in price to achieve the same performance on frontier benchmarks as Grok 4,&quot; whether it&#39;s handling tasks that involve writing code or just browsing the web for quick responses. Similar to OpenAI&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html">GPT-5</a> that alternates between a smart, efficient model and a deeper reasoning model, xAI&#39;s latest update includes a unified architecture that can transition between handling complex requests with its &quot;reasoning&quot; model and quick responses through its &quot;non-reasoning model.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In tests on LMArena, a platform that pits AI models against each other and provides side-by-side comparisons, Grok 4 Fast ranks first in search-related tasks and eighth in text-related tasks. xAI made Grok 4 Fast available for all users, including the free ones, on web, iOS and Android. However, with how competitive the LLM race is getting, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Google releases the next-gen version of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-experimental-ai-model-gemini-25-pro-is-now-available-to-free-users-too-150005863.html">Gemini</a> or Anthropic updates the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-claude-opus-4-model-can-work-autonomously-for-nearly-a-full-workday-164526696.html">Claude</a> Opus model beyond the recently released 4.1 version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/xai-debuts-a-faster-and-more-cost-effective-version-of-grok-4-192815570.html?src=rss
