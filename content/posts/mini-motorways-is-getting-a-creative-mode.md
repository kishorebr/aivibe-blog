<p>During a showcase at Summer Games Fest, developer Dinosaur Polo Club announced that it will be adding a creative mode to <em>Mini Motorways</em>. The new mode will be available in a free game update coming to Apple Arcade, Steam, and Nintendo Switch on August 26, so you can get imaginative on whatever platform you've been playing this excellent strategy game.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html"><em><ins>Mini Metro</ins></em></a>, the core gameplay of <em>Mini Motorways</em> has a lot of calm, meditative elements in the experience of placing those first few roads. But as your city grows and the street network gets more convoluted, things can turn hectic real quick. And if you're like me, you've definitely run out of road tiles because you just couldn't stand making painfully illogical city plans. Creative Mode offers the welcome option to focus on aesthetics, letting players recolor, move and pivot houses and destinations to develop a city with more order. Or with more chaos, you do you!</p>
