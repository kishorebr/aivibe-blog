Maybe you don’t need an AI smart ring to keep up with your to-dos. Doist, the company behind Todoist, a popular to-do list app that works across multiple devices, is launching its new AI-powered, “voice-to-tasks” feature: Todoist Ramble. The feature allows you to describe your tasks using natural language.

True to its name, Ramble can take your meandering, unstructured speech and turn it into organized tasks. The app will also capture other details you mention, like project deadlines, priorities, duration, and assignees.

The idea is that people often think of things they need to do while on the go, but taking out their phone to jot down a note or create a reminder can be challenging. With Todoist Ramble, you still have to take out your phone, but you won’t have to type anything. Instead, you’ll just tap the Ramble icon and start speaking. The app will then update in real time with the task’s information, even responding to edits and changes as you speak.


	
	




	
	



For instance, the company notes you can say things like “Actually, make that Thursday” or “that’s all,” to direct the AI further as you speak. 

Ramble is built on large language models (LLMs) as part of a set of AI features that the company calls Todoist Assist, which runs on Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Live model via Vertex AI for real‑time speech understanding. As the audio streams to the back end, the model transcribes your speech and identifies the tasks, dates, and other details you mention to generate your tasks.

The audio isn’t stored or used for AI training, and the app is SOC2 Type II certified, the company, Doist, says.

The AI functionality is similar to what we’re seeing emerge across a variety of hardware AI devices, which transcribe speech to turn it into notes, reminders, to-dos, or insights. For instance, Amazon’s Bee wearable device uses AI to take notes and make suggested to-dos, while other devices, such as those from Plaud, can take
