<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">SpaceX is gearing up for the 11th flight test of its Starship megarocket, which will launch from its Starbase in Texas as early as Monday. The launch window opens on October 13 at 7:15PM ET.

The company is aiming to carry out another payload demonstration for flight 11, again using eight Starlink simulators. For this flight, SpaceX is using a previously flown Super Heavy booster, with 24 of its 33 Raptor engines being flight-proven. The goals this time around include &quot;flight experiments gathering data for the next generation Super Heavy booster, stress-testing Starship’s heatshield, and demonstrating maneuvers that will mimic the upper stage’s final approach for a future return to launch site.&quot;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">SpaceX won&#39;t attempt to </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-successfully-catches-super-heavy-booster-after-launching-starships-fifth-flight-134404103.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">catch Super Heavy in its &quot;chopsticks&quot;</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> back at the launch site this time. The booster is instead expected to end up in the Gulf of Mexico, while Starship will splash down in the Indian Ocean.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html?src=rss
