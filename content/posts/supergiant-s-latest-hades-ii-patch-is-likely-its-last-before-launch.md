<p>Despite it having upward of 61,000 reviews on Steam, <em>Hades II </em>isn’t actually out yet. The sequel to Supergiant Games’ hugely successful roguelite dungeon crawler has been in early access on PC for over a year, and even the early builds were extremely polished and content-rich for what is still a work-in-progress game. But we (and Switch owners) have been waiting patiently for that 1.0 release date, and it looks like it might be just around the corner, with Supergiant confirming that the latest Unseen Update <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512962085601150265"><ins>patch</ins></a> is likely to be the final one ahead of the full launch.</p>
<p>The third major early access <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-adds-more-combat-options-in-its-third-major-early-access-update-225206452.html"><ins>update</ins></a> arrived on June 17, and was focused primarily on combat tweaks, as well as adding a new Vow of Rivals that not only made Guardian encounters tougher, but forced players to switch up their strategies for each bout. The latest patch is mainly a host of minor adjustments to existing items and abilities, as well as some balancing on the aforementioned Vow of Rivals Encounters. No more new story content or areas are due to be added ahead of the v.10 launch, with Supergiant <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-unseen-update/"><ins>confirming</ins></a> back in June that the game’s true ending is being held back for the full release. If you’re a console player or just wanted to hold out until the game is finished, it’s probably safe to start getting excited.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, PlayStation and Xbox owners are going to have to wait a little longer, because while we still don’t know <em>Hades II</em>’s release date, we do know that the game is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/hades-ii-will-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-before-playstation-and-xbox-163757321.html"><ins>launching</ins></a> on PC and both the Switch and Switch 2 initially, mirroring the release roadmap of its predecessor. The developer has already assured fans that both Nintendo consoles can run the game at a smooth 60 fps, with the Switch 2 version benefiting from the console’s larger 1080p display in handheld mode.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/supergiants-latest-hades-ii-patch-is-likely-its-last-before-launch-190005440.html?src=rss
