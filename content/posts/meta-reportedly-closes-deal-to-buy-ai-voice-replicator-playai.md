<p>Meta has finalized the agreement to purchase <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-reportedly-looking-to-acquire-ai-voice-replicator-playai-133032491.html">Play AI</a>, a startup based in California providing users with an AI voice cloning tool, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/meta-acquires-voice-ai-startup-playai-continuing-to-add-talent?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The news organization says the &quot;entire PlayAI team&quot; is joining Meta next week, based on the internal memo it has seen. After joining the company, the team will be working under Johan Schalkwyk, who used to oversee speech AI research for Google and who was also a recent hire from another voice AI startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PlayAI&#39;s tool can clone a user&#39;s voice and can generate new human-like voices, which can be used on websites, apps and phones. Meta reportedly noted in its memo that the PlayAI team&#39;s work is a &quot;great match&quot; for its own work and roadmap across various products, including Meta AI, its AI Characters and its wearables. The company has confirmed the acquisition to <em>Bloomberg</em>, but it didn&#39;t reveal how much it paid for the deal.&nbsp;</p>
