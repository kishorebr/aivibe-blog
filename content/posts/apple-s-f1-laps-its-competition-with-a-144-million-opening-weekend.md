<p>Apple's film studio finally has a successful summer blockbuster to its name with its latest sports drama flick starring Brad Pitt. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/f1-the-movie-review-a-shameless-apple-ad-that-will-blow-your-socks-off-144808364.html"><em>F1 the Movie</em></a> saw an opening weekend that earned $144 million globally and $55.6 million domestically, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Box-Office">Comscore numbers</a>. Apple Original Films' feature beat out other highly anticipated releases like the live-action remake, <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, and the third installment in the post-apocalyptic horror film series, <em>28 Years Later. </em></p>
<p>The action-drama movie follows Pitt's character, Sonny Hayes, who's tapped to support an up-and-coming Formula One driver. With reports of the film costing up to $300 million to produce and market, <em>F1</em> <em>the Movie</em> was a risky venture for Apple, considering the lackluster performances with its other films' opening weekends like <em>Argylle</em> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fly-me-to-the-moon-trailer-plays-right-into-apollo-11-conspiracy-theorists-hands-174547851.html"><em>Fly Me to the Moon</em></a>. However, Apple's film studio gamble paid off since the opening weekend numbers for <em>F1 the Movie</em> shattered its previous records and is projected to continue its momentum. Despite the early success, Apple may have inadvertently soured some of its users on the movie, thanks to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-shoves-f1-movie-ad-into-wallet-144539">shoving an advertisement</a> for <em>F1 the Movie</em> into its Wallet app.</p>
