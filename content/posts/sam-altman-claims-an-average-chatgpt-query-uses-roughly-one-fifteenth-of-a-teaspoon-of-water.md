<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a blog post <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity">published Tuesday</a>, says an average ChatGPT query uses about 0.000085 gallons of water, or &#8220;roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon.&#8221; He made the claim as part of a broader post on his predictions about how AI will change the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,” he says. He also argues that “the cost of intelligence should eventually converge to near the cost of electricity.” OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how Altman came to those figures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI companies have come under scrutiny for energy costs of their technology. This year, for example, researchers forecast that AI could consume more power than Bitcoin mining <a href="https://www.theverge.com/climate-change/676528/ai-data-center-energy-forecast-bitcoin-mining">by the end of the year</a>. In an article <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/18/energy-ai-use-electricity-water-data-centers/">last year</a>, <em>The Washington Post</em> worked with researchers to determine that a 100-word email “generated by an AI chatbot using GPT-4” required “a little more than 1 bottle.” The publication also found that water usage can depend on where a datacenter is located.</p>
