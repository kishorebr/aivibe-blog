<p>Photo modes are a pretty common feature for video games where players go bounding around an interesting open world. Today, Minecraft <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/vibrant-memories-add-on"><ins>joined</ins></a> their ranks, making an in-game camera available in the Minecraft Marketplace as a free add-on called Vibrant Memories. The feature requires a copy of Minecraft&#39;s Bedrock Edition on any platform; the Java version doesn&#39;t appear to support the camera.</p>
<p>As well as capturing the moment as-is and saving particular camera angles to reuse later, Vibrant Memories will let a player decide whether or not to appear in the image. It will also let them set whether the weather is sunny or rainy and if the time is sunrise, sunset, day or night.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That&#39;s a pared-back take on photo mode, but then in many ways, <em>Minecraft</em> is a pared-back game. Sure, it&#39;s gotten loads of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/chase-the-skies-and-vibrant-visuals-playable-today"><ins>new</ins></a> features and creatures over the past 15 years, but at heart, it&#39;s just about mining and crafting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/minecraft-now-has-a-photo-mode-with-vibrant-memories-215948221.html?src=rss
