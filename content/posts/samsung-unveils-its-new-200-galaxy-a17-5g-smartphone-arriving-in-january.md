<p>Samsung will have two new inexpensive mobile devices <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-welcomes-galaxy-a17-5g-galaxy-tab-a11-galaxy-ecosystem/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">arriving</a> on the US market next month. The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7. Arriving on January 8, the Galaxy Tab A11+ will retail for $250.&nbsp;</p><p>The Galaxy A17 5G has a 6.7” FHD+ Super AMOLED display and is powered by the same Exynos 1330 chip found in the Galaxy A16 5G. The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD. Its 5,000mAh battery also supports fast-charging, a feature we&#39;re <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">happy to see</a> becoming more of an industry standard this year. Essentially, this is more of the same from Samsung, but this product line has a solid legacy of decent smartphones that don&#39;t break the bank. Don&#39;t be surprised if this joins our lineup of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best budget Android phones</a> come 2026.</p><p>The other new entry-level device is the Galaxy Tab A11+, which boasts an 11-inch LCD display. The rear camera is 8MP and the front one is 5MP. It has an option for 6GB of RAM with 128GB in storage, or for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here. There are many swankier tablets on the market these days, but if you&#39;re looking for a bare-bones option, this Samsung offering is a solid consideration.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-unveils-its-new-200-galaxy-a17-5g-smartphone-arriving-in-january-184846560.html?src=rss
