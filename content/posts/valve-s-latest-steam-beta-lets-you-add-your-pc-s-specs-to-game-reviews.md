<p>An upcoming update to Steam includes a helpful improvement to game reviews. As part of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053?emclan=103582791433918461&amp;emgid=505101717860253962" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Steam Client Beta update</a> Valve released on February 12, users will now be able to attach information about their hardware specifications when they post a new game review or update an old one.</p><p>It&#39;s not uncommon to find negative reviews that complain about a game&#39;s performance, information that&#39;s hard to draw a conclusion from without knowing what kind of hardware the reviewer is using. With specs attached, the usefulness of complaints becomes a little bit easier to gauge. A game&#39;s sales performance and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-steam-review-changes-perpetuate-a-vicious-cycle" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">discoverability on Steam</a> is heavily influenced by its review average, a data point Steam users sometimes manipulate for reasons unconnected to the quality of a game. Provided reviewers actually attach their specs — at least in the beta, the feature is entirely optional — Valve&#39;s mercurial reviews ecosystem could end up becoming more nuanced overall.</p><p>Alongside the new option in reviews, Valve is also experimenting with a way for users to share &quot;anonymized framerate data&quot; with the company. When framerate sharing is enabled, &quot;Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on,&quot; Valve says. The feature is specifically focused on devices running SteamOS, Valve&#39;s Linux-based operating system for the Steam Deck and some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">third-party handhelds</a>. The extra information could help the company&#39;s attempts to improve game compatibility using software like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Proton</a>.</p><p>The beta update also includes bug fixes, and a tweak to how Valve collects feedback about whether a game should be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Deck Verified</a>. Now when Steam prompts you to confirm whether you agree with a game&#39;s rating, if you disagree, you can provide a reason as to why.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-latest-steam-beta-lets-you-add-your-pcs-specs-to-game-reviews-195038078.html?src=rss
