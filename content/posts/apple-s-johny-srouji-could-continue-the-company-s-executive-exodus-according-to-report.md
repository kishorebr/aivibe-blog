<p>Apple&#39;s Johny Srouji may be the latest company executive to seek greener pastures, according to a report from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The report said that Srouji, Apple&#39;s senior vice president of hardware technologies, told Tim Cook that he is &quot;seriously considering leaving in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>While the report didn&#39;t mention if Srouji has another job lined up, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources claimed that he wants to join another company if he leaves Apple. Srouji joined the company in 2008 to develop Apple&#39;s first in-house system-on-a-chip and eventually led the transition to Apple silicon.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Srouji leaves Apple, he would be the latest in a string of departures of longtime execs. At the start of the month, Apple announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/">John Giannandrea</a>, the company&#39;s senior vice president for machine learning and AI strategy, would be retiring from his role in spring 2026. A couple of days later, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported that the company&#39;s head of interface design, Alan Dye, would be leaving for a role at Meta. Adding to those exits, Apple also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-executive-transitions/">revealed</a> that Kate Adams, who has been Apple&#39;s general counsel since 2017, and Lisa Jackson, vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will both be leaving in early 2026.</p>
<p>The shakeup at the executive level comes after <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8">Mark Gurman</a> previously reported that Cook may not be preparing for his own departure as CEO next year. Gurman&#39;s prediction counters a report from the <em>Financial Times</em> that claimed that Apple was accelerating <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-reportedly-getting-ready-to-replace-tim-cook-as-early-as-next-year-171407974.html">succession plans</a> for Cook with an expected stepping down sometime next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-johny-srouji-could-continue-the-companys-executive-exodus-according-to-report-200750252.html?src=rss
