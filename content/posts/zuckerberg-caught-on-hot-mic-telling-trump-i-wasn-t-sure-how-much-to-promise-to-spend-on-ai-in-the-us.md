<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg has certainly come a long way in his relationship with President Donald Trump. Almost exactly a year after the president threatened the Meta CEO with imprisonment, the two sat side-by-side at a White House dinner, alongside numerous other tech CEOs.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The nearly three dozen CEOs and execs in attendance took turns </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/05/trump-tech-dinner-ceo-zuckerberg-musk"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">praising and thanking</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> Trump. But Zuckerberg&#39;s comments were especially notable. In one moment that was widely shared on social media, Trump turns to Zuckerberg and asks &quot;how much are you spending, would say, over the next few years?&quot; Zuckerberg responded that it was &quot;probably going to be something like, I don&#39;t know, at least $600 billion through [20]28 in the US.&quot; Trump seemed to approve. &quot;That&#39;s a lot, thank you Mark, it&#39;s great to have you.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But it was a hot mic moment captured later between the two that was especially telling. Zuckerberg, turning to Trump, apologizes and says &quot;sorry, I wasn&#39;t ready …I wasn&#39;t sure what number you wanted to go with.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">You can watch the whole moment play out in the clip below:</span></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Zuckerberg saying Meta intends to spend at least 600 billion in the US <br><br>Zuckerberg at the end caught on a hot mic <a href="https://t.co/PZhG4slWa9">pic.twitter.com/PZhG4slWa9</a></p>— Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1964024260751761897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>

A year ago, the then-former president was threatening the Facebook founder with jail time.
