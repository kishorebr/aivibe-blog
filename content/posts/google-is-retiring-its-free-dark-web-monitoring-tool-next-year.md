<p>Google will stop sending out dark web reports starting early next year, as it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-give-users-free-dark-web-monitoring-222557429.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shuts down the free tool</a> that can tell you if your personal information has appeared on the seedy underbelly of the internet. The tool used to be exclusively available to Google One subscribers until the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-give-users-free-dark-web-monitoring-222557429.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">opened it up to everyone</a> in mid-2024. If you switch it on, you’ll receive a notification whenever your name, email address and phone number leak on the internet, typically due to data breaches. </p><p>In Google’s email announcement, however, it said it was discontinuing dark web reports because “feedback showed that it did not provide helpful next steps.” A report just lets you know that your information has appeared on the dark web. You can also see a list of all the hits you get on your Google account, along with what data breach leaked that particular detail. However, it doesn’t give you guidance on what to do afterwards. </p><p>The company explained that it will focus on tools that can give you clear, actionable step to take instead. Google will stop monitoring for new dark web results on January 15, 2026 and will remove access to the report from your account on February 16. You can also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/16767242?hl=en&amp;visit_id=639014093018233706-127073171&amp;rd=1" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">remove</a> your monitoring profile right now by going to the “results with your info” section on the tool’s official page. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-retiring-its-free-dark-web-monitoring-tool-next-year-023103252.html?src=rss
