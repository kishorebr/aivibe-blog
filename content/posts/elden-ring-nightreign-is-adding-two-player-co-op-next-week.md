<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>is finally <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727">adding a two-player co-op mode</a> on July 30. Prior to this, FromSoftware&#39;s spinoff could only be played solo or with three players. The so-called Duo Expeditions come as part of patch 1.02.</p>
<p>This is something fans have been asking for, as not everybody has two friends available at once to tackle a tough-as-nails 3D adventure. FromSoftware has released a trailer to accompany this news, so you can see the two-player co-op in action.</p>

<p>Beyond Duo Expeditions, the forthcoming patch will include &quot;quality-of-life UI improvements&quot; and options for filtering Relics. We don&#39;t know what the UI upgrades will look like, but July 30 is right around the corner.</p>
<p>This news comes just two months after the company tweaked the game to make the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-patch-will-make-gameplay-easier-for-solo-players-183644323.html">single-player experience a bit easier</a>. It had been notoriously difficult, even for fans of FromSoftware. That update introduced an automatic revival mechanic and increased rune rewards for solo expeditions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt about it. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-is-a-co-op-spinoff-coming-in-2025-015211308.html"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> is a bona-fide hit. The company also recently shared that the game <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">has reached five million players</a>. The wider Elden Ring universe is slowly but surely becoming a cultural juggernaut. There&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="http://directed/">movie in the works,</a> to be directed by Alex Garland. That&#39;s the guy who made <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Civil War</em> and the underrated TV show <em>Devs</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-is-adding-two-player-co-op-next-week-182708700.html?src=rss
