<p>Starting on October 3, Microsoft says Xbox consoles will be getting <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">yet another price bump</a>, this time ranging anywhere from a $20 increase on the company&#39;s entry-level model to $70 for a special edition model with 2TB of storage. If all of this sounds familiar, there&#39;s a good reason, the last time xbox prices were raised was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/microsoft-just-increased-all-xbox-prices-grab-one-before-the-hikes-go-into-effect-192628921.html">only a few months ago</a> in May.</p>
<p>The price increases breakdown as follows:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ul>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series S (512GB):</strong> $400, up $20 from $380</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series S (1TB):</strong> $450 up $20 from $430</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X Digital:</strong> $600, up $50 from $550</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X:</strong> $650, up $50 from $600</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition:</strong> $800, up $70 from $730</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are fairly significant increases, especially when you start comparing Microsoft&#39;s higher-end Xbox Series X consoles <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-raises-ps5-console-prices-in-the-us-153429564.html">to the competition.</a> For example, the Series X Digital (which doesn&#39;t have a disc drive) now costs $50 more than a PS5 Digital Edition. For the $800 Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition, price comparisons are even worse. It&#39;s now more expensive than the $750 PS5 Pro, and at least Sony&#39;s console gets you better performance for its high price.</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Microsoft for more information on the price changes. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>As of right now, Microsoft credits the need to raise prices on &quot;changes in the macroeconomic environment,&quot; which likely has to do with the impact <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo">tariffs</a> implemented by the Trump administration are having on importing electronics into the US. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that the company has also been shifting its focus away from home consoles in favor of bringing the &quot;Xbox experience&quot; to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, that&#39;s just by publishing formerly Xbox exclusive games <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-confirms-four-of-its-games-are-coming-to-more-popular-consoles-201419203.html">on the PS5 and Switch</a>, but it also includes creating <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-handhelds-will-be-available-october-16-but-we-still-dont-know-the-price-134015698.html">the first Xbox handheld</a> with ASUS and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-and-lg-are-bringing-cloud-gaming-to-cars-133016305.html">emphasizing Xbox game streaming</a> wherever it makes sense. Given the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-series-s-starter-bundle-is-on-sale-for-220-153432765.html">frequent sales</a> on the Xbox Series S, there&#39;s a world where Microsoft&#39;s entry-level console might still be worth considering. For anything else, though, streaming or waiting for games to come to other platforms increasingly seems like it makes the most financial sense.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html?src=rss
