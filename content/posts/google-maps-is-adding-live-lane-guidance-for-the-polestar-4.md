<p>Google <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/polestar-live-lane-guidance/">is bringing</a> live lane guidance to Google Maps in cars with the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html">built-in</a> infotainment system, starting with the<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-4-first-look-when-no-rear-window-makes-for-a-better-car-150052884.html"> Polestar 4</a>. Using the vehicle&#39;s front-facing camera, Google Maps will be able to &quot;see&quot; the road just as the driver does. It will then create more detailed depictions of which lane a driver should be in and guide them using visual and audio cues.</p>
<p>Google says the new feature uses AI to analyze lane markings and road signs, which it then integrates in real time with Google Maps&#39; navigation system. Google paints a picture of fewer missed exits, as its navigation system reminds drivers in the left lane that their exit is coming up on the right side of the highway.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Details are scarce on where exactly this will function. In Google&#39;s blog post announcing the feature, the company says it will expand live lane guidance to &quot;more road types&quot; in the future. We&#39;ve reached out for clarification.</p>
<p>Live lane guidance with Google Maps will be rolling out on the Polestar 4 in the US and Sweden over the coming months. Google says it will expand to include more cars in partnership with other automakers.</p>
<p><strong>Update Nov 4 3:39 PM EST: Google says the feature will only work on highways for now.</strong></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/google-maps-is-adding-live-lane-guidance-for-the-polestar-4-192705050.html?src=rss
