<p>Adobe launched its own take on how smartphone cameras should work this week with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d34ffe8b-ccc0-4671-b064-c80f8d4e0b8b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Project+Indigo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9wcm9qZWN0LWluZGlnby9pZDY3NDI1OTE1NDYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQzNGZmZThiLWNjYzAtNDY3MS1iMDY0LWM4MGY4ZDRlMGI4YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvcHJvamVjdC1pbmRpZ28vaWQ2NzQyNTkxNTQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUrdxlXDpknEgn6ff12EFXTxKzHl7H79f1oVy441yuz7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fproject-indigo%2Fid6742591546" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-indigo/id6742591546">Project Indigo</a>, a new iPhone camera app from some of the team behind the Pixel camera. The project combines the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-upscaled-computational-photography-pixel-deep-fusion-explainer.html">computational photography</a> techniques that engineers Marc Levoy and Florian Kainz popularized at Google, with pro controls and new AI-powered features.</p>
<p>In their <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://research.adobe.com/articles/indigo/indigo.html">announcement</a> of the new app, Levoy and Kainz style Project Indigo as the better answer to typical smartphone camera complaints of limited controls and over-processing. Rather than using aggressive tone mapping and sharpening, Project Indigo is supposed to use "only mild tone mapping, boosting of color saturation, and sharpening." That's intentionally not the same as the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/iphone-camera-app-halide-has-an-anti-intelligent-mode-to-make-shooting-with-raw-easier-211802575.html">"zero-processing"</a> approach some third-party apps are taking. "Based on our conversations with photographers, what they really want is not zero-process but a more natural look — more like what an SLR might produce," Levoy and Kainz write.</p>

<p>The new app also has fully manual controls, "and the highest image quality that computational photography can provide," whether you want a JPEG or a RAW file at the end. Project Indigo achieves that by dramatically under-exposing the shots it combines together, and relying on a larger number of shots to combine — up to 32 frames, according to Levoy and Kainz. The app also includes some of Adobe's more <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/adobes-new-photoshop-tool-can-clean-away-window-reflections-235855968.html">experimental photo features</a>, like "Remove Reflections," which uses AI to eliminate reflections from photos.</p>
<p>Levoy <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/marc-levoy-leaves-google-pixel-camera-160633238.html">left Google in 2020</a>, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/marc-levoy-joins-adobe-universal-camera-app-205930360.html">joined Adobe</a> a few months later to form a team with the express goal of building a "universal camera app". Based on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-kainz-4736657/">his LinkedIn</a>, Kainz joined Adobe that same year. At Google, Kainz and Levoy were often credited with popularizing the concept of computational photography, where camera apps rely more on software than hardware to produce quality smartphone photos. Google's success in that arena kicked off a camera arms race that's raised the bar everywhere, but also led to some pretty over-the-top photos. Project Indigo is a bit of a corrective, and also an interesting test whether a third-party app that might produce better photos is enough to beat the default.</p>
<p>Project Indigo is available to download for free now, and runs on either the iPhone 12 Pro and up, or the iPhone 14 and up. An Android version of the app is coming at some point in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobe-project-indigo-is-a-new-photo-app-from-former-pixel-camera-engineers-213453207.html?src=rss
