<p>LG usually announces its CES TV lineup well ahead of the show, but this year the company had a surprise at CES 2026: The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">return of its ultra-thin &quot;Wallpaper&quot; TV</a>. Now it&#39;s toting a gorgeous OLED screen and wireless connectivity, and it&#39;s about as thin as a pencil. We got a chance to check out the Wallpaper TV in action during a CES preview event, as well as the previously announced Gallery and Micro RGB sets. LG still has its typically OLED and LED sets around, but it&#39;s clear that 2026 will be filled with intriguing TVs for a variety of consumers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" style="height:1396px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV" data-uuid="58f3d374-411f-4f30-ace0-0a163a26875f"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="831aff76-954b-413f-ad53-1c525ef027ff">The Wallpaper TV (LG W6)</h2><p>If money were no object, I&#39;d want a 100-inch LG Wallpaper TV in my family room immediately. It looks shockingly thin in person — almost as if it&#39;s some sort of sci-fi prop — and it delivers the rich colors and dark levels we expect from OLED. Cable management is also a cinch, since it requires just a single power cable. The A/V inputs are handled by LG&#39;s One Connect box, which you can position wirelessly up to 10 meters away from the TV. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" style="height:1333px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear" data-uuid="76d95849-a1b3-4ee2-b3e8-944800c0dba6"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The LG W6 combines the best of LG&#39;s OLED technology, including &quot;Hyper Radiant Color&quot; for improved black levels and color, &quot;Brightness Booster Ultra&quot; to crank up luminance 3.9 times more than conventional OLEDs and a reflection free screen material. LG&#39;s Alpha 9 Gen 3 processor beefs up its performance, and its NPU also helps to improve upscaling and overall image performance. (And yes, you can also access generative AI features via Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.)</p><p>All of that adds up to one of the most remarkable TVs I&#39;ve seen in years. I haven&#39;t been too enamored with other TV gimmicks lately, like everything trying to mimic Samsung&#39;s The Frame, or the usless 8K sets. But a super-thin wireless TV with the best OLED panel available? That&#39;s the stuff dreams are made of. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" style="height:1253px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV" data-uuid="3419e13f-8e77-4dd1-8a33-97994b44a84c"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="c4158606-b48b-431e-b6d6-e9e573054349">The Gallery TV competes with Samsung’s Frame</h2><p>While LG has made Gallery TVs before, in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2026 it&#39;s making a more concerted effort</a> to take on Samsung&#39;s popular Frame TV. LG says the new sets were designed with the help of museum curators, which helps the &quot;Gallery Mode&quot; adjust brightness and contrast to specific works of art. They also ship with magnetic frame-like bezels, and they have anti-reflective screens to help make the art shine. </p><p>In person, the new Gallery TV looks fine, though it&#39;s easy to tell that the colors and contrast levels don&#39;t match LG&#39;s premium OLED TVs.  To avoid burn-in issues, these sets feature Mini LED panels. As I noted above, I&#39;m not the core consumer for one of these TVs, but it&#39;s nice to see more competition against Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs. (Despite pioneering the idea of TVs displaying art, the Frame sets are still fairly mediocre when it comes to actually watching TV shows and movies.) </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" style="height:1316px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="72bf06b4-100f-4522-a0be-2025ac961562"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="0b43ff1a-5c6e-434e-b754-a7d35f025952"><strong>Micro RGB looks like a genuine Mini LED upgrade</strong></h2><p>As if we needed more TV acronyms to worry about, say hello to Micro RGB, a new technology built atop Mini LED to cover vastly more color range. Just don&#39;t confuse it with Micro LED, which is the wildly expensive evolutionary step forward for OLED. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG already announced its Micro RGB set</a> a few weeks ago, but that didn&#39;t prepare me for standing in front of the 100-inch demo TV it brought to CES. Throughout a variety of clips, colors looked wonderfully rich, and the overall texture of the images looked surprisingly life-like. </p><p>I&#39;d have to compare it to LG&#39;s Wall TV side-by-side to truly see how Micro RGB competes with OLED, but technically OLED should still offer better contrast and black levels, since each of its pixels are self-emissive. But sure, if I couldn&#39;t get a 100-inch Wall TV in my family room, I certainly wouldn&#39;t turn down an enormous Micro RGB. </p><h2 id="c5a82153-d91f-4549-93d2-6ed9c5eee16d"><strong>What about LG&#39;s other OLED TVs?</strong></h2><p>All of the next-generation OLED technology in the wallpaper TV will also make its way into LG&#39;s G6 OLED models, while the new C6 and other lines will see improvements of their own. All I can say is that the new G6 OLED looked impressive, with a noticeably brighter picture and HDR elements compared to G-series OLEDs from several years ago.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html?src=rss
