<p>Instead of digging through all the top search results, you can now ask Google Search to give you a comprehensive AI-generated summary with its Audio Overviews feature. The AI feature uses Google Gemini models to create a short audio clip that sounds like a conversational podcast with two hosts.</p>
<p>It's not ideal for your basic search queries like finding out when Father's Day is, but it's helpful if you want an in-depth and hands-free response to the history and significance of Flag Day. The Audio Overviews option pulls from the front page Google Search results and compiles them into an audio summary where two voices bounce off each other for a more engaging answer. You can also adjust the volume and playback speed between 0.25x and 2x. Audio Overviews even includes the webpages it pulls the info from, letting you continue down the Google Search rabbit hole.</p>
