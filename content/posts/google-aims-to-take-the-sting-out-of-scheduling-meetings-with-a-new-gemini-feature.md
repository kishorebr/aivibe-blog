<p>Google is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2026/01/improved-meeting-suggestions-gemini-calendar.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">rolling out</a> a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-pull-context-the-rest-of-your-google-apps-if-you-let-it-160039468.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Gemini</a> feature that could turn out to be pretty useful for many folks. It&#39;s a Google Calendar tool that can help figure out the best time to schedule a meeting, taking into account attendees&#39; schedules. When creating a meeting, you can click the &quot;Suggested times&quot; option and Gemini will look at the availability that people have marked on their calendar and potential conflicts. You&#39;ll then be able to choose from a list of suggested time slots.</p><p>But the time you pick may not work for everyone. So if multiple people decline the meeting invite, you can reschedule by going to the event. You&#39;ll see a time when everyone is available and you can quickly update the invite.</p><p>There are a few catches here. Naturally, this will only work properly when meeting organizers have access to attendees&#39; calendars. It&#39;s also limited to paid users who are on Google Workspace Business (Standard and Plus) and Enterprise (Standard and Plus) plans, as well as those with the Google AI Pro for Education add-on. The feature is available now on Rapid Release domains and it&#39;ll start rolling out to Scheduled Release domains on February 2.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-aims-to-take-the-sting-out-of-scheduling-meetings-with-a-new-gemini-feature-204853761.html?src=rss
