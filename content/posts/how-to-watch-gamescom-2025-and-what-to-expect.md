<p>It feels like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-new-at-summer-game-fest-2025-xbox-handheld-resident-evil-requiem-and-more-185425578.html">Summer Game Fest</a> is only just in our rear view mirror and yet there's another video game extravaganza on the horizon. Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for <em>The Division 2</em>. The company will <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1955638110798201174">host two panels</a> related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about <em>The Division Resurgence</em> (<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-its-rainbow-six-and-division-mobile-games-until-at-least-april-2025-174035060.html">a delayed mobile game</a>), as well details about a "big Division 2 project."</p>
<p>We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.</p>

<p>Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the "worldwide reveal" of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </em>We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.</p>
<p>Given that Microsoft has said <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/that-one-time-i-played-hollow-knight-silksong-160022483.html">over six years after we first got to try it out</a>. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete <em>Silksong </em>news at Gamescom.</p>
<p>You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG <em>Honor of Kings: World, </em>along with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.gematsu.com/event/gamescom-2025-opening-night-live">new looks</a> at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> and<em> The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. </em>You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the <em>World of Warcraft:</em> <em>Midnight</em> expansion as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's <em>Fallout </em>series, which will arrive in December.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.</p>

<p>One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-will-be-released-during-the-2025-holiday-season-142135533.html">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a> handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">reported</a> the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.</p>
<p>Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular event will feature the likes of <em>Grounded 2, </em><a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/psychonauts-developers-trippy-island-adventure-keeper-comes-out-on-october-17-193405665.html"><em>Keeper</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. <em>The Order of Giants</em>, an expansion for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, </em>will be showcased alongside <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2</em> and<em> Starsand Island.</em></p>
<p>Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.</p>

<p>Actors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in <em>Resident Evil Village</em>) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://x.com/FutureGamesShow/status/1956386039100059799">confirmed</a> to make an appearance here, including <em>Skate </em>(which is slated to <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/after-a-15-year-hiatus-a-new-skate-game-is-coming-in-2025-182125136.html">hit early access this year</a>), <em>Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer &amp; Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em> and <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/"><em>Katanaut</em></a>.

<p>Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on <em>Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Overwatch 2</em> (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also expect looks at <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> and <em>Fragpunk</em>.
