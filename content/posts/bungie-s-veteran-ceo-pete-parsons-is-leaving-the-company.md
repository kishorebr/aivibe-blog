<p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">has announced</a> that he&#39;s leaving the <em>Halo </em>developer after working at the studio for more than two decades. In Parsons&#39; place, Justin Truman, a general manager on <em>Destiny 2</em> and Bungie&#39;s chief development officer, is taking over as studio head.</p>
<p>&quot;After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,&quot; Parsons shared in a statement on Bungie&#39;s website. &quot;Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders, and I am thrilled to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping into leadership as Bungie&#39;s new studio head.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Parsons oversaw Bungie during a consequential period in the studio&#39;s history. Bungie started <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-10-bungie-takes-control-of-publishing-destiny.html">publishing its own games</a> under his leadership, ending a longterm publishing deal with Activision that helped get <em>Destiny </em>released. Parsons also played a role in the studio&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-closes-bungie-acquisition-playstation-studios-190623763.html">$3.6 million acquisition</a> by Sony, which placed Bungie at the center of plans to develop <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026">live-service games for the PlayStation</a> â€” a move that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/concord-is-going-offline-two-weeks-after-its-ps5-and-pc-launch-163134728.html">hasn&#39;t really paid off</a> so far.</p>
<p>Bungie has faced notable difficulties since coming under Sony ownership. The studio&#39;s relative independence did nothing to spare it from having to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-is-laying-off-220-employees-200242815.html">lay off 220 employees</a> in 2024. Developing Bungie&#39;s next game, <em>Marathon, </em>has also seemed like an uphill battle. The game was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-delays-marathon-indefinitely-190832450.html">delayed indefinitely</a> earlier this year following the discovery that the alpha version of <em>Marathon </em>used <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungie-admits-its-marathon-alpha-included-stolen-artwork-210006323.html">stolen art assets</a>.</p>
<p>Truman&#39;s new leadership role suggests <em>Destiny 2</em> will remain a going concern for Bungie. It might also signal a new relationship with Sony and PlayStation Studios. During a recent earnings call, Sony CFO Lin Tao said Bungie would be less independent in the future, and eventually &quot;become part of PlayStation Studios,&quot; <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-has-seen-enough-3-years-after-acquiring-bungie-sony-says-the-days-of-independence-are-over-and-its-future-is-to-become-part-of-playstation-studios/"><em>PC Gamer </em>reports</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-veteran-ceo-pete-parsons-is-leaving-the-company-213626001.html?src=rss
