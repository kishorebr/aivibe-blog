<p>After years of testing its humanoid robot (and<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/watch-the-atlas-robot-bust-a-move-in-boston-dynamics-latest-video-211329951.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"> forcing it to dance</a>), Boston Dynamics&#39; Atlas is<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-unveils-new-atlas-robot-to-revolutionize-industry/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"> entering production</a>. The robotics company said at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">CES 2026</a> that the final product version of the robot is being built now, and the first companies that will receive deployments are Hyundai, Boston Dynamics&#39; majority shareholder, and Google DeepMind, the firm&#39;s<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"> newly minted AI partner.</a></p><p>This final enterprise version of Atlas &quot;can perform a wide array of industrial tasks,&quot; according to Boston Dynamics, and is specifically designed with consistency and reliability in mind. Atlas can work autonomously, via a teleoperator or with &quot;a tablet steering interface,&quot; and the robot is both strong and durable. Boston Dynamics says Atlas has a reach of up to 7.5 feet, the ability to lift 110 pounds and can operate at temperatures ranging from minus 4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. &quot;This is the best robot we have ever built,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said in the Atlas announcement. &quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Boston Dynamics has been publicly demoing its work on humanoid robots since at least 2011, when <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-12-darpa-atlas.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">it first debuted Atlas</a> as a DARPA project. Since then, the robot has gone through multiple prototypes and revisions, most notably switching from a hydraulic design to an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-unveils-an-all-electric-version-of-its-atlas-robot-151513244.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">all-electric design</a> in 2024. Later that year, Boston Dynamics <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-can-now-pick-car-parts-on-its-own-170052539.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">demonstrated</a> the robot&#39;s ability to manipulate car parts, which appears to be one of the first ways Atlas will be put to work.</p><p>Hyundai <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-can-now-pick-car-parts-on-its-own-170052539.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">plans to use Atlas</a> in its car plants in 2028, focused on tasks like parts sequencing. In 2030, the car maker hopes to have the robot&#39;s responsibilities &quot;extend to component assembly, and over time, Atlas will also take on tasks involving repetitive motions, heavy loads, and other complex operations,&quot; Hyundai says. Google DeepMind, meanwhile, is receiving Atlas robots so it can work on integrating its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepminds-latest-ai-model-can-help-robots-fold-origami-and-close-ziploc-bags-151455249.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Gemini Robotics</a> AI foundation models into Boston Dynamics&#39; system. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html?src=rss
