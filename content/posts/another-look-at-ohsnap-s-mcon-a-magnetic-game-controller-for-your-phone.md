<p>OhSnap <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/i-adore-this-clever-mobile-gamepad-with-hall-effect-sticks-and-a-snap-up-design-110007990.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">won our hearts</a> (and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2025-the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-saw-in-las-vegas-211535722.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a best of CES award</a>) last year with the MCON, its tiny Bluetooth game pad that magnetically connects to your phone. At the time, we tried a pre-production unit, but in the year since the MCON has been finalized and went on sale last month. I just got a chance to try the final version here at CES, and just a quick demo was enough to convince me that OhSnap has made some solid refinements over the last year.</p><p>Just as we saw last year, the MCON attaches magnetically to an iPhone or any compatible Android phone (the company also includes a magnetic ring in the box for Androids that don’t have Qi2 yet). It has the full array of controls, including four face buttons, a D-pad, two joysticks and index finger buttons and full bumpers. It’s just sleeker and feels more solid than last year’s prototype, and while mounting your makes it feel a bit top-heavy, it’s not awkward enough to cause real issues when playuing (at least that’s how I felt after my brief demo).</p><p>The controller also has grips that unfold to help balance things, and the plate that attaches your phone to the controller has a kickstand. So if you want to drop your phone down on a tray table on a plane and play just holding the controller, feel free. All in all, the MCON feels like a flexible and high-quality device that’s probably worth the $150 OhSnap asks for it.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF8995.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF8995.jpg" style="height:1353px;width:2400px;" alt="The MCON dock connects your phone to your TV for full-screen gameplay." data-uuid="24ca9326-6388-44bc-a72d-da6d047386c7"/><figcaption>The MCON dock connects your phone to your TV for full-screen gameplay.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The company also has some new accessories to show off. There’s a $70 TV dock that powers your phone and outputs video from USB-C to HDMI. You could use this dock with any Bluetooth controller hooked up to your mobile phone, not just the MCON. There’s also a tiny $30 adapter you can put on your keychain that has a USB-C plug that goes into your phone; plug an HDMI cable into the other end and you can broadcast your games to a TV anywhere you go and play them with a controller.</p><p>It’s a pretty clever and comprehensive set of products, and while there are tons of mobile game controllers, the OhSnap feels like one of the more portable and sleek options out there. OhSnap is working on something even slimmer, though. The company showed off two new prototype controllers, the MCON Lite and MCON Slim. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9017.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9017.jpg" style="height:1353px;width:2400px;" alt="OhSnap is working on two new MCON controller that are more compact than the original." data-uuid="54f99c98-d417-48c0-8b67-06979d847800"/><figcaption>OhSnap is working on two new MCON controller that are more compact than the original.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As the names suggest, they’re both more compact than the original model. The Lite uses concave joypads rather than full sticks, and the Slim makes things even smaller by using concave touch pads. Your’e not going to get quite the same quality experience with those as you would with the bigger version, but they are noticeably thinner; OhSnap says they’ll be cheaper, too. The MCON Lite is scheduled to arrive this summer, while the Slim should launch in the fall (around the same time as the iPhone 18).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html?src=rss
