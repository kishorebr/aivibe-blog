<p>Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators, AI assistants and rolling robots. But for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1766177037453611&amp;usg=AOvVaw2s0tafHDwWnqYKUQHC4zuC">CES 2026</a>, the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping hints about what&#39;s on the agenda, but what we&#39;re really hoping to see is an update on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html">Ballie robot</a> — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html">2025 release date</a>.</p>

<p>The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">Samsung Newsroom</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung">Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel</a> or via Samsung TV Plus. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)</p>

<p>Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &quot;new AI-driven customer experiences,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look">said in a press release</a>. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &quot;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&quot;</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its &quot;Advent calendar&quot; approach to early CES announcements, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">new press releases</a> dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html">LG</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html">Hisense</a> — the company will be offering details on a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">micro RGB TVs</a> (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026">Bespoke AI</a>. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html">Music Studio 5 and 7</a>, at CES this year. Additionally, it&#39;ll debut its latest <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html">Freestyle+ portable projector</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html">Odyssey gaming monitor</a>. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen <em>and</em> has glasses-free 3D. It&#39;s likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.</p>
<p>Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we&#39;ll keep updating this story as it does.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss
