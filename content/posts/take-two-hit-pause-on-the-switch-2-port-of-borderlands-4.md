<p>2K owner Take-Two has paused development on <em>Borderlands 4 </em>for the Nintendo Switch 2, the company shared during its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Q3 2026 earnings presentation</a>. The Switch 2 port was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-owners-can-play-borderlands-4-on-october-3-200651283.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">originally planned to be released</a> on October 3, 2025, a few weeks after the game&#39;s September 12 launch on all other platforms, but was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">indefinitely delayed</a> on September 23.</p><p>&quot;We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Take-Two told <em>Variety</em></a>. &quot;Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em>, and we&#39;re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.&quot;</p><p>When the <em>Borderlands 4</em> Switch 2 port was originally delayed, the game&#39;s developer Gearbox shared that the port needed &quot;additional development and polish time&quot; and that it hoped to &quot;better align this release with the addition of cross saves.&quot; In Take-Two&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Q2 earnings presentation</a> on November 6, 2025, the Switch 2 port was still listed as having a &quot;TBA&quot; release date. The lack of mention in the company&#39;s Q3 presentation and Take-Two&#39;s comment to <em>Variety</em> pretty much confirm that if a Switch 2 version happens, it won&#39;t be anytime soon. The official <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Borderlands 4</em> post-release content roadmap</a> currently lists plans for paid and free story DLC and raid bosses, but nothing related to additional ports of the game.</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>&#39;s planned <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">November 19 release date</a> is still on the books, however. Rockstar Games&#39; next blockbuster title was originally<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1"> supposed to be released in fall 2025</a>, before it was delayed to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">May 2026</a> last May. The game was delayed a second and final time — at least for now — in November 2025, to its current November 2026 release date. </p><p>There&#39;s still room for another delay, but in the earnings statement Take-Two projected confidence, sharing that Rockstar would start marketing the game this summer. The franchise remains a cash cow, so it’s only natural the company would want to get the rollout of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> right. As part of its earnings presentation, Take-Two shared that <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, which was originally released all the way back in 2013, has sold 225 million units.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/take-two-hit-pause-on-the-switch-2-port-of-borderlands-4-222546776.html?src=rss
