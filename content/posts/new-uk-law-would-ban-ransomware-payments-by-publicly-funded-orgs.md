<p>The British government <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-lead-crackdown-on-cyber-criminals-with-ransomware-measures"><ins>has announced plans</ins></a> to move forward with a law that would bar public organizations from paying off ransomware attackers. The proposed legislation would add schools, town councils, National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and critical infrastructure managers to a ban which already applies to the national government.</p>
<p>The logic behind banning payments is simple. If cybercriminals know a ransomware attack against a UK school or hospital won&#39;t get them paid, they&#39;ll look somewhere else for a more lucrative target. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said that the government is &quot;determined to smash the cyber criminal business model,&quot; and added that laws in the proposed package will require even private businesses to seek guidance from the government before paying a ransom.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since the WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 launched the modern era of ransomware attacks, the UK has suffered a number of serious incidents. In <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://trustco.co.uk/top-10-uk-cyber-attacks-of-2024/"><ins>the last two years alone</ins></a>, attacks have hit the British Library, the BBC and the Ministry of Defence. This may explain why, according to the government&#39;s announcement, &quot;nearly three quarters&quot; of public comments on the ban legislation were supportive.</p>
<p>Although bans on ransom payments are a popular solution to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.sygnia.co/blog/ransomware-attacks-2024/"><ins>ever-increasing scourge</ins></a> of ransomware, there&#39;s currently not much data on whether they work. Two US states, North Carolina and Florida, have enacted similar bans, but <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.govtech.com/security/should-state-governments-ban-ransomware-payments"><ins>it&#39;s hard to say what impact they&#39;ve had</ins></a>. Critics argue that some organizations, especially hospitals, can&#39;t afford the long-term disruption of leaving the ransom unpaid, and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://techinformed.com/should-the-uk-ban-ransomware-or-follow-australias-lead/"><ins>may choose to pay in unaccountable ways</ins></a>. Furthermore, some hacking groups have aims other than money, and may continue ransomware attacks <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/new-paper-assessing-political-motivations-behind-ransomware-attacks"><ins>to sow political chaos</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The UK is moving into uncharted territory as the first nation to pass a ransomware payment ban. We&#39;ll be interested to see whether it helps get attacks under control. Either way, the outcome is likely to inform how other countries respond to the continuing threat of cybercrime.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-uk-law-would-ban-ransomware-payments-by-publicly-funded-orgs-210851334.html?src=rss
