<p>Android phones that support Qi2 wireless chargers that are magnetically secured in place might finally be hitting the market. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-qi-2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories-3566103/"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a> reports that Google plans to add Qi2 charging with the upcoming Google Pixel 10. The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/qi-2-charging-borrowed-from-apple-is-coming-to-android-phones-in-2023-114738401.html"><ins>Qi2 standard was announced</ins></a> at CES in 2023, and was developed with substantial contributions from <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/apple/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Apple_Inc." data-original-link="">Apple</a>. The new design iterated on the Qi standard by adding magnets that would help ensure a perfect alignment, among other improvements. That magnetic alignment tech was built on Apple&#39;s MagSafe technology.</p>
<p>There was a lot of excitement around the standard coming to the Android ecosystem, but <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/android-phone-makers-dropped-the-ball-on-qi2-in-2024-191029769.html"><ins>manufacturers dropped the ball</ins></a>. Displaying a total lack of urgency in implementing the standard, not a single Android device made by Samsung, Google or Motorola supported Qi2 in 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team at <em>Android Authority</em> reports that they have “viewed credible marketing materials intended for retailers that show that Google is working on a few magnetic Qi2 accessories meant for the upcoming Pixel 10.” They suggest Google will name the magnetic ecosystem “Pixelsnap” and at least three accessories to start. A Pixelsnap Charger, Charger with Stand and Ring Stand are set to be in the works for the new Pixel 10. Assuming that magnetic profiles are included as rumored, the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand sounds like the successor to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-stand-2nd-gen-pre-order-172720920.html"><ins>Google’s Pixel Stand</ins></a>. This would ostensibly allow users to magnetically snap their phones to the stand while the phone charges wirelessly.</p>
<p><em>Android Authority</em> reports that the Pixel 10 would support Qi 2.2, with a maximum hardware-supported charge rate of 60W, though Google will ultimately decide what rate of charging will be allowed on each compatible phone model.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixelsnap-googles-belated-answer-to-magsafe-could-arrive-alongside-the-pixel-10-184527063.html?src=rss
