<p>Just like buying a new iPhone through Apple&#39;s online store, you now select each spec of your new Mac device when purchasing through the website. As first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3048329/apple-just-completely-changed-how-you-buy-a-new-mac.html"><em>MacWorld</em></a>, Apple updated its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro">online configuration tool</a> for purchasing a Mac. Compared to the previous design that allowed you to pick between several prebuilt options, the new configurator lets you choose one spec after another instead.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a major difference compared to choosing between preconfigured options, but interested buyers have more customization since they can select the color, display, chip, memory, storage and even power adapter. The updated page also gives customers the option to add pre-installed apps, like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro, to their new Mac.</p>
