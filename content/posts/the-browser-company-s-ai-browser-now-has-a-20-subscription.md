<p class="has-text-align-none">The Browser Company — the makers of the Arc browser — just launched <a href="https://www.diabrowser.com/pro">a $20 per month subscription</a> to its new AI-powered web browser, Dia, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/the-browser-company-launches-a-20-monthly-subscription-for-its-ai-powered-browser/">reported earlier by <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The new Dia Pro subscription comes with unlimited access to the browser’s chat feature, which lets you ask questions about the content in your tabs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People who use Dia for free will still have access to the same features the browser launched with, including the ability to interact with the browser’s AI chatbot and create custom skills. But free users might run into some limits if they frequently use Dia’s AI chat feature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Browser Company hasn’t carved out specific limits for non-subscribers, but CEO Josh Miller told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/technology/personaltech/ai-internet-browser-dia.html"><em>The New York Times </em>last month that</a> “the browser will remain free for those who use the A.I. tool only a few times a week.” Miller also hinted at rolling out additional subscription tiers, ranging from $5 to hundreds of dollars per month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Browser Company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310944/dia-ai-browser-video-arc-the-browser-company">first announced the development</a> of Dia late last year before launching it in beta in June. Over the past several months, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/google/673659/gemini-google-chrome-integration-agentic-era">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714435/microsoft-edge-copilot-mode-ai-features">Microsoft</a> have begun knitting AI more tightly into their browsers, while the AI search startup Perplexity has released an early access <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709025/perplexity-comet-ai-browser-chrome-competitor">version of its AI browser Comet</a>. Rumors also suggest that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704162/opeani-ai-web-browser-chatgpt">OpenAI is getting ready to release</a> an AI web browser of its own.</p>
