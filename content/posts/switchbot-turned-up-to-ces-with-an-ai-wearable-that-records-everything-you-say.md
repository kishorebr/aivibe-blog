<p>We’ve all fantasied about sprawling on an embroidered chaise lounge while our amanuensis faithfully typed out everything we said. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://jetstream.blog/en/switchbot-new-products-ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">SwitchBot</a> turned up to CES with something that does a similar job, but without the romance of the amanuensis, the typewriter or the chaise lounge. Instead, it’s launching the AI MindClip, a wearable microphone which records and transcribes every noise to come from your mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>The company isn’t alone, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">many others</a> turning up to CES this year offering devices to log your thoughts through the day.

The company’s representatives said it will use its initiative and create its own reminders based on what it thinks you’ll need to remember. Sadly, we couldn’t get to see it working in person, and we don’t know when it’ll be available or how much it’ll cost.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>But it’ll probably be a little bit cheaper than a chaise lounge.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/switchbot-turned-up-to-ces-with-an-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say-014959824.html?src=rss
