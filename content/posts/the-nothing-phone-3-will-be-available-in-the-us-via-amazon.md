<p>The Nothing Phone 3 is getting an official release for US customers. The handset will be available to purchase from Amazon or directly from the company, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/nothings-new-phone-3-will-be-available-on-general-sale-in-the-us/">according to a report by <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Nothing CEO Carl Pei <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/1917040614304264507?t=hV3GdAdxhnBK4zpAQKDtZQ&amp;s=19">has been teasing this news</a> since April, but now it&#39;s official.</p>
<p>Canadians will also be able to get in on the retail action, as Nothing has inked a deal with Best Buy to sell the new handset in the region. The phone <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-nothing-phone-3-arrives-in-july-134121908.html">goes on sale next month</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has produced eight handsets since forming back in 2020, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-2-review-an-offbeat-alternative-to-boring-midrange-phones-specs-price-160002218.html">but only the Phone 2</a> has made it to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/nothings-phone-2-is-up-for-pre-order-starting-at-599/">general sale in the US</a>. For the other models, users would have to buy a unit via a beta program and there was no after-sale support. So this is good news for North Americans who are tired of Samsung and Apple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The smartphone market in the US is dominated by two players, but a lot of people are hungry for something different,” Pei told <em>TechCrunch</em>. &quot;This is the right product, and the right moment, to start scaling in North America.&quot;</p>
<p>The downside here? The phone will only be available from Amazon and Nothing, so there will be no option to purchase from a carrier for a discount. However, it&#39;ll support 4G and 5G with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. There&#39;s no explicit support for Verizon, but the Phone 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/23803460/nothing-phone-2-verizon-works-okay-wouldnt-depend-on-it">worked well with its network</a> and the same thing will likely be true here.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no official US price yet. Pei recently said that it would cost £800 in England at launch, which would translate to around $1,080 in US dollars. This is far and away the most expensive handset the company has ever released, as it has primarily been known for <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html">mid-tier offerings</a>. Pei says the higher cost accounts for &quot;premium materials, major performance upgrades and software that really levels things up.&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have actual specs yet, but a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/nothing-phones/the-latest-nothing-phone-3-leak-hints-at-chipset-camera-and-battery-specifications">recent leak certainly points</a> to the kind of leveled up experience Pei was talking about. A reliable leaker suggested that it&#39;ll include a &quot;flagship Snapdragon chipset&quot; from Qualcomm and a new camera system with a triple-lens module on the rear. The battery is also reportedly on the larger side, with indications it&#39;ll likely exceed the 5,000 mAh mark. The Nothing Phone 2 shipped with a 4,700 mAh battery.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only product the company is bringing stateside. It&#39;s making some <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668395/nothing-is-making-over-ears">over-ear headphones</a> that will be available to purchase for US and Canadian residents.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-nothing-phone-3-will-be-available-in-the-us-via-amazon-184534970.html?src=rss
