<p>Gamers who prefer <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-nes-game-jaws-is-getting-a-retro-physical-re-release-on-switch-and-ps5-221052996.html">physical copies</a> of their favorite titles may be getting a major win with the Switch 2. In an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mae7ilx6r22f">unexpected announcement</a> from retro video game publisher ININ Games, Nintendo reportedly has &quot;two new smaller cartridge sizes&quot; for its Switch 2 console. For ININ Games, these rumored game cartridges with smaller storage capacity allow the publisher to recalculate production costs and pursue a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002060129512947968?s=20">physical Switch 2 release</a> of its upcoming <em>R-Type Dimensions III.</em></p>
<p>ININ Games later deleted its posts mentioning these smaller Switch 2 cartridges and issued a correction on its website and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">social media pages</a>. However, the publisher reiterated that <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> will be released on a physical cartridge, but that &quot;no further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,&quot; ININ Games said in a statement. &quot;Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.&quot;</p>
<p>If we&#39;re reading between the lines, ININ Games may have been early to tease a crucial detail about Switch 2 cartridges that Nintendo wasn&#39;t officially ready to reveal yet. For more context, Nintendo reportedly only offers physical game cartridges for Switch 2 with a 64GB capacity. With less demanding games like <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, that much storage capacity could be unnecessary and raise production costs. Nintendo still hasn&#39;t made an announcement about these potential smaller cartridges, but we could see a lot more game publishers opting for physical copies of their upcoming games if they are indeed an option.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/game-publisher-says-cheaper-switch-2-cartridges-are-coming-in-since-deleted-post-191145230.html?src=rss
