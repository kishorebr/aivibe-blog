<p>A Facebook feature that scans your phone&#39;s photo library to make AI collages and edits is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/new-facebook-feature-suggests-edits-and-collages-to-share/">now available</a> in North America. Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/facebook-test-uses-meta-ai-to-process-photos-youve-yet-to-upload-140021100.html">tested it</a> earlier this year. It&#39;s an opt-in feature, but the company may train its models on your media if you use its AI editing or share the results.</p>
<p>From a user experience perspective, the idea is to help you find &quot;hidden gems&quot; in your library and turn them into something shareable. After scanning your photo library (with your permission), it will cough up suggestions. For example, it might recommend a collage based on a vacation, a recap of a graduation party or simply spruce up some photos with AI. For better or worse, it&#39;s another step in the direction of automating creativity and skill.</p>

It lists privacy terms you agree to by clicking allow." data-uuid="90898894-2bd2-30ce-8318-a917e1faaa02"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Zooming out to Meta&#39;s business motives, it&#39;s easy to imagine this is a move for more AI training data. The company says it won&#39;t train its AI on your camera roll &quot;unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share.&quot; If you find it useful enough to use, your media may help train Meta&#39;s AI models.</p>
<p>The company says the feature&#39;s suggestions are private to you until you choose to share them. Its permissions state, &quot;To create ideas for you, we&#39;ll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location or themes.&quot; However, Meta says your media won&#39;t be used for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&#39;s opt-in, so you can safely ignore this altogether without privacy worries. If you grant it permission, you&#39;ll see its suggestions (visible only to you) in Stories and Feed. And should you activate it but change your mind later, you can turn it back off through Facebook&#39;s camera roll settings.</p>
<p>The feature is available now in the US and Canada. Meta says it will soon begin testing it in other countries.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/facebooks-latest-ai-feature-can-scan-your-phones-camera-roll-200056906.html?src=rss
