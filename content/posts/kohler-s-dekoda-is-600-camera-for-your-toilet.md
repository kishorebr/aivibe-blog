<p>Home products company Kohler is launching a new Kohler Health division, and its first product is a $599 camera for your toilet. The item, dubbed Dekoda, is equipped with sensors that analyze whatever liquid or solid waste goes into the toilet bowl with &quot;validated machine learning algorithms.&quot; The data, which can offer insights on hydration and gut health as well as detecting the presence of blood, then goes to Kohler Health&#39;s iPhone app, although Android support is in the works. It comes with a magnetic charging pad and a wall-mounted remote that can optionally use Bluetooth fingerprint authorization so that you don&#39;t learn way more than you want to about your guests.</p>
<p>I must salute the PR person who came up with this gem from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kohler-co-launches-kohler-health-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-health-and-wellness-in-the-home-302584350.html"><ins>release</ins></a>: &quot;By turning the bathroom into a connected, data-informed health and wellness hub, Kohler Health empowers individuals to turn ordinary routines into proactive, personalized experiences.&quot; Because who doesn&#39;t want to be proactive about pee? Health data is great, no arguments here. But this seems like a pretty extreme and expensive way to figure out if you&#39;re drinking enough water. Maybe I&#39;m in the minority with my skepticism, however, because this isn&#39;t the first instance we&#39;ve seen of toilet-bowl tech for better health. Withings introduced a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html"><ins>monitor</ins></a> a few years back for analyzing urine streams, which you can buy for a mere $500.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re just that passionate about tracking your biometrics, Dekoda products are expected to ship starting tomorrow. You&#39;ll also need to sign up for a Kohler Health subscription on top of the product cost, and there are individual and family plan options.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kohlers-dekoda-is-600-camera-for-your-toilet-225942144.html?src=rss
