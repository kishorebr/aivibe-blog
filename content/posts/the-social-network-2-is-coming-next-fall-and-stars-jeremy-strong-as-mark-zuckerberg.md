<p>The long-awaited sequel to <em>The Social Network</em> will hit theaters next fall, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/social-network-2-release-date-title-cast-1236557217/">according to a report by <em>Deadline</em></a>. The official release date is set for October 9, 2026, which is just about 16 years after the first film dropped.</p>
<p>We also have plenty of other information, including the full cast and the actual name of the movie. The official name is <em>The Social Reckoning</em>, which makes sense as the movie follows recent events in which Facebook got into legal and political trouble when a whistleblower alleged that the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://law.yale.edu/isp/events/facebook-files">knew the platform was harming society</a> but did nothing about it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The cast is being led by Jeremy Strong from <em>Succession</em>, who takes over Zuckerberg duties from actor Jesse Eisenberg. Mikey Madison is playing the aforementioned whistle blower Frances Haugen and <em>The Bear&#39;s</em> Jeremy Allen White portrays <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Jeff Horowitz.</p>
<p>Bill Burr is also appearing in this flick, though we don&#39;t know in what capacity. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-social-network-2-bill-burr-cast-1236385660/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> has suggested</a> he will play a fictional character invented for the film that will be an amalgamation of several people. Aaron Sorkin is both writing and directing this one. He wrote the first movie, but David Fincher directed it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-social-network-2-is-coming-next-fall-and-stars-jeremy-strong-as-mark-zuckerberg-191021848.html?src=rss
