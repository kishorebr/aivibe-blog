<p>The long-awaited cyberpunk platformer <em>Replaced</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889"><ins>just got hit with a short delay</ins></a>. The pixel-art game <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pixel-art-cyberpunk-game-replaced-arrives-in-march-170253220.html"><ins>was supposed to come out on March 12</ins></a>, but will now be released on April 14. That&#39;s just a month, which isn&#39;t that big of a deal considering this game has been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/replaced-game-xbox-windows-182032719.html"><ins>on our radar for five years</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Why the delay? Developer Sad Cat Studios notes that the game is &quot;technically finished&quot; but the team needs a few more weeks for polish. The company says it wants the day-one release to be &quot;polished, stable and true to the vision&quot; of the original concept. This is something to be commended, in my opinion, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/concords-disastrous-launch-reportedly-leads-to-its-directors-self-demotion-215515013.html"><ins>given the sad state</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-for-pc-is-a-buggy-mess-144036281.html"><ins>of many game launches</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html"><ins>in recent years</ins></a>.</p>

<p>This is just the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-again-this-time-until-spring-2026-182908044.html"><ins>latest delay for the game</ins></a>. However, previous delays have been for a very good reason. The development team had to relocate from Belarus to Cyprus after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p><em>Replaced</em> is an absolutely gorgeous-looking 2.5D platformer set in a dystopian alternative 1980s America. You play as an AI unwillingly trapped in a human body. There looks to be plenty of cinematic action, with a blurb promising a combination of &quot;precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>The game will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG and the Microsoft Store. It&#39;ll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-has-once-again-been-delayed-190621246.html?src=rss
