<p>Brazilian regulators have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.br/cade/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/cade-forma-maioria-pela-homologacao-de-tcc-em-investigacao-sobre-praticas-da-apple-no-ios"><ins>reached a settlement</ins></a> with Apple after a yearslong investigation into the company&#39;s App Store fee practices as well as its policies against third-party app stores. As first reported by Brazilian tech site <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/apple-ainda-podera-cobrar-taxas-no-brasil-veja-aliquotas/"><em><ins>tecnoblog</ins></em></a>, the nation&#39;s Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) said it has accepted Apple&#39;s proposed agreement that will address claims of anticompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The agreement will allow for third-party payment processing methods for in-app purchases and reins in Apple&#39;s anti-steering efforts by allowing links to external websites for transactions. The settlement requires that these payment options be shown next to Apple&#39;s own. Apple must also allow third-party app stores to be installed on its devices, though the company is allowed to display warnings to users if they are written in a neutral and objective way.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A new fee structure has also been agreed to, with Apple applying no fee if users are directed to outside payment methods in a text-only way. The use of a clickable link or button for an external payment option will incur a 15 percent fee. Purchases made within Apple&#39;s App Store will still be subject to a 10 percent or 20 percent commission. Developers using Apple’s payment system would also be subject to a 5 percent transaction fee.</p>
<p>Additionally a 5 percent &quot;Core Technology Fee&quot; would be levied against all app downloads from third-party app stores. This new structure bears similarities to policy and fee <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html"><ins>changes made</ins></a> after the EU passed its Digital Markets Act, with Apple allowing third-party app stores and external purchases subject to varying fees.</p>
<p>Apple will have 105 days to comply under the new agreement and could face fines of up to $27 million for failure to implement the changes. The iPhone maker has been facing mounting pressure from regulators worldwide over its anti-steering practices and was recently handed a $587 million fine by the EU for violating its Digital Markets Act.
