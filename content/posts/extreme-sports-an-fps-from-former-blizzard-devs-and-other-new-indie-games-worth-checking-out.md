<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. There have been quite a few high-profile arrivals this week, as well as others that have left early access and or arrived on more platforms.</p>
<p>I have a long flight this weekend and I&#39;m a little torn over what to play while I&#39;m in the air. I have my Switch 2, Steam Deck and Playdate with me (excessive, I know). As such, there are many ways I can go here. I haven&#39;t yet burrowed my way into <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, so that&#39;s a strong option. But then there are all the Playdate Season Two games I&#39;ve yet to check out — <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-taria--como-and-black-hole-havoc-210042109.html"><em>Taria &amp; Como</em></a> is one I definitely want to play — while my Steam Deck is bursting with games and is running out of storage space.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Decision paralysis is an all-too-common affliction these days, particularly when it comes to games or picking something to watch. I feel like the smartest choice here is to play whatever is taking up the most space on my Steam Deck that I&#39;ve yet to play, so I can just scrub it if I&#39;m not interested. I&#39;ll probably do that unless I do my usual thing while flying: try to catch up on sleep.</p>

<p>If there were a hall of fame just for mobile games, the first two Monument Valley games would surely be first-ballot inductees. While the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/monument-valley-3-breaks-the-series-old-boundaries-by-adding-a-sailboat-013638578.html">third entry in the series</a> perhaps didn&#39;t quite hit those heady heights, it still has its fans and was well-received when it debuted on iOS and Android via Netflix late last year. Just over seven months later, <em>Monument Valley 3</em> has <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/monument-valley-3-breaks-free-from-netflix-on-july-22-170002131.html">sailed onto more platforms</a>. Ustwo Games&#39; thoughtful and stylish M.C. Escher-inspired puzzler is now available on <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3132930/Monument_Valley_3/">PC</a>, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>RageSquid and publisher No More Robots had a surprise in store this week when they suddenly released <em>Descenders Next </em>during a showcase of that game and its downhill biking-focused predecessor. This is a multiplayer action sports game that, at the outset, features snowboarding and mountainboarding. The developers plan to add more extreme sports over time (the game is currently in early access and there&#39;s a two-year roadmap to the 1.0 release). <em>Descenders Next </em>is available on <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a>, Xbox and Game Pass for Xbox and PC.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html"><em>Wheel World</em></a> seems much more relaxing than <em>Descenders Next</em>, even though your mission is to save the world from complete collapse. The launch trailer for this open-world cycling game from Messhof (<em>Nidhogg</em>) has impeccable vibes. Between races, you&#39;ll be able to search for parts to upgrade your bike. Given its stellar track record, any game that Annapurna Interactive publishes is worth checking out, and I&#39;ll certainly be giving <em>Wheel World</em> a spin. It&#39;s out now on <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/">Steam</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wheel-world-1668c7">Epic Games Store</a>, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p><em>Wildgate</em> is a multiplayer shooter from publisher Dreamhaven&#39;s Moonshot Games division. Dreamhaven CEO Mike Morhaime is a co-founder and former president of Blizzard. Almost all of the company&#39;s first wave of employees used to work at Blizzard too. So it&#39;s maybe not too much of a surprise that <em>Wildgate</em> has a polished, colorful look. The team extraction shooter — which is now available on <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate/">Steam</a>, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S — has spaceship-based combat and a procedurally-generated map to help switch things up from game-to-game.</p>
<p>Dreamhaven has had quite a busy 2025 so far. It has released the full version of the enjoyable action RPG <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em> (by FuzzyBot Games), forged a publishing partnership with Game River for its tactical wargame <em>Mechabellum</em> and unleashed two games of its own in the shape of tabletop RPG party game <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dreamhavens-tabletop-rpg-party-game-sunderfolk-arrives-on-april-23-183006473.html"><em>Sunderfolk</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and now <em>Wildgate</em>.</p>

<p><em>Supervive</em> (previously known as <em>Project Loki</em>) is a game <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/project-loki-looks-like-a-rad-mix-of-league-of-legends-and-fortnite-130053005.html">we&#39;ve had an eye on for a while</a> and it&#39;s now out of early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/">Steam</a>. Theorycraft has overhauled this free-to-play MOBA/battle royale hybrid with the 1.0 update by introducing a larger map that has more traversal options, a two-seater aerial vehicle, more playable characters, faster revives, an upgraded user interface <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1283700/announcements/detail/516342322187730946">and much more</a>.</p>

<p><em>Agefield High: Rock the School</em> is a narrative adventure game that follows a high school senior after his parents move with him to a new town. Sam Tatum wants to make his last few months of school unforgettable, and if he feels the need to skip class or mow lawns for a few bucks to make that happen, so be it.</p>
<p>This project from Refugium Games, which is in development for PC and consoles and slated to debut in early 2026, already feels like it&#39;s dripping with nostalgia, and that&#39;s just based on the trailer and press release. It&#39;s set in 2002 and is said to have a soundtrack filled with pop-punk tunes. <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/"><em>Agefield High: Rock the School</em></a> has a branching narrative too, with several endings to experience. The developers took some inspiration from Rockstar&#39;s <em>Bully</em> and since <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bully.fandom.com/wiki/Bully_2">we might not ever get a proper sequel</a> to that game, <em>Agefield High: Rock the School</em> may just fill a certain void in my millennial heart.</p>

<p>I quite like the aesthetic of <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052510/Oceaneers/"><em>Oceaneers</em></a>, a survival-crafting sim from Barrel Smash Studios. It seems to draw from the same well as <em>Don&#39;t Starve</em>, but that&#39;s hardly a bad thing. You&#39;ll hop between islands in search of resources and ways to expand your colony. You&#39;ll also battle sharks and crabs, and maybe even discover hidden bunkers — perhaps there&#39;s someone inside who has to <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pushing_the_button">punch a sequence into a terminal every 108 minutes</a>? <em>Oceaneers</em> is expected to hit Steam early access in 2026 with a demo dropping soon. Maybe I&#39;ll start a long-overdue <em>Lost</em> rewatch in the meantime.</p>

<p>Getting lost in a fictional world for dozens upon dozens of hours can be quite appealing, and I do enjoy larger games in that vein. But so many games are too bloated these days and I do love shorter, more focused experiences. <em>Catto&#39;s Post Office</em> is said to take around an hour to complete.</p>
<p>In this open-world title from In Shambles Studio and publisher Cult Games, you&#39;ll play as a Postcat who delivers packages to the residents of a small town. You can do cat things like hide in boxes, knock stuff over and meow whenever you like with a dedicated button. It looks too dang adorable. <em>Catto&#39;s Post Office</em> will cost $5 when it <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2908050/Cattos_Post_Office/">hits Steam</a> on August 4, and there will be a 20 percent launch discount.</p>

<p>You know how, in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, Cloud has a massive sword? Well, what if you could have a weapon like that in a puzzle-focused action platformer? Enter the wonderfully titled Gigasword from solo developer Studio Hybrid and publisher Akupara Games. Along with using your weapon to take out unfortunate baddies and beastly bosses, you&#39;ll employ it to solve puzzles and help with platforming. <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885930/GIGASWORD/"><em>Gigasword</em></a> is coming to Steam on October 2, and there&#39;s a demo available now.</p>
<div id="ef113a4b445d4511ab17a15381eb8df3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PGQepNNzoG0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Speaking of games with fantastic names, <em>The Player Who Can&#39;t Level Up</em> sure has one of those. This is an action roguelite that is based on <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://manhuaplus.org/manga/player-who-can-t-level-up">a webtoon</a> that debuted last year. It has a slick, gorgeous trailer and — as the title suggests — you won&#39;t be able to level up your character. You can, however, select perks to help you hunt monsters. Tripearl Games is the studio behind the project, for which it&#39;s targeting a 2026 debut on <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2985520/The_Player_Who_Cant_Level_Up/">PC</a> and consoles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/extreme-sports-an-fps-from-former-blizzard-devs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110007013.html?src=rss
