<p>Less than a month after Capcom’s surprise announcement of the next <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-demo-first--and-third-person-views-sgf-2025-150009510.html"><ins>Resident Evil</ins></a>  game, another new entry has been confirmed. But before Resi fans get too wild with excitement, this one is a mobile spin-off for iOS and Android called <em>Resident Evil Survival Unit</em>. It’s a strategy game that somehow fits into the broader universe, even if it’s not clear how at this point.</p>
<p>We don’t have a lot of concrete information at the moment, with the game set to be fully revealed in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.residentevil-survivalunit.com/en"><ins>showcase</ins></a> scheduled July 10 at 6pm ET, but we do know that it’s being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Korean developer Joycity. The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://corp.joycity.com/ko/main"><ins>latter</ins></a> is currently working on another strategy game called <em>Disney Realm Breakers</em>, with access to various Disney IP including <em>Toy Story </em>and <em>The Incredibles</em>. Joycity is also the studio behind <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War</em>, a free-to-play real-time strategy game that has an average rating of 4.4 from 210 thousand <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5d6e8859-5e52-4fb5-8ee7-8bdeeb70baac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=reviews&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmpveWNpdHkucG90YyZobD1lbl9HQiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWQ2ZTg4NTktNWU1Mi00ZmI1LThlZTctOGJkZWViNzBiYWFjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmpveWNpdHkucG90YyZobD1lbl9HQiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe1no6OdE55MtD5rFQJVdefGUjR9fJUjERlvE0c99i37&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.joycity.potc%26hl%3Den_GB" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joycity.potc&amp;hl=en_GB"><ins>reviews</ins></a> on the Google Play Store.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Strategy is clearly the studio’s favored genre, then, and in its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://corp.joycity.com/ko/main"><ins>announcement message</ins></a> for <em>Resident Evil Survival Unit </em>it promises the game "expands the global fanbase of <em>Resident Evil </em>to mobile, allowing players to enjoy the world of the series with a new approach that is different from the existing series." It was also confirmed in a press release that the mobile game is being developed in close collaboration to "ensure authenticity and quality."</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>(the official name for what is technically <em>Resident Evil 9</em>) was announced back in June at SGF 25, and centers on a new character called Grace Ashcroft. For the first time in the series’ history, both first-person and third-person gameplay perspectives will be an option from launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-is-getting-a-new-mobile-spin-off-game-160044931.html?src=rss
