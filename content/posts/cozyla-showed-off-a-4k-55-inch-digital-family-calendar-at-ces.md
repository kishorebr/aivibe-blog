<p>New tech at CES often makes categorization hard. Is Cozyla’s latest device a digital family calendar, a TV or a smart home hub? After seeing it, I’d say the answer is, yes? Cozyla calls the Calendar + Max the “largest interactive hub in it’s category.” And indeed, it’s the size of a big flatscreen, but the main interface is just like any other Cozyla device, an Android-based family calendar and planner with shared schedules, notes, meal plans, and chores. It syncs with Google, Yahoo and Apple calendars as well as Outlook, and it will run apps from the Google Play store. (Yahoo owns Engadget, but has no say in our editorial coverage.)</p>
<p>But this super-sized version can also stream shows and movies with whichever apps you subscribe to. The photo integration, via the app, will take pics from your phone and stick them on the bigs screen. You can also create a slideshow and photo walls to look at when the calendar is off. </p>
<p>The smart home integration lets you view your security camera and video doorbell feeds on a much larger scale than your phone’s display can offer. The display has a camera of its own so you can make FaceTime and Zoom calls. </p>
<p>The Max comes on a built-in stand that you can roll around the house, along with a battery that should power the whole thing for around six hours. When I first heard about it, I found myself wondering where I would put Calendar+ Max in my house. The kitchen is an ideal centralized calendar location, but I don’t want to watch <em>Miss Scarlet</em> in there. Luckily, the wheels make that conundrum moot. This can go anywhere you want it to, and swings into portrailt orientation that looks great for chore mode, and landscape orientation for watching shows. </p>
<p>Possibly the best part is the lack of subscription required. Like with all Cozyla screens, there’s no ongoing cost to use all the features. The Calendar + Max has no release date or price available just yet, but if I ever decided to organize my family’s life beyond barely contained chaos, I can see myself considering it. </p>
