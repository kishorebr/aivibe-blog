<p>As part of a new test, Meta will let anyone rate a Community Note or request one for a post, Meta&#39;s Chief Information Security Officer Guy Rosen <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/guyro/status/1965800300557857053"><ins>shared on X</ins></a>. After <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-entering-its-post-truth-era-on-monday-202858791.html"><ins>testing the feature</ins></a> in March, the company formally introduced Community Notes <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-entering-its-post-truth-era-on-monday-202858791.html"><ins>as a replacement</ins></a> for its fact-checking program in April of this year.</p>
<p>You <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/you-can-now-sign-up-to-be-a-contributor-to-metas-community-notes-feature-190814234.html"><ins>have to apply</ins></a> to actually write Community Notes, but Meta&#39;s new test means that anyone who sees one can rate it to signal whether it&#39;s helpful or not. They&#39;ll also be able to request a note if a post is incorrect or needs additional context. Based on the screenshot Rosen shared, Meta&#39;s rating system is a simple thumbs up or down, but the fact the company is opening the system up to more input at all is one sign of its continued expansion.</p>

<p>The test also includes a new system for notifying users if they interact with a post that receives a Community Note. Meta did something similar with posts that were fact-checked in the past, so this seems like a good way to let people know if they&#39;ve read something misleading. Don&#39;t expect to be receiving those notifications too often just yet, though. Rosen says that while there are over 70,000 people writing Community Notes and over 15,000 notes have actually been written, only six percent have been published. Meta is still very early in this whole process.</p>
<p>Community Notes are just one component of a larger <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-right-wing-reinvention-also-includes-an-end-to-dei-programs-and-trans-messenger-themes-204031848.html"><ins>right-wing</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-will-weigh-in-on-metas-new-hate-speech-policies-174044682.html"><ins>turn</ins></a> Meta has taken in the wake of Trump&#39;s reelection. While the system has been styled as pro-free speech, it doesn&#39;t necessarily offer the same ability to counter misinformation that fact-checking does. For example, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-community-notes-feature-has-one-job-and-its-failing-to-do-it-202645987.html"><ins>multiple reports</ins></a> found that X&#39;s Community Notes program did little to address the platform&#39;s misinformation problem.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-tests-letting-anyone-rate-community-notes-201208279.html?src=rss
