<p>We're nearly five years out from the release of the original <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-5-console-accessories-pre-order-guide-181500425.html">PlayStation 5</a> and rumors of Sony's next-gen console are starting to bubble up to the surface. In a YouTube video from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tym6xxCKvHg">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, the leaker shares extensive information about the PlayStation 6's possible specs, starting price and release timing. It's always important to take these early leaks with a large grain of salt and Moore's Law is Dead even adds a disclaimer in the video that the info was sourced from a leaked AMD presentation to Sony back in 2023, adding that some of these specs may have changed by now.</p>

<p>While Sony hasn't confirmed anything, the leaks show the company may be prioritizing lower power output and keeping costs in line with previous generations for the upcoming PS6. The video claims the next-gen console will have three times the rasterization, or 3D rendering, performance compared to the base PS5 and roughly two times what's offered by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-ps5-pro-is-available-to-pre-order-today-115549437.html">PS5 Pro</a>. The YouTuber explained that the PS6 is rumored to have PS4 and PS5 backwards compatibility, while potentially releasing with a price tag of $499. That price point could be an indication that Sony wants to tap into the same success the PS4 had, which was partly thanks to its lower price compared to the competition at the time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with the PS6, Sony is reportedly also working on a handheld that will complement the console. According to the leaked info, the PS6 handheld will get a microSD slot, an M.2 SSD slot, a touchscreen, haptic vibration and dual mics. The PS6 handheld rumors detail specs that should beat out the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-will-be-released-during-the-2025-holiday-season-142135533.html">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and a USB-C port that could offer video out capabilities. According to the leak, the PS6 handheld could have a price range between $400 and $500. For the PS6 and the PS6 handheld, the leaker claims that Sony will start manufacturing both in mid-2027, with a potential release date window between fall 2027 and early 2028.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/leak-claims-the-ps6-could-have-triple-the-performance-as-the-ps5-for-the-same-price-203801615.html?src=rss
