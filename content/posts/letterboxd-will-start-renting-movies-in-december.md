<p>Letterboxd&#39;s foray into digital video rentals officially launches in December, the social film platform shared in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/letterboxd-video-store/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a new blog post</a>. Plans for a “Letterboxd Video Store” were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/letterboxd-will-launch-a-curated-online-rental-service-for-films-145056220.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">first announced</a> in March, but now Letterboxd has started to fill in some of the details of what kinds of movies its store will carry and where they&#39;ll be available to watch.</p><p>The collection of films available through the Letterboxd Video Store will be curated around a few categories, according to the company. Those include films featured at film festivals that currently don&#39;t have distribution, titles that continue to hang around in users&#39; watchlists, film restorations and &quot;limited-time drops of sneak peeks and unreleased gems.&quot; Letterboxd compared the process of narrowing down what films to try and offer like the &quot;employee picks&quot; shelf you might see at a local video store, only every Letterboxd user is an employee.</p><p>Films rented through Letterboxd will be available to watch on the web, iOS, Android, Apple TV and Android TV, and can be streamed to screens that support Chromecast and AirPlay. Letterboxd hasn&#39;t shared what its rental terms or prices will be, but did note that rental availability and cost will vary depending on your location. The company also warns that some films will only be available for a limited amount of time.</p><p>As an expansion on its core competencies of tracking what films you and your friends have watched and letting you review them, video rentals seem like a natural addition for Letterboxd. It&#39;s a bit like Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-28-amazon-acquires-goodreads-kindle-recommendation-engine.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">acquired</a> the book reviewing platform Goodreads in 2013, after establishing itself as a physical and digital bookseller. Letterboxd has defined itself as a trusted film reviewing platform, and now it&#39;s branching out into selling films. In the same way Goodreads can funnel readers back towards Amazon, Letterboxd can use movie fans to surface the best films to rent and keep them from heading somewhere else to watch them.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/letterboxd-will-start-renting-movies-in-december-214900026.html?src=rss
