People Inc., one of the largest media publishers in the U.S., has signed an AI licensing deal with Microsoft. The media giant (formerly known as Dotdash Meredith) made the announcement Tuesday as a part of parent company IAC’s third-quarter earnings. 

Under the deal, People Inc. will become a launch partner in Microsoft’s publisher content marketplace. This is the company’s second AI deal following its earlier agreement with OpenAI last year.


	
	




	
	



People Inc. CEO Neil Vogel described the new marketplace as “essentially a pay-per-use market where AI players directly can compensate publishers for use of their content on, sort of like an ‘a la carte’ basis.”

“It’s a very strong endorsement of us to be in the room with them and a very strong endorsement of the publishing marketplace and the value of content to make AI that is of high value,” Vogel said. 

The announcement of the Microsoft deal was shared during IAC’s earnings, alongside the news that Google Search’s AI Overviews has been hurting the publisher’s traffic. For the first time, People Inc. shared data with investors that showed how Google Search, which accounted for 54% of its traffic two years ago, had dropped to 24% of its traffic during the past quarter.

The agreement differs from the OpenAI deal, which Vogel characterized as more of an “all-you-can-eat” model, but said People Inc. was happy with either model. What matters to the company is that its work is “respected and paid for,” he said. The company didn’t share the specific deal terms, though. 

People Inc. has taken issue with the way AI companies have ingested media without paying to fuel their AI products and train their models. Recently, Vogel criticized Google, calling the tech giant a “bad actor” because it uses the same bot to crawl websites for its Google
