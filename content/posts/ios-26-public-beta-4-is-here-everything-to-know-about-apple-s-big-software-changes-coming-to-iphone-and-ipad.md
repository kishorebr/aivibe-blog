<p>In just few weeks, Apple's annual <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html">iPhone event</a> will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-heres-what-to-know-ahead-of-apples-fall-event-153024327.html">iPhone 17 lineup</a>. In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/ios-26-is-official-apple-changes-from-version-numbers-to-years-for-its-os-names-172129166.html">iOS 26</a>. Until that happens, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html">download and install</a> the newly released public beta 4 (or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">iOS 26 developer beta 7</a> for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">taking screenshots</a> is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Liquid Glass</a>, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html">macOS</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>
<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point "<a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">in the coming year</a>," so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>
<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-ios-26">What is iOS 26?</h2>
<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html">restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring</a> functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-dropped-a-security-update-for-all-its-platforms-194528494.html">Apple released 18.6.2</a> to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated "26" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a "<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">new translucent material</a>" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>
<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>
<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26">New changes coming to iPadOS 26</h2>
<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>
<p>Check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-airpods">What about AirPods?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this "studio-quality" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-which-iphones-will-be-able-to-upgrade-to-ios-26">Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?</h2>
<p>A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html">eligible for the iOS 26 update</a>.</p>
