<p>EA&#39;s beleaguered online shooter <em>Anthem</em> is shutting down for good <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update"><ins>on January 12, 2026</ins></a>. The game will be removed from the company&#39;s storefront ahead of that on August 15. It&#39;ll be available for download after that date so long as it&#39;s already in your library.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the game have already begun winding down. Players can no longer purchase premium in-game currency as of today, though they can still use existing balances to buy stuff. <em>Anthem</em> is a game that can only be played online, so once the servers shut down in January it will be bricked.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="68bddb81f02b4b3393ac955f6500b88b"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPf-EATqFng?si=yOHRzLM8Lroy10oM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The game launched in 2019 to poor reviews that called out the reliance on grinding and an overall lack of polish. This wasn&#39;t helped by a number of bugs <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-19-bioware-anthem-fixes-still-coming.html"><ins>that plagued early builds</ins></a>. Developer BioWare promised fixes, but those <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-04-anthem-crunch-bioware-ea-game-development.html"><ins>took a while to get implemented</ins></a>.</p>
<p>By then, the damage to the brand was too severe. BioWare <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect"><ins>ceased active development</ins></a> of <em>Anthem</em> in 2021, which was followed by the game&#39;s director <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-game-director-jonathan-warner-departs-bioware-after-nearly-10-years"><ins>leaving the company</ins></a>. In other words, we all kind of knew this shutdown was coming.</p>
<p>EA says that no layoffs occurred at the company as a result of this decision. However, that&#39;s likely because BioWare has already been through several steep staffing cuts. EA <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bioware-cuts-around-50-jobs-to-become-a-more-agile-and-focused-studio-211513365.html"><ins>laid off 50 BioWare employees</ins></a> in 2023. This was followed by <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss"><ins>even more layoffs</ins></a> after <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> underperformed.</p>
<p>BioWare currently has an operating staff of less than 100 people. The company is currently focused on the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/ea-is-restructuring-bioware-to-focus-on-mass-effect-5.1680189/"><ins>development of </ins><em><ins>Mass Effect 5</ins></em></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/anthem-is-officially-shutting-down-on-january-12-185236926.html?src=rss
