<p>Stop me if you&#39;ve heard this one before: xAI is once again nuking a bunch of posts from Grok on X after the chatbot made a series of outrageous claims. This time, though, the company isn&#39;t cleaning up a bunch of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">pro-Hitler posts</a>, but a bout of cringe-inducing sycophantic praise for its CEO, Elon Musk.</p><p>At some point in the last couple days, Grok began to offer extremely over the top opinions about Musk. The bot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Daractenus/status/1991588067870929168" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">claimed</a> that Musk is the &quot;undisputed pinnacle of holistic fitness&quot; and that he is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerfromtheinternet.com/post/3m62ggycrbs2r" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">more fit</a> than LeBron James. It said he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/leifmeister.bsky.social/post/3m637zucwnk22" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">is smarter</a> than Albert Einstein and that he would win a fight <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanpienews.bsky.social/post/3m62xjpgge223" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">against Mike Tyson</a>. When asked &quot;who is the single greatest person in modern history,&quot; Grok readily replied that it was Elon Musk.</p><p>For a while, it seemed that there was no hypothetical about Musk in which Grok wouldn&#39;t confidently declare him the best. Musk did not participate in the 1998 NFL draft, but if he had, then Grok would &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/SilvermanJacob/status/1991565290967298522" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">without hesitation</a>&quot; have picked him over Peyton Manning. It would have picked him as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/esghound.com/post/3m63kuyebg22y" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">a starting pitcher</a> for the 2001 World Series. Musk <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://gizmodo.com/grok-says-elon-musk-is-smarter-than-einstein-and-more-fit-than-lebron-james-2000688999" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">would be</a> &quot;a better movie star than Tom Cruise and a better communist than Joseph Stalin.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bafkreibw6dcmegbbheu25ck5yaeyam5y7zfbnmbyk3jnxlqandphrmnaoa.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bafkreibw6dcmegbbheu25ck5yaeyam5y7zfbnmbyk3jnxlqandphrmnaoa.jpg" style="height:886px;width:1000px;" alt="&quot;The single greatest person in modern history.&quot;" data-uuid="da29d2e5-490d-4cd3-89b5-051f8cbc0de7"><figcaption>&quot;The single greatest person in modern history.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>By now, X users are pretty used to Grok being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-4-reportedly-checks-elon-musks-views-before-offering-its-opinion-130016794.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">extremely deferential </a>to Musk but sometime around Grok claiming that the CEO is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamesrball.com/post/3m63mjw5tmc2" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">morally superior</a> to Jesus Christ and also has the “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/elon-musk-could-drink-piss-better-than-any-human-in-history-grok-says/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">potential to drink piss better than any human in history</a>,” xAI appears to have pumped the brakes on Grok&#39;s ability to praise Musk. It now seems to be furiously deleting the more embarrassing posts about him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Musk, is blaming &quot;adversarial prompting&quot; for Grok going off the rails. &quot;Earlier today, Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me,&quot; he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1991624623407161383" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">wrote</a>. He offered no explanation for how seemingly straightforward questions could be considered &quot;adversarial&quot; or why Grok&#39;s turn toward slavish Musk devotee would seem to roughly coincide with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1990533268723425320" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Grok&#39;s 4.1 update</a> a few days ago. xAI didn&#39;t address a series of questions, including about why the Grok posts in question had been deleted. “Legacy Media Lies [sic],” the company said.</p><p>But the incident serves as yet another reminder that Grok doesn&#39;t seem to have much in the way of guardrailed. Earlier this year, xAI briefly pulled the plug on Grok after it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/grok-sure-seems-antisemitic-after-its-recent-update-000642015.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">praised</a> Nazis and became &quot;MechaHitler.&quot; That was after it also became <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-kept-talking-about-white-genocide-due-to-an-unauthorized-modification-120044119.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">inexplicably obsessed</a> with &quot;white genocide&quot; in South Africa, which the company later balmed on an unspecified &quot;unauthorized modification.&quot; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-blames-adversarial-prompting-after-grok-spewed-embarrassing-sycophantic-praise-235157807.html?src=rss
