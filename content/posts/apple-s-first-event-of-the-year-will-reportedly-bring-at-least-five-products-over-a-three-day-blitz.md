<p>Ready your wallets if you&#39;ve been thinking about upgrading your Apple products. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple will announce &quot;at least five products,&quot; starting on Monday, March 2, and extending to its scheduled &quot;experience&quot; on Wednesday, March 4.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a long list of potential options that Apple could announce next month, but Gurman is confident in a few. According to the report, Apple is &quot;very likely&quot; to reveal the low-cost MacBook, especially considering the event logo&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-may-be-adding-a-splash-of-color-to-its-upcoming-budget-friendly-macbook-192740002.html">choice of colors</a> that could reference the new laptop colors. Gurman also predicted that Apple could announce the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17e-will-reportedly-bring-some-key-upgrades-without-raising-the-price-174154577.html">iPhone 17e</a>, since its predecessor was launched last spring, and an iPad Air that&#39;s updated with the M4 chip. Previous rumors point to Apple getting ready to drop the upgraded MacBook Pro, which will likely get M5 Pro and Max chips, and the new MacBook Air with the base M5 chip. If that wasn&#39;t enough, Apple could even debut the refreshed <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-mac-studio-m4-max-review-a-creative-powerhouse-123000265.html">Mac Studio</a> and a new Apple Studio Display since the two desktop-oriented options were already expected to be released in the first half of the year.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There hasn&#39;t been any confirmation from Apple directly, but it may have left behind some hints for this &quot;three-day blitz&quot; of product announcements. Going off Apple&#39;s wording, the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/heres-what-to-expect-at-apples-product-launch-event-on-march-4-173612772.html">March 4 event</a> will be an &quot;Apple Experience&quot; with locations in New York, London and Shanghai, which doesn&#39;t sound like the typical format of an event with keynote addresses that&#39;s paired with a livestream. Gurman also noted that Apple usually announces its new products on Tuesday, unlike the official Wednesday timing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-first-event-of-the-year-will-reportedly-bring-at-least-five-products-over-a-three-day-blitz-175017716.html?src=rss
