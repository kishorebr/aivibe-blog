We've seen similar offers pop up in the past, but considering Audible is one of the top audiobook streaming services out there, it's worth highlighting again. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b4d2d113-6f90-4134-bfa3-ab46f0bb9fb6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=New+Audible+subscribers&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAeAxGICc7O_JBx3r1zQPvOJ8Ryko5RcIdG8UOhNl3x0e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudible-Books-and-Originals%2Fb%3Fnode%3D18145289011" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011">New Audible subscribers</a> can get three months of access to the Premium Plus plan for $3. That's a total of $42 off for the whole three-month period.</p> 
<p>This is one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">best streaming deals</a> around right now. The offer runs through July 31, which is actually a few weeks after Prime Day 2025 ends. Just keep in mind that if you don't cancel your Audible membership before the promotional period ends, it will automatically renew at the standard $15-per-month price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Through the Audible Premium Plus plan, you'll receive one credit each month. You can use this to claim any audiobook you like on the platform, whether it's a bestseller, new release or something else you've been meaning to get to. You'll retain access to audiobooks you claim with credits even after your subscription expires. So, you're effectively getting three audiobooks for your permanent collection for three bucks.</p> 
<p>Audible members will be able to take advantage of exclusive discounts and sales too. They also get access to thousands of audiobooks, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-07-audible-free-original-audiobooks.html">Audible Originals</a> and podcasts as long as their subscription remains active.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/audible-prime-day-deal-get-three-months-of-access-for-only-3-143734099.html?src=rss
