<p>Links have proven to be a tricky thing when it comes to social media engagement. On platforms like Threads, data suggests that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-users-still-barely-click-links-170139103.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">people often don&#39;t click the links</a> in posts, and creators on X have complained that posts including links don&#39;t get as much visibility. X is now trying to solve that. Head of product Nikita Bier <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1979994223224209709" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shared</a> that the platform is &quot;testing a new link experience&quot; that lets people open a link without leaving the original post entirely, so they can still view the Like, Repost and other buttons. The test is rolling out to iOS users first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re testing a new link experience, starting on iOS -- to make it easier for your followers to engage with your post while browsing links.<br><br>For creators, a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower reach.

</div><p>&quot;To help get better signal, posts will now collapse to the bottom of the page so people can react while you&#39;re reading,&quot; Bier wrote alongside a screen recording of how it will work. As to why posts with links typically don&#39;t perform as well, Bier said, &quot;This is because the web browser covers the post and people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn&#39;t get a clear signal whether the content is any good.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, X has been accused of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-slowing-down-links-to-websites-elon-musk-has-publicly-feuded-with-185544463.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">throttling links to</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-temporarily-blocked-users-from-sharing-links-to-signal-170642960.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">specific sites</a>, and Elon Musk has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">said</a> in the past that links &quot;don&#39;t get as much attention&quot; on the platform, so tweaking the popups will only go so far in addressing the reach issue. Bier added that posts should always &quot;stand alone as great content so write a solid caption.&quot;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-is-testing-a-new-way-of-opening-links-in-posts-to-improve-engagement-211210520.html?src=rss
