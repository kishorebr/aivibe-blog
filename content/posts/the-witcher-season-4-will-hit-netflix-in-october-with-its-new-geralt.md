<p>It&#39;s been quite the wait, but the fourth season of <em>The Witcher</em> is almost here. In a teaser shared this weekend, Netflix finally revealed the release date: October 30. The video also provided an extended look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia â€” a casting change that fans naturally have <em>a lot</em> of feelings about after Henry Cavill won their hearts with his take on the character in the first three seasons. The minute-and-a-half-long clip doesn&#39;t give away too much about season four, but we now have a proper sense of what our new Geralt looks and sounds like.</p>
<p>This season will also see Laurence Fishburne join as Regis, Sharlto Copley as Leo Bonhart and James Purefoy as Skellen.
