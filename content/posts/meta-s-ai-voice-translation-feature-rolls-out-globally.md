<p>On Tuesday, Meta <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://creators.facebook.com/blog/meta-ai-translations">rolled out</a> its new voice dubbing feature globally. The Reels feature uses generative AI to translate your voice, with optional lip-syncing. Mark Zuckerberg first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-will-use-ai-to-create-lip-synced-translations-of-creators-reels-175949373.html">previewed the feature</a> at Meta Connect 2024.</p>
<p>At launch, the translations are only available for English to Spanish (and vice versa). The company says more languages will arrive later. At least at first, it&#39;s restricted to Facebook creators with 1,000+ followers. However, anyone with a public Instagram account can use it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool trains on your original voice and generates a translated audio track to match your tone. The lip-syncing add-on then matches your mouth&#39;s movements to the translated speech. The demo <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBPf8w7_89A">clip</a> the company showed last year was spot-on â€” eerily so.</p>

<p>To use the feature, choose the &quot;Translate your voice with Meta AI&quot; option before publishing a reel. That&#39;s also where you can choose to add lip syncing. There&#39;s an option to review the AI-translated version before publishing. Viewers will see a pop-up noting that it&#39;s an AI translation.</p>
<p>Meta says the feature works best for face-to-camera videos. The company recommends avoiding covering your mouth or including excessive background music. It works for up to two speakers, but it&#39;s best to avoid overlapping your speech.</p>
<p>The company frames the feature as a way for creators to expand their audiences beyond their native tongues. As such, it included a by-language performance tracker, so you can see how well it&#39;s doing in each language.</p>
