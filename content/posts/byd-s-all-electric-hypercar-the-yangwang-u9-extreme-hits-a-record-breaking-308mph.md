<p>A new hypercar has dethroned <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-bugattis-300-mph-run-tech.html">Bugatti&#39;s record</a> for the fastest production car, and unsurprisingly, it&#39;s an electric vehicle. During a livestream at the Automotive Testing Papenburg testing site in Germany, the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Ojlq7yxXw">YangWang U9 Extreme</a> hit a facemelting top speed of 496.22 kmph, or around 308.33 mph. That metric edges out the previous record from the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, which achieved 304.77 mph in 2019.</p>
<div id="e6d77ce47b87416aaffc9b17c68a50d2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGisz5gLShg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Officially, the fastest production car record is factored from the average of runs in both directions, whereas the U9 Extreme only reached its 308 mph top speed one way. That&#39;s not to minimize <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGisz5gLShg">this achievement</a>, whose pivotal moment from the livestream was highlighted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://carnewschina.com/2025/09/20/byd-unveiled-the-yangwang-u9-xtreme-achieving-496-22-km-h-a-nurburgring-lap-of-659-157byd-unveils-the-yangwang-u9-xtreme-achieving-496-22-km-h-a-nurburgring-lap-of-659-157/"><em>CarNewsChina</em></a><em>,</em> since Bugatti&#39;s record was also a one-way run. Although it&#39;s not surprising that the U9 Extreme was able to push these limits since it&#39;s packed with four motors that produce just under 3,000 horsepower. The electric hypercar also runs on one of the world&#39;s first 1,200V platforms, which offers better performance and efficiency, along with some weight reduction.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the Chiron Super Sport 300+, the U9 Extreme is going to be extremely limited with production capping at 30 units. There&#39;s no price yet, but looking at those specs, this EV will likely have a high cost to match. However, with this latest achievement, the YangWang U9 Extreme shouldn&#39;t have any trouble selling out quickly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/byds-all-electric-hypercar-the-yangwang-u9-extreme-hits-a-record-breaking-308mph-180727354.html?src=rss
