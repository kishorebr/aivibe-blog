Travel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an “AI Mode” feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the company’s website.

The feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayak’s integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results. 


	
	




	
	



The rollout follows the company’s April launch of Kayak.ai, built as a testing ground for working with AI technology. That site also combined Kayak’s data and tools with OpenAI’s technology, letting its tech team try out AI features ahead of bringing them over to Kayak.com

Essentially, the AI Mode feature offers the same functionality as the Kayak.ai website but is now built directly into Kayak’s website. The company suggests users could ask the chatbot for travel ideas, like locations to fly to for under a certain price point, the best deals to a preferred destination, comparing hotel amenities, finding nonstop flights and rental car options, and more.

Plus, users can ask the AI more open-ended questions, like “I want to party for NYE — where should I go?” to get recommendations without having specific destinations in mind. Or they could learn when the best time to fly somewhere would be, based on ticket prices. (Kayak has shared other AI prompt ideas on its own blog.)

The feature could be useful in helping consumers in the earlier stages of travel planning, when they’re just exploring ideas. However, it remains to be seen if AI users readily convert to paying customers using these methods. 

AI Mode is initially available in English in the United States but will expand to other countries and languages later in the month. The company also plans to roll out the feature to more platforms and add support for voice-based requests “soon.”
