<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamedevsofcolor.org/">Game Devs of Color Expo</a> is returning for its 10th year from September 16 to 19. The online conference both celebrates the games industry&#39;s developers of color, and acts as a showcase for new upcoming game through its companion GDoCExpo Direct showcase.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s GDoCExpo Direct kicks off the conference on September 16 at 4PM ET / 1PM ET on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@GDoCExpo/videos">Game Devs of Color Expo YouTube channel</a>. The direct is supposed to feature &quot;more than 30 games&quot; and it&#39;ll be paired with a Game Devs of Color Expo Steam Sale with discounts and demos to try for some of the games featured in the showcase.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Watching the Direct is free, but to view the Expo&#39;s developer interviews and live panels, you&#39;ll have to pay for a ticket. A regular ticket costs $50, but the Game Devs of Color nonprofit organization also offers cheaper ways to attend for anyone who can&#39;t afford the ticket price. This year&#39;s conference includes talks on budgeting, design leadership and &quot;Decolonizing Cozy Games.&quot;</p>
<p>Game Devs of Color has been running the Game Devs of Color Expo since 2016, with the explicit mission of amplifying &quot;the creative power held by people of color in games.&quot; The Expo and Direct attempt to make industry knowledge and marketing opportunities accessible to creators, but the organization also helps directly fund game projects through grants. Game Devs of Color says it&#39;ll award $15,000 in &quot;no-strings development grants&quot; to developers at the Expo this year, and that it&#39;s awarded &quot;a total of $405,000&quot; since 2019.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/game-devs-of-color-expo-2025-starts-on-september-16-204559199.html?src=rss
