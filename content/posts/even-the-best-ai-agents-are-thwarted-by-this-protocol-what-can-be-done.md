    Even the best AI agents are thwarted by this protocol - what can be done
     
    The increasingly popular Model Context Protocol lets AI models access applications, but studies show that the best generative AI bots struggle with planning across a variety of tasks.

Top AI models such as Google's Gemini 5 require many, many rounds of interactions with the external programs, leading to long delays in the performance of the AI models. Also: What is Model Context Protocol? The emerging standard bridging AI and data, explained"Even state-of-the-art models struggle with different capabilities," writes Zhenting Wang and team at consulting firm Accenture, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and the University of California at Berkeley in an August work that introduced MCP-Bench, a set of 250 tasks for AI agents employing MCP."Performance generally declines as tasks transition from Single Server to Multi Server scopes," writes Zikang Guo and team at the University of Science and Technology of China last month when they tested several AI models on their own benchmark test, MCP-AgentBench
