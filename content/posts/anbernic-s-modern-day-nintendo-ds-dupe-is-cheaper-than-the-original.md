<p>After remaking every <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-2024-new">Game Boy model</a> imaginable, Anbernic is ready to take on the next frontier of classic gaming handhelds: the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-20-years-since-the-launch-of-nintendos-most-important-console">Nintendo DS</a>. In its usual drip-feed fashion, the handheld maker released a teaser video revealing the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvlpBaUs79c">Anbernic RG DS</a>. The company didn&#39;t offer many details for its Nintendo DS clone, but announced that it would cost less than $100.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That price tag isn&#39;t surprising for anyone who&#39;s been following Anbernic&#39;s recipe of recreating iconic handhelds at an affordable price point. However, it&#39;s still an attractive price point that&#39;s even cheaper than the Nintendo DS&#39; original MSRP of $149.99. Beyond price, Anbernic hinted at a possible new chip and showed off four colorways, including black/red, teal, white and transparent.</p>

<p>Anbernic hasn&#39;t announced a release date yet, but the company often starts selling its devices shortly after the first reveal video. Once available, the Anbernic RG DS will compete against the more premium <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayn-reveals-a-nintendo-ds-style-handheld-that-comes-in-the-classic-game-boy-color-purple-194416424.html">Ayn Thor</a> that starts at $250. It&#39;s important to note that Anbernic <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/retro-handheld-maker-anbernic-stops-us-shipments-due-to-tariffs-220217833.html">paused shipments</a> from its Chinese warehouses to US customers in April following the tariff changes, meaning American buyers were limited to Anbernic&#39;s US stock. The previous notice has since been removed, but the Trump administration recently announced another <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/trump-xi-china-tariffs-rare-earth.html">retaliatory tariff</a> on all Chinese goods.</p>
