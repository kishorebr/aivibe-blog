<p>Meta is shutting down the standalone Messenger website, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Facebook;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=58a137b8-4748-4ad2-b1db-003c79a332f5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=68b2958d-a995-4104-a881-c6776f7210f6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Facebook&amp;linkText=according+to+a+company+help+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vaGVscC9tZXNzZW5nZXItYXBwLzgwNDEzMjI3MTk1Nzc4OSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjhiMjk1OGQtYTk5NS00MTA0LWE4ODEtYzY3NzZmNzIxMGY2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vaGVscC9tZXNzZW5nZXItYXBwLzgwNDEzMjI3MTk1Nzc4OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATHNtTAhTvpzI7_nSi5jhGXrhjT5jNyc8ZTP6E7-jO-3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Fmessenger-app%2F804132271957789" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/804132271957789"><ins>according to a company help page</ins></a>. The website will disappear in April, though web users will still be able to send and receive messages within Facebook.</p>
<p>&quot;After messenger.com goes away, you will be automatically redirected to use facebook.com/messages for messaging on a computer,&quot; the help page reads. &quot;You can continue your conversations there or on the Messenger mobile app.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users will be able to restore their chat history after switching to the app by entering a PIN number. This is the same PIN that was used to initially create a backup on Messenger. It can be reset for those who simply don&#39;t have the bandwidth to remember yet another six-digit code.</p>
<p>Many users <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1r6pxzp/why_does_meta_keep_removing_every_service_that/">have expressed discontent</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/_snow118/status/2023722050783945129">over the decision</a> to shut down the standalone website, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/meta-is-shutting-down-messengers-standalone-website/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. This is particularly true for those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts but continued to use Messenger.</p>
<p>This comes just a few months after <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-shutting-down-its-desktop-messenger-app-202539375.html"><ins>Meta shut down Messenger&#39;s standalone desktop apps</ins></a>. At that time, Meta directed existing users to Facebook to continue using the service and not the dedicated Messenger website. In other words, the writing has likely been on the wall since October.</p>
<p>Messenger has had a long and storied history. The platform first launched as Facebook Chat all the way back in 2008. Facebook Messenger became a standalone app in 2011. The company has long-tried to make Messenger a thing outside of Facebook. It removed messaging capabilities from the main Facebook app in 2014 and began <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-04-facebook-shoves-mobile-web-users-toward-the-messenger-app.html"><ins>directing users to the Messenger app</ins></a>.
