    Apple doesn't need better AI as much as AI needs Apple to bring its A-game

Here's what analysts are predictingStill, the new AI revolution that is sweeping the tech industry -- and soon the planet -- is in desperate need of many of the qualities that Apple usually exemplifies in its approach to products. I'm talking about qualities like polish, attention-to-detail, user trust, and patience.While generative AI is racing forward at a breakneck pace, it continues to feel half-baked and overhyped much of the time. I'm confident that's why ZDNET/Aberdeen research showed that only 8% of the broader public say they're willing to pay for AI features on their devices. Even more challenging, 69% said they woul
