<p>Get ready for your game library to grow, because the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam Summer Sale</a> is open and ready for business. The promotion runs through July 11, so you've got plenty of time to peruse all of the available deals, but there are a couple fun highlights in this season's selections.</p>
<p>For starters, two likely contenders for 2025 game of the year are on sale. You can pick up the spectacular puzzle game <em>Blue Prince</em> for 15 percent off or about $25, and the lush <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-an-original-hit-rpg-090012488.html"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has a slight discount of 10 percent, which puts it at $45. I'm sad they didn't go thematic and make it $33, but even a small price cut is nice for games this recent.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A couple other newish releases are available at smaller discounts. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-great-movie-good-game-000029449.html"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a> is 20 percent off, as is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, while <em>Civilization VII</em> is 15 percent off. The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is down to $42 thanks to a 40 percent cut.</p>
<p>Most of the biggest deals are on older titles. For instance, if you don't already own the excellent <em>Doom</em> (2016), it's only $4 with an 80 percent off discount. Or pick up <em>Death Stranding Director's Cut</em> for just $16.</p>
<p>Steam sales are also a prime chance to add more indies to your library. For multiplayer mayhem, <em>Human Fall Flat</em> and <em>Overcooked 2</em> are each $6. You can explore the beautiful underwater world of <em>Abzu</em> for just $5. <em>Chicory: A Colorful Tale</em> is half off at $10 and <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> is down to $20.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the highlights. Now you just have to find the time to play everything you buy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-steam-summer-sale-is-live-with-a-fresh-batch-of-big-discounts-190844050.html?src=rss
