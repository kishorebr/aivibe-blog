<p>Rode is rolling out a firmware update for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-pro-mic-kit-lets-you-forget-about-clipped-audio-000028417.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Wireless Pro</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/rodes-latest-wireless-go-microphone-system-boasts-40-hours-of-on-board-storage-230014651.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Wireless Go (third-gen)</a> microphones to add a feature called Direct Connect, which was already available for the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/rodes-tiny-149-wireless-micro-kit-is-designed-for-smartphone-users-150040695.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Wireless Micro</a>. This allows the mics to pair with iPhones and iPads via Bluetooth without the need for a receiver. All you’ll need is the Rode Capture app. </p><p>Rode said it’s able to offer Direct Connect for Wireless Pro and Wireless Go without compromising “the broadcast-quality audio both wireless systems are known for.” The feature still supports the option to record from two transmitters in either merged (whereby the audio blends into a single stereo track) or split (which keeps the recordings on separate channels to allow for more options in post-production) modes.</p><p>Not having to worry about setting up a physical receiver to link these mics to iOS devices could help streamline things quite a bit for creators. And I can always get behind companies adding handy features to existing products without pushing customers to buy new models. That’s good for the environment, your wallet — assuming you already have one of these mics — and probably the company’s reputation. An all-around positive update. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/more-rode-mics-can-now-connect-directly-to-iphones-and-ipads-230000533.html?src=rss
