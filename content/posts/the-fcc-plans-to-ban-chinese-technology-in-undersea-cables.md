<p>The Federal Communication Commission plans to vote on new rules that will ban the use of Chinese technology in undersea cables, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413027A1.pdf">a press release from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr</a>. The proposed rules will apply to any company on the FCC's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/supplychain/coveredlist">existing list of entities</a> that pose "an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States."</p>
<p>Besides "prohibiting the use of 'covered' equipment," the FCC's new rules will also limit the ability for Chinese companies to receive a license to build or operate cables that connect to the US. Undersea or submarine cables are a key piece of internet infrastructure, and a potential site of foreign espionage in the eyes of the FCC. Banning, or at least severely limiting the influence of Chinese companies is an attempt to benefit American cable providers while hurting the country's perceived enemies.</p>

Trump signed a law that required carriers to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-president-signs-secure-trusted-communications-networks-act.html">"rip and replace"</a> old Huawei and ZTE mobile infrastructure, and the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-huawei-zte-rip-replace-funding-211116669.html">FCC provisioned funding</a> to make it happen. The new rules around undersea cables are being proposed by a very different commission, though.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only three commissioners on the FCC, down from the typical five. Under Carr, the commission has taken a much more aggressive approach to regulating the telecommunications industry, bordering on violating the First Amendment. Carr has threatened to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/29/nx-s1-5344469/fcc-disney-dei-changes-abc">investigate companies</a> for their diversity, equity and inclusion policies and committed to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/fcc-approves-verizons-20-billion-merger-with-frontier-181434890.html">not approving any mergers</a> of companies that insist on keeping them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCC is expected to vote on the new rules on August 7. Besides being consistent with past FCC actions, they could be justified as a way of securing American infrastructure following the widespread <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-report-details-vast-spying-by-china-linked-telecom-hackers-010347224.html">"Salt Typhoon"</a> hack the affected US carriers and other companies last year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-fcc-plans-to-ban-chinese-technology-in-undersea-cables-215207536.html?src=rss
