<p>For anyone who has been following the soap opera unfolding between Netflix and Paramount Skydance over the past few months in their financial brinksmanship to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, the saga may be nearing its end. Today, WBD said its board of directors have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">determined</a> that the latest offer from Paramount Skydance amounted to the better proposal. The media outfit gave Netflix four business days to match Paramount&#39;s terms, but the streamer didn&#39;t waste any time in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">declining</a> to raise its own bid.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.&#39; iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US,&quot; the statement from Netflix&nbsp; co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said. &quot;But this transaction was always a &#39;nice to have&#39; at the right price, not a &#39;must have&#39; at any price.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the purchase price of $31 per WBD share, Paramount&#39;s latest offer also included a provision that it would cover the $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe to Netflix for dissolving the existing merger agreement between the businesses. So rather than paying <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">$82.7 billion</a> to acquire the Warner Bros. part of the operation, it appears Netflix may walk away with no new content but padding its coffers with an extra nearly $3 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>After Netflix&#39;s initial offer, Paramount Skydance swooped in with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a hostile takeover attempt</a> of the entire Warner Bros. Discovery business.

While WBD has not yet formally accepted Paramount&#39;s offer — which will be subject to long-winded regulatory approvals sure to spark more drama — it seems the dust will soon settle for this chapter.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-backs-out-of-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-233117188.html?src=rss
