LG is one of the first out of the gate, unveiling its "first-ever flagship RGB TV" -- the LG Micro RGB evo. At the core of the new display are micro-RGB LEDs, which the company says utilize "OLED precision to control each of the... backlights," delivering exceptional color accuracy.Also: The top 6 TVs our readers bought this year (No. 1 isn't a Sony or Samsung)Achieving this level of performance requires newly improved hardware and software working in tandem. Leading the charge is LG's Dual AI Engine-based Alpha 11 Processor Gen 3 SoC (system on a chip). As you can probably already guess, this chip leverages artificial intelligence to enhance image sharpness while balancing color output, resulting in a more immersive viewing experience.The hardware also "enables Primary Color Ultra", allowing the LG TV to fully support three different color gamuts: BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB.    The LG TV competes with Samsung's own Micro RGB LED TV, which debuted at CES 2025. Kerry Wan/ZDNETComplemen
