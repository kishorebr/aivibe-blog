<p>When talking about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, I frequently warn about the dangers of trusting free VPNs without verifying them. Although there are a few free VPNs worth recommending, many other free providers are ineffective, malicious or looking to profit off their users (or sometimes all three). Even the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best free VPNs</a> work a lot better once you subscribe and access their full service.<br><br>This can be frustrating if you want to enjoy the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">benefits of a VPN</a> but don&#39;t have the budget for yet another subscription. To help you out, I put together a list of the best paid VPN services you can get cheaply. Every name on the list comes with my full recommendation — I&#39;ll never recommend a VPN that doesn&#39;t protect you, no matter how affordable.<br><br>Before I get started, I want to define &quot;cheap,&quot; since VPNs often bamboozle the customer with muddled pricing schemes. Most providers have long-term subscription plans with big discounts, and many of them compensate by making their monthly plans more expensive. On this list, I&#39;ll recommend services with cheap subscriptions for both the short and long term, plus one favorite that balances both.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested-with-good-deals"><strong>Other VPNs we tested with good deals</strong></h2>
<p>A couple of VPNs have decent pricing options attached to worthy services but weren&#39;t quite strong enough to make the list. Both these services get my hearty recommendation; they&#39;re just hard to justify as &quot;cheap.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-expressvpn"><strong>ExpressVPN</strong></h3>
<p>ExpressVPN recently switched to a multi-tier pricing model. The Basic pricing tier gets you complete VPN service but doesn&#39;t include the full set of features. The best price on that is $78.18 for 28 months, which works out to $2.79 per month. Although that sounds great, it&#39;s more expensive than both Surfshark and CyberGhost at the same duration and renews at the even higher price of $99.95 per year ($8.33 per month).</p>
<p>Still, as I wrote in my full <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">ExpressVPN review</a>, it&#39;s an outstanding service overall. Thanks to its sensible app layouts and focus on doing simple tasks well, I find it especially good for introducing beginners to what a VPN can do.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-nordvpn"><strong>NordVPN</strong></h3>
<p>NordVPN is another provider that I gave a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">relatively positive review</a>. I really like its boundary-pushing features, especially the various types of highly specialized servers. Its pricing isn&#39;t bad, exactly, but even the Basic level is more expensive than just about everyone else at every duration. NordVPN&#39;s fast download speeds and wide server network make it worthwhile for lots of users, but it&#39;s hard to recommend to people on a budget.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-good-cheap-vpn"><strong>What to look for in a good cheap VPN</strong></h2>
<p>Looking for an affordable VPN is the same as looking for any kind of VPN; it just requires more care. The worst VPNs usually present themselves as free, but there&#39;s also a fair number of mediocre options that think low prices have to mean a mediocre service. If you want to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">use a VPN</a> but don&#39;t have much extra cash, take some additional care in a few areas of your search.</p>
<p>First, don&#39;t subscribe to a VPN — or even download any of its apps — if you haven&#39;t verified its security. To do that, start by checking what experts have to say about it. If a VPN is truly unsafe, chances are high that somebody has already sounded the alarm. You can also check the list of protocols the VPN offers. If it&#39;s anything other than OpenVPN, WireGuard or IKEv2, do a deep dive to make sure it&#39;s using worthwhile encryption.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve verified that the VPN isn&#39;t a virus, check to see if it has a free trial or a guaranteed money-back period. This will give you some risk-free time to do hands-on tests. Our article on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">how we test VPNs</a> includes several tests you can run on your own computer, phone or tablet. Check the VPN&#39;s speed, make sure it has the server locations you need and look for anything that might be leaking your real IP address.</p>
<p>Read the VPN&#39;s privacy policy and make sure you&#39;re comfortable with how much information it saves. Some VPNs emphasize privacy more than others. Finally, before your free trial or refund period expires, make sure to double-check on the pricing structure of the VPN you&#39;re choosing — it&#39;s possible that it will only be cheap for the first subscription period.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-cheap-vpn-170000957.html?src=rss
