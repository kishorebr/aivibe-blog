The original RedOctane was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-12-activision-shuts-down-redoctane-underground-development.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">shut down by Activision in 2010</a>, and only <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/redoctane-relaunches-and-will-continue-to-make-new-rhythm-games-211816411.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">recently reformed under Embracer Freemode</a> to create a new music game franchise in August 2025. </p><p><em>Stage Tour</em> is playable solo or with other players in a band, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stagetour.com/blogs/news/the-journey-begins" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">according to RedOctane</a>, and supports inputs from a keyboard and mouse on top of the expected guitar, drums and microphone accessories. The studio plans to primarily offer the game digitally, but hopes to also sell a bundle with a guitar controller and a download code because &quot;that just feels right.&quot; As far as ongoing support goes, whereas games like <em>Guitar Hero</em> or <em>Rock Band</em> included a set tracklist and support for song DLC, it sounds like RedOctane could be taking an approach more inspired by Epic&#39;s regular updates to <em>Fortnite</em>. &quot;The plan is regular special events that are more than just music drops,&quot; RedOctane writes. &quot;Real moments. Real themes. Real updates. We want to evolve the game alongside the fans who support it. Improve it. Expand it. Keep it alive.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>RedOctane and Harmonix created the first <em>Guitar Hero </em>in 2006, before RedOctane was acquired by Activision to continue the franchise in 2006, and Harmonix went on to start the <em>Rock Band</em> series. Development of <em>Stage Tour</em> is currently being led by RedOctane, with Eidos Montréal helping with motion capture and QA, and Third Kind Games providing additional development support. Conveniently, RedOctane’s owner Embracer Freemode also already owns CRKD, a video game accessory maker that has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/crkd-teamed-up-with-gibson-to-make-new-guitar-controllers-230204820.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">experience building controllers for rhythm games</a>.</p><p>Sign-ups to play an alpha of <em>Stage Tour</em> will open soon, and RedOctane plans to &quot;kick off closed alpha testing late spring/early summer.&quot; We&#39;re long past the peak popularity of games like Guitar Hero, but rhythm and music games never went away. Players have had <em>Clone Hero</em> and more official experiences like <em>Fortnite Festival</em> to get their Guitar Hero or Rock Band fix, but <em>Stage Tour</em> could be a more than welcome third option when it launches later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/guitar-hero-vets-redoctane-reveal-their-new-music-game-220809719.html?src=rss
