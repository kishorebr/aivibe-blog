    Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's free
     
    You can replace expensive, cloud-based AI coding with three tools. Here's how.

Whether it's a new development environment, a new language, a new plugin, or some new online service with an oh-so-powerful time-saving API, it's all "revolutionary" and "world-changing," at least according to the PR reps hawking The Big New Thing.And then there's agentic AI coding. When a tool can help you do four years of product development in four days, the impact is world-changing. While vibe coding has its detractors (for good reason), AI coding agents like OpenAI's Codex and Claude Code really are revolutionary. They are radically transforming the software industry. Also: I tried a Claude Code alternative that's local, open source, and completely free - how it worksIn my testing, I determined you can get a few hours of agentic coding done here and there with the $20/month plans from the AI companies. But if you're going to put in full days of coding, you'll need to upgrade to $100 or $200/month plans. Otherwise, you'll risk getting put on hold until your token allocation resets. While both OpenAI and Anthropic have repeatedly said they respect the privacy of code bases, the fact is that both are doing their work on cloud infrastructure. That effort has an inher
