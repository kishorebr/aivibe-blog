<p>The long-awaited cyberpunk platformer Replaced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1663850/view/525352058061062655?l=english">has been delayed once again</a>. Now it&#39;s not coming out until next spring. Developer Sad Cat Studio apologized for the delay and said that this is simply &quot;what&#39;s right for the project&quot; and that the team remains dedicated to creating a &quot;truly special experience.&quot;</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first time the game has suffered a delay. It was originally announced back in 2021, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/replaced-game-xbox-windows-182032719.html">with a pending release date of 2022</a>. That didn&#39;t happen. In 2024, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-pixelated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-has-been-pushed-back-to-2025-220802916.html">announced a release date of 2025</a>. As today&#39;s news indicates, that also isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>Why all of the delays? The company wants a polished finished product, sure, but the real world intervened on its original release plans. The company was based in Belarus before relocating <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">after Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine</a>. This was the primary factor behind those earlier delays.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Replaced</em> is a nifty-looking sidescrolling platformer that takes inspiration from old-school games like <em>Out of this World</em> (also called <em>Another World</em>) and <em>Flashback</em>. It looks soaked in cyberpunk vibes. Assuming there are no more delays, it&#39;ll come out next year for PC and Xbox Series X/S. The trailers have gotten us amped for this one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-again-this-time-until-spring-2026-182908044.html?src=rss
