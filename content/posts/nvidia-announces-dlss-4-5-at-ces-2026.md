<p>Just like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/nvidia-announced-dlss-4-will-come-to-all-rtx-gpus-044835926.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">last year</a>, NVIDIA has used some of its time on the CES stage to introduce an upgraded version of its real-time image-upscaling technology. The new DLSS 4.5 promises sharper visuals with the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which the company says will deliver better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing. The DLSS 4.5 also includes Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, which maximizes frame per second to monitor refresh rate, delivering up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance.</p><p>The 2nd Gen Transformer Super Resolution is available now for all RTX GPUs, while the Dynamic 6x Frame Generation will arrive some time in spring 2026 for the RTX 50 series. It will also be available for more than 400 games through the NVIDIA app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature is RTX Remix Logic, which allows real-time environmental reactions to in-game events. For instance, when a door is opened on screen, the NVIDIA tech can present changes to volumetric conditions, display different weather simulations with particles or alter materials. More than 30 different common events can be detected, and the RTX Remix Logic can make adaptations to volumetrics, particles, material properties and light properties.</p><p>NVIDIA noted that it now has native clients for both Linux and Fire TV. That&#39;s the roundup of major gaming updates from the company&#39;s CES presentation, but NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-keynote-with-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here-ai-robotics-updates-and-more-130028170.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">plenty to talk about</a> earlier today. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html?src=rss
