<p>French video game giant Ubisoft has been embroiled in a multiyear saga regarding a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-yves-guillemot-013025034.html"><ins>toxic company culture</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/five-former-ubisoft-execs-arrested-following-sexual-harassment-investigation-135636454.html"><ins>multiple sexual harassment investigations</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-harassment-lawsuit-france-205931367.html"><ins>harassment suits</ins></a> filed by former employees. In 2023, five former Ubisoft executives were arrested on various charges related to these investigations. On Wednesday, a French court sentenced three of them to suspended sentences for enabling a culture rife with sexual and psychological harassment.</p>
<p>Former editorial vice president Thomas Francois was convicted on additional charges of attempted sexual assault and received a suspended three-year term. Francois was alleged to have perpetrated a bevy of sexual assaults at the workplace and held a pattern of egregious sexual harassment.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Various other executives, including former chief creative officer Serge Hascoet and former games director Guillaume Patrux, were sentenced to shorter suspended sentences. They also faced fines of up to $35,000. These convictions come years after anonymous reports of a toxic work culture at Ubisoft began <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-allegations-092903220.html"><ins>spreading online</ins></a>, and the company launched an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-yves-guillemot-013025034.html"><ins>internal investigation</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Maude Beckers, an attorney for the plaintiffs, celebrated the convictions as a victory against workplace harassment, saying, &quot;This is a very good decision today and for the future.&quot; She added, &quot;For all companies, it means that when there is toxic management, managers must be held accountable and employers can no longer let it slide.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/former-ubisoft-executives-convicted-in-france-184919411.html?src=rss
