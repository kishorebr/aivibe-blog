In addition to adding a new mountain area with two new dungeons, <em>Woolhaven</em> will introduce ranching, so you can raise animals — the regular, <em>non</em>-anthropomorphic kind — to keep as pets, shear for wool or slaughter for meat (you know, if you have no heart).</p><p>Based on the overview video, we&#39;ll get to raise cows(ish), goats and sheep as well as some more unexpected critters like crabs, snails, spiders and turtles. I, personally, am very excited about the snails. You&#39;ll be able to form bonds with and name the animals, and you&#39;ll have to tend to their wellbeing, feeding them healthy foods and cleaning them. Followers will also be able to bond with the animals and have their own pets. As wholesome as that all sounds, this is <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> we&#39;re talking about, so I&#39;m already bracing myself for the inevitable heartbreak of when some unruly follower kills my favorite animals at some point. The video notes that you&#39;ll have to keep them safe from predators.</p><p><em>Woolhaven</em> will be a paid expansion, but we don&#39;t know yet how much it will cost or when exactly it drops.
