<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is making videos created with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670181/google-deepmind-ai-videos-app-flow-veo-3-2-imagen-4-io-2025">AI filmmaking tool Flow</a> even more realistic — and harder to identify as AI-generated at first glance. The company <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/veo-updates-flow/">announced Wednesday</a> that users can add in and change the shadows and lighting of their AI videos. The expanded editing features in Flow are tied to the <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-veo-3-1-and-new-creative-capabilities-in-the-gemini-api/">Veo 3.1 update</a>, also announced on Wednesday, which Google says does a better job of making a video based on the images submitted as a prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Flow users will also be able to generate videos with audio using several of the tool’s new features. Users can make a video with audio based on three reference images that the company calls “Ingredients to Video.” Another feature, called “Frames to Video,” creates a video that bridges a starting image with an ending image, with accompanying audio. The “Scene Extension” feature lets you take the final second of a clip and add on additional generated video up to a minute in length, also with generated audio. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Veo 3.1 costs the same as Veo 3, is available as part of a “paid preview” through Gemini API to developers, and is enabled in the Gemini app.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Google, Flow users will soon be able to remove “anything” from a video — the tool will restructure the background and scene to make “it look as though the object was never there.”</p>
