Kaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.

Co-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.

Kaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.

The Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and
