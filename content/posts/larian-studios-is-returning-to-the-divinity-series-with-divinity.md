Two years after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-040406055.html" data-i13n="slk:taking home the Game of the Year prize;cpos:1;pos:1">taking home the Game of the Year prize</a> for <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> at The Game Awards, the developer popped up again at the 2025 edition of the ceremony to announce its upcoming project, which is the next entry in the Divinity series.

The trailer itself is pretty gruesome. It references <em>The Wicker Man</em>, as large wooden effigies with people chained inside are set ablaze. I won’t spoil what else happens other than to say it’s pretty gruesome, so maybe don’t watch it quite yet if you’ve just had dinner.</p><p>Larian hasn’t announced a release window for <em>Divinity </em>yet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/larian-studios-is-returning-to-the-divinity-series-with-divinity-015833088.html?src=rss
