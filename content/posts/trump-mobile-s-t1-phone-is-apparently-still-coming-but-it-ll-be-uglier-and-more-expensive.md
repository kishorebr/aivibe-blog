The report revealed the near-final design of the T1 smartphone and uncovered some major changes with pricing and manufacturing.</p>
<p><em>The Verge</em> spoke with Don Hendrickson and Eric Thomas, two of the three execs behind <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-still-doesnt-exist-but-the-company-is-now-selling-refurbished-phones-191740570.html">Trump Mobile</a>, about the company&#39;s first smartphone, which will get a more expensive price tag and no longer boast being made in the USA. Thanks to a screenshot from the report, we can see that the latest T1 design also changed the camera array, which first resembled the iPhone&#39;s but now has three cameras in a misaligned vertical stack.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the price, Hendrickson told <em>The Verge</em> that anyone who paid the $100 deposit will still pay $499 total for the T1 as an &quot;introductory price,&quot; but that later customers could fork up to $999. Thomas also revealed that the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-golden-trump-phone-is-almost-certainly-not-made-in-the-us-174536590.html">T1 smartphone</a> will go through &quot;final assembly&quot; in Miami and no longer be &quot;proudly designed and built in the United States,&quot; as seen in the introductory <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service">press release</a>. Instead, the website now shows a description that says, &quot;with American hands behind every device.&quot; We still don&#39;t have a release date — and now we don&#39;t even have a final price — but the website still claims the T1 smartphone will be released &quot;later this year.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-phone-is-apparently-still-coming-but-itll-be-uglier-and-more-expensive-190626835.html?src=rss
