<p>Tesla is still on the hook for $243 million after a US judge rejected the EV maker&#39;s bid to overturn a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-found-partially-liable-for-a-deadly-2019-crash-193612682.html">jury verdict</a> from last year. On Friday, US District Judge Beth Bloom upheld the jury&#39;s decision to hold Tesla partially responsible for a deadly crash that happened in 2019 and involved the self-driving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-stops-using-autopilot-to-promote-its-evs-in-california-112533060.html">Autopilot</a> feature.</p>
<p>The judge added that there was enough evidence to support the jury&#39;s verdict, which was delivered in August 2025 and ordered Tesla to pay millions in compensatory and punitive damages to the two victims in the case.

The Model S then crashed into an SUV that was parked on a shoulder, where Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo were standing aside. Benavides was killed in the crash, while Angulo was severely injured.</p>
<p>Tesla hasn&#39;t publicly commented on Judge Bloom&#39;s decision yet, but it won&#39;t be a surprise to see the company appeal the latest ruling with a higher court. Tesla&#39;s lawyers previously tried to pin the blame on the driver, claiming that the Model S and Autopilot weren&#39;t defective. As this major case plays out, Tesla is also facing several investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for both its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/feds-investigate-tesla-over-inaccurate-autopilot-and-fsd-crash-reports-175837772.html">Autopilot</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html">Full-Self Driving</a> features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-judge-ruled-tesla-still-has-to-pay-243-million-for-a-fatal-crash-involving-autopilot-174548093.html?src=rss
