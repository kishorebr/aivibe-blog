			Meta is reportedly building AI smart glasses with Prada, too

			
Meta is working on a pair of AI smart glasses with the Italian high fashion brand, Prada, according to a report from CNBC on Tuesday. It’s unclear at this time when Meta’s Prada smart glasses will be publicly announced.

The reported Prada collaboration signifies that Meta aims to bring its AI smart glasses technology to more fashion companies outside of its relationship with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. Until now, Meta has collaborated closely with EssilorLuxottica and its numerous brands. Prada is not owned by EssilorLuxottica, although the fashion brand has relied on the company to help build its eyewear for decades and the companies just renewed their partnership.


	
	




	
	



Meta has already sold millions of Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses. Earlier this week, the company teased a collaboration with another EssilorLuxottica brand, Oakley, as Bloomberg previously reported. CNBC reports that those Oakley smart glasses, which could be announced as soon as Friday, may cost around $360.
