<p>Meta is throwing its resources behind a new super PAC in California. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/26/exclusive-meta-to-launch-california-super-pac-focused-on-ai-00524989"><em>Politico</em></a>, the group will support state-level political candidates who espouse tech-friendly policies, particularly those with a loose approach to regulating artificial intelligence. The budget behind the social media company&#39;s new super PAC, dubbed Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars, but no exact figure has been disclosed.</p>
<p>California has made several efforts, with varying degrees of success, to enact protections against potentially harmful AI use cases. The state passed a law <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-passes-landmark-regulation-to-require-permission-from-actors-for-ai-deepfakes-174234452.html"><ins>protecting the digital likenesses of actors</ins></a> in 2024, but has faced challenges to a bill that blocked <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/judge-blocks-new-california-law-barring-distribution-of-election-related-ai-deepfakes-133043341.html"><ins>election misinformation deepfakes</ins></a> and to one that more broadly sought <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-gov-newsom-vetoes-bill-sb-1047-that-aims-to-prevent-ai-disasters-220826827.html"><ins>protections against &quot;critical harm&quot;</ins></a> caused by AI.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This creation of the super PAC puts Meta into a prominent position to influence races in 2026, when California will have midterm elections and vote for a new governor. &quot;Sacramento’s regulatory environment could stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California’s technology leadership at risk,&quot; said Brian Rice, vice president of public policy at Meta. Politico reported that Rice and Meta policy executive Greg Maurer are likely to lead the political fundraiser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta hasn&#39;t been shy about throwing money into politics to advance its business interests. According to OpenSecrets, the company has spent <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000033563"><ins>$13.7 million</ins></a> on lobbying to date this year.
