<p>The US International Trade Commission has determined that Chinese camera company Insta360 has infringed on at least some of GoPro's patents. Based on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/ITC-Determines-Infringement-of-GoPros-Iconic-HERO-Camera-Design/default.aspx">a press release from GoPro</a>, the determination specifically found that "Insta360 violated federal law by importing and selling in the United States products that infringe GoPro intellectual property."</p>
<p>GoPro writes that it was "pleased" the ITC's judge found that Insta360 infringed on "a patent covering GoPro's iconic Hero camera design." The company also says that the ITC's judge validated multiple patent claims related to its HyperSmooth video stabilization feature, though the patents notably weren't considered infringed, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/documents/notice_of_issuance_final_idrd_1400.pdf">according to the notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When asked to comment on the ITC determination notice, Insta360 didn't portray the ruling as a GoPro victory, though. If anything, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insta360-issues-statement-on-us-itc-initial-determination-302503523.html">the company's statement</a> makes it seem like the opposite. Insta360's press release says that the ITC "rejected GoPro's utility patent claims against Insta360." According to the company, the judge determined that utility patents "relating to stabilization, horizon leveling, distortion, and aspect ratio conversion are invalid, not infringed, or both." Only GoPro's design patent was infringed and valid, and Insta360 says it's implemented design updates to address it.</p>
<p>"The US International Trade Commission's initial determination affirms what many in our industry already know: the future belongs to innovators, not litigators," Insta360 CEO JK Liu shared in the company's press release. "While GoPro sought to block competition by asserting a wide array of patents, the majority of those claims were either found not to be infringed or ruled invalid. That speaks volumes."</p>
<p>The ITC initially started investigating Insta360 on GoPro's suggestion, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-panel-probe-gopros-claims-that-chinese-firm-violated-its-patents-2024-05-01/"><em>Reuters </em>reports</a>. The company was specifically seeking "exclusion and cease and desist orders that would ban imports of the Insta360 products" in the US. Even if the ITC has found ways Insta360 infringes on GoPro's patents, the initial determination doesn't prevent the company from importing and selling its cameras.  You're still able to buy Insta360 products in the US.</p>
<p>The ITC is expected to deliver a final determination on November 10, 2025, according to GoPro. If the company seems defensive, there's good reason. Even if GoPro is still the most recognizable name in action cameras, Insta360 offers a far wider, and in some cases, more appealing selection of products. Things would be far simpler for GoPro if its competition wasn't allowed to sell its products in the US.</p>
