<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is bringing its Veo 3 AI video generation model, which my colleague Allison Johnson recently called “a slop monger’s dream,” to YouTube Shorts later this summer, according to a Cannes Lions keynote <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/neal-mohan-cannes-2025/">from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shorts creators can already take advantage of the previous-generation Veo 2 model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612031/youtube-ai-generated-video-shorts-veo-2-dream-screen">to generate</a> backgrounds with Dream Screen as well as standalone clips. Mohan didn’t specify exactly what Veo 3 will enable in Shorts, but he did mention Veo 3’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670181/google-deepmind-ai-videos-app-flow-veo-3-2-imagen-4-io-2025">improved video quality</a> and that it can incorporate audio, so presumably those upgrades will be coming to Shorts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also unclear if Shorts creators will have to pay to use Veo 3. Right now, generating Veo 3 videos requires a paid subscription to Google’s AI Pro or AI Ultra plans. Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mohan also announced that Shorts are now averaging more than 200 billion views per day.</p>
