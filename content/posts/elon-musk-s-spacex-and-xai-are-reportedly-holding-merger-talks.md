<p>Two Elon Musk companies are reportedly planning to merge. On Thursday, <em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> that SpaceX and xAI are holding merger talks ahead of a planned IPO. Part of their plan is to launch AI data centers into space (but unfortunately, only as far as Earth&#39;s orbit).</p><p>Last week, it was reported that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musk-is-reportedly-trying-to-take-spacex-public-170337053.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Musk planned to take SpaceX public</a> despite having once said it wouldn’t happen until the company had a presence on Mars. Now, the IPO could happen as early as this year. Shares of xAI would reportedly be exchanged for shares in SpaceX under the merger. <em>Reuters</em> reports that two entities were set up in Nevada on January 21 to facilitate the deal. </p><p>If the idea of two Musk companies becoming one sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it happened less than a year ago. In March 2025, xAI bought X, putting Grok (known for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">nonconsensual &quot;nudifying&quot; images</a>) and X (infamous for being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-gave-x-users-its-opinion-on-white-genocide-in-south-africa-whether-they-liked-it-or-not-151803191.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a far-right hellscape</a>) together <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">under one unholy roof</a>.</p><p>The latest idea Musk is pitching is blasting AI data centers off into space. At last week&#39;s gathering of the rich and powerful in Davos, Switzerland, he said, &quot;The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.&quot; The idea is that data centers in orbit could harness solar power and reduce cooling costs. However, industry analysts and executives consider it a risky bet, questioning whether the savings would warrant the massive investment. If or when the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI bubble bursts</a>, the plan could go down in flames — if not literally, then figuratively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-are-reportedly-holding-merger-talks-211740150.html?src=rss
