<p>If you have a new-ish Mac mini that has recently conked out, you are not alone. Apple has just launched a worldwide <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-launches-2023-mac-mini-repair-program/">service program</a> for the 2023 Mac mini with M2 chips, because "a very small percentage" of them are having power issues and may no longer turn on. The company didn't say what was causing those power issues. While Mac minis powered by M2 chips were <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html">first released in 2023</a>, the affected units were made between June 16, 2024 to November 23, 2024. Some of those computers may be nearing the end of their one-year warranty, depending on when they were purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this service program, Apple will still repair the units even if they're already past their warranty, up to three years after their first sale. To check if yours is eligible either because you need it now or in case you'll need it later, you can type in your Mac mini's serial number on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1fb21f20-d008-42bb-928a-d4ff7d7058af&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+program+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL21hYy1taW5pLTIwMjMtc2VydmljZS1wcm9ncmFtLWZvci1uby1wb3dlci1pc3N1ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZiMjFmMjAtZDAwOC00MmJiLTkyOGEtZDRmZjdkNzA1OGFmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL21hYy1taW5pLTIwMjMtc2VydmljZS1wcm9ncmFtLWZvci1uby1wb3dlci1pc3N1ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXy5ne4nM2SsIdtCYQSEs4CUBiXhskG5pbszYk1kTldW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fmac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.apple.com/mac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue">the program page</a>. Both Apple and its authorized service providers will fix your computer free of charge. Keep in mind if you've moved countries, however, that Apple may restrict or limit free repairs to the device's original country or region of purchase.&nbsp;</p>

They're half the size of previous versions, come with 16GB of RAM, several USB-C ports, a headphone jack, a full-sized HDMI connection (supporting up to 8K 60Hz or 4K 240Hz), as well as an Ethernet port.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-will-repair-some-mac-minis-powered-by-m2-chips-for-free-160048076.html?src=rss
