<p>The next game from <em>Left 4 Dead</em> designer Mike Booth is putting a sci-fi spin on his last game&#39;s co-op action, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-5ieEtmgTc"><ins>based on a trailer</ins></a> Booth and producer JJ Abrams shared at The Game Awards 2025. The new game is called <em>4:LOOP</em>, and it&#39;s the first project entirely developed by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-08-j-j-abrams-bad-robot-gaming-tencent.html"><ins>Bad Robot Games</ins></a>, film production company Bad Robot&#39;s game studio.</p>
<p><em>4:LOOP</em> combines the four-player co-op action of <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, with roguelike elements enabled by what seems like a time loop mechanic. Based on the trailer, players fight a mixture of aliens and robots in each mission, all in the hopes of eventually drawing the attention of an alien mothership and destroying it.</p>

<p>&quot;Each time the four-player team succeeds in a mission, they make choices to improve their equipment, building out a unique kit to survive the epic boss battle at the end of the Act,&quot; Booth said <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/"><ins>in an interview with PlayStation Blog</ins></a>. &quot;If the team completes all three Acts, they defeat the Mothership and save the world. All of this is, of course, easier said than done.&quot;</p>
