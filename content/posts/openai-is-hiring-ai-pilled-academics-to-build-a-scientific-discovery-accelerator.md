Now OpenAI is setting out to turn that vision into reality.The company is launching an initiative called OpenAI for Science, aimed at building "the next great scientific instrument: an AI-powered platform that accelerates scientific discovery," according to a Tuesday X post from company Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil. The timeline for the project is not yet known; Weil added in his post that more information would arrive in the coming months.Also: Every AI model is flunking medicine - and LMArena proposes a fix(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)Weil, who will lead the effort, wrote that OpenAI will hire a team of "world-class" academics who are "completely AI-pilled" and "great science communicators" to join a small group of researchers already employed by the company.What can we expect from the project?Not much is known at this point about the "platform" that Weil and his fledgling team plans to build. But his X post hints at some aspects of the scientific process that OpenAI for Science might try to more effectively automate. Weil wrote t
