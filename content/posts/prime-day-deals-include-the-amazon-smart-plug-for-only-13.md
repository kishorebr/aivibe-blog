This is 48 percent off and a record-low, as the typical price is $25. It just might be time to stock up.</p> 
<p>The Smart Plug is pretty handy. It plugs into any standard outlet and integrates with Alexa. This means that it provides voice control to many common household items like lamps and coffee makers. It made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-plug-131542429.html">best smart plugs</a> and this is especially true for those already tied into Amazon's ecosystem.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="eb811c0de3fa461fa804a194f11286c9" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089DR29T6?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>It's extremely easy to set up and use, particularly for folks who have some experience with the Alexa app. It doesn't require a smart home hub, as the app itself handles adjustments. The compact design also ensures there's room for another plug in a standard two-outlet fixture. The plug will automatically reconnect to Alexa after a power or Wi-Fi outage.</p> 
<p>We came away impressed with some of the features here. The app allows users to create routines, and we got a small thrill by saying "Alexa, goodnight" and watching everything power down for the evening.</p> 
<p>The major drawback here is the app's lack of sharing capabilities. The app doesn't let other people in the home access smart home devices, though they should be able to turn stuff on and off with their voice. However, they won't be able to make routines or adjust settings. It's also not the cheapest smart plug on the market, but this sale handles that for now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-deals-include-the-amazon-smart-plug-for-only-13-230012394.html?src=rss
