It&#39;s called <em>Ontos</em>, and it&#39;s slated to launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox next year. The trailer debuted during The Game Awards 2025.</p><p>The company&#39;s past projects include <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em> and <em>SOMA</em>, and this new title is also looking pretty dang creepy. It looks like things will take a philosophical turn, with a story of trying to piece together your father&#39;s past that leads you to questioning the meaning of life and reality. The team is going big with the casting, with Stellan Skarsgård playing one of the main roles in the trailer. This is one that any horror fans will want to keep on their radar. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-devs-of-soma-are-back-with-a-spiritual-successor-called-ontos-021535060.html?src=rss
