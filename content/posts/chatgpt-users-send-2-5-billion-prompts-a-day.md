			ChatGPT users send 2.5 billion prompts a day

			
ChatGPT receives 2.5 billion prompts from global users every day, OpenAI told Axios. About 330 million of those are coming from users in the U.S.

These numbers show just how ubiquitous OpenAI’s flagship product is becoming.


	
	




	
	



Google’s parent company, Alphabet, does not release daily search data, but recently revealed that Google receives 5 trillion queries per year, which averages to just under 14 billion daily searches. Independent researchers have found similar trends. Neil Patel of NP Digital estimates that Google receives 13.7 billion searches daily, while research from SparkToro and Datos — two digital marketing companies — estimates that the figure is around 16.4 billion per day.

Still, ChatGPT has shown impressively rapid growth. In December, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users send over 1 billion queries to ChatGPT each day. At Altman’s word, the company’s search volume has more than doubled in around eight months.
