<p>Apple is considering using AI models from OpenAI or Anthropic to deliver the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">more capable version of Siri</a> it debuted at WWDC 2024, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>. The company has promised it could deliver a new version of its voice assistant that understands personal context and takes action inside of apps since last year, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">officially delayed the updated Siri</a> in March 2025.</p>
<p>As part of this proposed new plan, Apple has asked Anthropic and OpenAI to train versions of its models that can run on Apple's Private Cloud Compute, secure servers running on Apple chips. The company already relies on its servers for certain AI features that can't be run locally.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple uses OpenAI's ChatGPT for some parts of Apple Intelligence, but completely relying on a third-party company for Siri would be a major departure. "The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models," <em>Bloomberg</em> writes,"and had been planning a new version of its voice assistant that runs on that technology for 2026." One of the few <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-announcements-at-wwdc-everything-apple-revealed-for-ios-macos-and-more-171133645.html">AI announcements Apple made at WWDC 2025</a> was to make those foundation models available to third-party developers.</p>
<p>Even considering using third-party AI models reflects internal changes at Apple. Leadership of the company's AI teams has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/apple-to-strip-secret-robotics-unit-from-ai-chief-weeks-after-moving-siri">reportedly changed hands</a> from John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, to Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering. Separately, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports Apple's Siri team is now being led by Mike Rockwell, who most recently oversaw the development of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Apple Vision Pro</a>.</p>
<p>As <em>Bloomberg </em>notes, an Anthropic or OpenAI-powered Siri would actually mirror Samsung's current approach to AI. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-ai-becomes-more-personal-and-cohesive-180029521.html">Galaxy AI</a> relies on some custom Samsung software, but primarily uses Google's Gemini. Using third-party models wouldn't preclude Apple from switching back to something in-house in the future. The company made a similar transition — albeit, perhaps too early —  when it went from a Maps app that relied on Google Maps to its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-11-apple-officially-gives-google-maps-the-boot-launches-own-maps-a.html">custom Apple Maps service</a> in 2012.</p>
<p>Wherever Apple lands, the updated version of Siri isn't expected to launch now <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html">until 2026</a>. The company will ship a more modest collection of AI-adjacent features this fall with the launch of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-new-ios-26-features-and-its-liquid-glass-redesign-at-wwdc-2025-171650243.html">iOS 26</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">macOS 26</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-may-power-siri-with-anthropic-or-openai-models-amid-ai-struggles-212028351.html?src=rss
