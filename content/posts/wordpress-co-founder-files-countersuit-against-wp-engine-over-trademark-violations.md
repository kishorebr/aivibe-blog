<p>There's been another turn in Automattic and WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg’s ongoing legal battle with WordPress provider WP Engine.

Automattic claims products WP Engine released like "Core WordPress" and "Headless WordPress" further obfuscated the company’s role, while WP Engine also failed to commit a promised "five percent of its resources to support the WordPress project."</p><p>The counterclaim goes on to say that Automattic and Mullenweg tried to work out these issues with WP Engine by offering a "fair trademark license," but the company only "pretended to engage in licensing discussions," while actually delaying any kind of agreement because it would "impact its earnings." Keeping earnings up was important to WP Engine because Silver Lake was allegedly trying to sell WP Engine at a $2 billion valuation, and had even made "overtures to Automattic" about it.<br><br>A WP Engine spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>WP Engine’s use of the WordPress trademark to refer to the open-source software is consistent with longstanding industry practice and fair use under settled trademark law, and we will defend against these baseless claims.</p></blockquote><p>Auttomatic’s countersuit tells a different story than the one WP Engine spun in its original lawsuit against the company, which accused Mullenweg of "abuse of power, extortion and greed." WP Engine's original complaint claimed that Automattic asked the company for eight percent of its monthly revenue as a royalty payment. Mullenweg's attempts to punish WP Engine were seen as so aggressive at the time that over 100 Automattic employees <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/159-employees-leave-wordpress-founders-company-after-extortion-lawsuit-133040801.html" data-i13n="slk:voluntarily left;cpos:4;pos:1">voluntarily left</a> the company in response.
