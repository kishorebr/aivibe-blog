<p>The Initiative, the Xbox studio developing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/perfect-dark-reboot-trailer-shows-joanna-dark-hunting-bad-guys-in-a-near-future-cairo-180150819.html">a modern reimagining of <em>Perfect Dark</em></a><em>, </em>is being shut down, and development of the game is ending. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative"><em>Windows Central,</em></a> the studio's closure is part of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html">major cuts</a> Microsoft is making across its business, affecting around four percent of the company's global workforce.</p>
<p>Based on a memo from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty obtained by <em>Windows Central</em>, which Microsoft has confirmed is genuine, the decision to close The Initiative was born out of the cancellation of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, rather than the other way around. "We have made the decision to stop development of <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild</em> as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty wrote. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative."</p>

The game was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-rare-everwild-xbox.html">announced in 2019</a> but has had a troubled development, even <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/why-wasnt-everwild-at-e3-its-been-completely-rebooted/">starting from scratch in 2021</a>. <em>Perfect Dark</em>, based on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Dark#Reboot">the older Rare game of the same name</a>, was supposed to be The Initiative's first project. The game was being co-developed in partnership with Crystal Dynamics.

<p>While cancelled games are the most visible impact of Microsoft's layoffs, it increasingly sounds like countless studios will end up being affected in one way or another. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"><em>Bloomberg's </em>Jason Schreier</a> writes that <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Raven is also facing cuts, and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> developer Turn 10 could end up losing around 50 percent of its staff.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html?src=rss
