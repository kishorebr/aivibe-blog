<p>It didn&#39;t take too long for a game that a whole bunch of people are <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">excited about</a> to swoop into <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>&#39;s old release week. Or maybe Rockstar had an idea of was what was coming and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html">delayed its blockbuster by six months</a> to get out of the way of <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, TT Games and Warner Bros. Games brought a new trailer to The Game Awards and revealed that the Caped Crusader&#39;s next adventure will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 29. The base game will cost $70 and pre-orders are open as of 11PM ET on December 11.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lego games often have a massive cast of characters and, as the trailer revealed, this one will be no different. It will feature the likes of Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl and Catwoman, as well as a murderer&#39;s row of super-villains, such as The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, The Penguin and Bane.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Games is announcing the release date at a bit of an awkward time. Netflix recently had an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html">$82.7 billion bid accepted</a> for a chunk of Warner Bros. Discovery that includes the gaming division. However, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters said the company didn&#39;t factor Warner Bros. Games into its valuation.</p>
<p>&quot;While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,&quot; Peters said, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/we-actually-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warners-game-studios-netflix-boss-says-about-the-acquisition-deal-theyre-relatively-minor-compared-to-the-grand-scheme-of-things/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>. &quot;Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, <em>Hogwarts </em>[<em>Legacy</em>] is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-swoops-onto-pc-and-consoles-on-may-29-024729940.html?src=rss
