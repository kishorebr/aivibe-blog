<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI and Oracle signed a deal “to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years,” one of the largest cloud computing deals ever, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?mod=e2twd">reports</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In July, the two companies revealed their partnership to build data centers worth 4.5 gigawatts of power as part of the broader <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348816/openai-softbank-ai-data-center-stargate-project">Stargate</a> project they announced with Softbank and President Trump, without explaining how much OpenAI planned to pay for the datacenters. OpenAI’s contract will begin in 2027, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/636958/openai-revenue-projection-bloomberg">reportedly expects $12.7 billion in revenue this year</a>, is also likely behind another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/772433/openai-custom-chip-production-broadcom">$10 billion contract</a> with the semiconductor giant Broadcom to design its own AI chip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While reporting <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000119312525199175/orcl-ex99_1.htm">quarterly earnings</a> on Tuesday, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced that three unnamed companies had signed “four multi-billion-dollar contracts&#8221; in Q1, part of a trend that she said is increasing Oracle&#8217;s cloud infrastructure revenue by 77 percent this year. Overall, the company said that in Q1 it added more than $317 billion in future contract revenue, a massive dollar amount that sent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-09/oracle-posts-strong-bookings-following-openai-cloud-deal">share prices soaring</a> and Chairman Larry Ellison to the top spot of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/775763/larry-ellison-oracle-elon-musk-richest-person">world’s richest person list</a>.&nbsp;</p>
