<p>We’ll soon get a closer look at a bunch of features and updates Google has planned for Android and its other services. The company has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2023847540400288134" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">confirmed</a> that Google I/O 2026 will take place on May 19 and 20<strong>. </strong>As always, Google will stream some of the keynotes and sessions for free, including the opening keynote (during which the company makes the bulk of its major I/O announcements).</p><p>Although I/O is primarily a conference for developers, it’s typically where we first learn about major upcoming Android changes, which of course affect tens of millions of people. Expect a lot of news about Google’s AI efforts as well, such as what’s next for Gemini.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="width:640px;height:773px;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">See you all at Google I/O starting May 19th! <a href="https://t.co/KgNKbb3nMu">https://t.co/KgNKbb3nMu</a> <a href="https://t.co/OD6x3IYtTi">pic.twitter.com/OD6x3IYtTi</a></p>— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/2023847540400288134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote>


</div><p>As has been the case for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-google-io-2019-may-7th.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">several years</a>, Google revealed the conference’s dates for 2026 after enough folks <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://io.google/2026/puzzle/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">completed a puzzle</a> on the I/O website. This year’s puzzle has multiple “builds” to play through, all of which use Gemini. </p><p>They start with a mini-golf game in which a virtual caddy that’s powered by Gemini offers some of the most anodyne advice imaginable. The second build is a nonogram. If you’ve ever played a Picross game, you’ll know what to do here. It’s about using logic to place tiles on a grid in order to create an image. Here, Google is using Gemini to generate “endless game boards.”</p><p>The other three minigames are Word Wheel (which “leverages Gemini 3 to automate level design”), Super Sonicbot (which “uses Gemini to introduce microphone mechanics where noise controls the Android Bot’s altitude”) and Stretchy Cat. The latter “uses Gemini 3 as a stage designer balancing game mechanics and difficulty to create endless play.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/google-io-2026-is-set-for-may-19-and-20-200805024.html?src=rss
