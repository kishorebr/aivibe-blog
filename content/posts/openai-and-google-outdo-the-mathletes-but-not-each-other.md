AI models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind achieved gold-medal scores in the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO), one of the world’s oldest and most challenging high school-level math competitions, the companies independently announced in recent days.

The results underscore just how fast AI systems are advancing, and yet, how evenly matched Google and OpenAI seem to be in the AI race. AI companies are competing fiercely for the public perception of being ahead in the AI race: an intangible battle of “vibes” that can have big implications for securing top AI talent. A lot of AI researchers come from backgrounds in competitive math, so benchmarks like IMO mean more than others.


	
	




	
	



Last year, Google scored a silver medal at IMO using a “formal” system, meaning it required humans to translate problems into a machine‑readable format. This year, both OpenAI and Google entered “informal” systems into the competition, which were able to ingest questions and generate proof‑based answers in natural language. Both companies claim their AI models correctly answered five out of six questions on IMO’s test, scoring higher than most high school students and Google’s AI model from last year, without requiring any human-machine translation.

In interviews with TechCrunch, researchers behind OpenAI and Google’s IMO efforts claimed that these gold-medal performances represent breakthroughs around AI reasoning models in non-verifiable domains. While AI reasoning models tend to do well on questions with straightforward answers, such as simple math or coding tasks, these systems struggle on tasks with more ambiguous solutions, such as buying a great chair or helping with complex research.

However, Google is raising questions around how OpenAI conducted and announced its gold-medal IMO performance. After all, if you’re going to enter AI models into a math contest for high schoolers, you might as well argue like teenagers.
