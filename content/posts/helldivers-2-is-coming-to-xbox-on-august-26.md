<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>, the third-person co-op shooter developed by Arrowhead Game Studios, is finally coming to Xbox on August 26. The sequel to the 2015 top-down shooter was released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in early 2024 and supports cross-platform play.</p>
<p>After launch, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a huge success, selling over 15 million copies and reaching 450,000 concurrent players on Steam, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/helldivers-2s-concurrent-steam-player-record-is-playstation-studios-highest-yet/">highest number ever</a> among PlayStation games released for the PC. In fact, there were so many players online that Sony <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-helldivers-2-163829512.html">briefly attempted to mandate</a> PlayStation Network account linking, which set off a wave of negative reviews from frustrated gamers. The policy was eventually reversed.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">announcement</a> of the game&#39;s Xbox launch, Game Director Mikael Eriksson said, “we know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p>
<p>This is a rare instance of a Sony-published game coming to Xbox systems, following the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mlb-the-show-24-features-women-ballplayers-for-the-first-time-160007024.html"><em>MLB: The Show</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>series<em>. </em>Time will tell if this is just another rare exception, or the start of a new trend by Sony allowing their <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-unlocks-regional-restrictions-for-some-pc-games-in-more-than-100-countries-162228948.html">games to reach more players</a>. Players can pre-order digital copies of both the standard edition and the Super Citizen Edition for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>now. It&#39;s unclear if a physical copy of the game will be released.</p>
<p><strong>Correction, July 3, 2025, 2:02PM ET:</strong> This story originally stated that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a first-party PlayStation game. While it was published by Sony Interactive, the company doesn&#39;t own Arrowhead.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-on-august-26-172937757.html?src=rss
