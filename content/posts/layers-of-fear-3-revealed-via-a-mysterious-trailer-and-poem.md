<p>Bloober Team has revealed <em>Layer of Fear 3</em> following a Valentine&#39;s Day countdown that started at the beginning of 2026. The new chapter will include not only a game but a novel and music, the company said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/446859-layers-of-fear-3-revealed-bloober-team-is-expanding-its-horror-multiverse-with-new-games-and-cross-media-content">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer revealed the new IP via a live-action teaser, with an actor reading lines from William Blake&#39;s poem, <em>The Sick Rose</em>. A painting then fell from the wall, and the actor then turned over an hourglass with red sand, with a tagline stating &quot;The door won&#39;t stay closed.&quot; No gameplay or other information like the release date was revealed.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What Bloober did say, though, is that it would launch new <em>Layer of Fear</em> non-game content, including a novel by horror writer, poet and vocalist Marta Bijan. The company also announced that it would release the soundtracks for <em>Layer of Fear,</em> <em>The Medium</em> and <em>Cronos</em> both in digital and physical (CD and vinyl) editions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new title is likely to be eagerly anticipated given Bloober&#39;s form of late. The company recently released its <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> and a new Switch 2 <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> version called <em>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</em>. The original <em>Layers of Fear</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-layers-of-fear-valentines-day-love-horror.html">came out back in 2016</a> and is considered one of the better horror titles of recent years, thanks to an expertly crafted narrative and psychedelic thrills and chills. The sequel moved to a creepy ocean liner and was equally well-received.</p>
<p><strong>Update Feb. 16, 2026 at 3:06PM ET</strong>: The headline was updated with the correct game name.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/layers-of-3-revealed-via-a-mysterious-trailer-and-poem-153021903.html?src=rss
