<p>The esports partnership between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Saudi Arabia is no more. On Thursday, the IOC <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-statement-on-the-olympic-esports-games">said</a> that it and the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee (SOPC) have &quot;mutually agreed&quot; to part ways. The breakup comes weeks after Saudi Arabia&#39;s sovereign wealth fund and other investors <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html">bought EA for $55 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The IOC and SOPC <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-olympic-esports-games-will-take-place-in-saudi-arabia-in-2025-154637804.html">agreed on a 12-year esports partnership</a> in 2024. At the time, the IOC was reportedly in talks with publishers of <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. The two sides discussed holding the Olympic Esports Games every two years. (The first games were initially scheduled for this year, but were pushed back to 2027.) Potential hosts for later installments were said to include South Korea and the US.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead, the two sides are now &quot;committed to pursuing their own esports ambitions on separate paths,&quot; according to the IOC. The organization now plans to &quot;spread the opportunities presented by the Olympic Esports Games more widely.&quot; It still wants the inaugural games to happen &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>AP</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ioc-saudi-arabia-esports-olympics-dd15c7f78f0442db30fbfd514c271df2">notes</a> that the dissolution comes seven months into Kristy Coventry&#39;s IOC presidency. We don&#39;t know the details of how the deal came apart. However, the IOC wants to connect with younger fans through esports, but in a way that &quot;Olympic values are respected.&quot; Saudi Arabia&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/geoguessr-pulls-out-of-the-esports-world-cup-after-a-community-protest-151138984.html">Esports World Cup</a> features <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-05-tracing-the-history-of-the-moba.html">MOBAs</a>, shooters and fighting games.</p>
<p>If the IOC wants to project a squeaky-clean image while connecting with young gamers, it may have an uphill battle. (For the record, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-07-video-game-violence-trump-meeting-esa-nra.html">games don&#39;t lead to violence</a>.)</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ioc-and-saudi-arabia-call-it-quits-on-their-olympic-esports-partnership-163148341.html?src=rss
