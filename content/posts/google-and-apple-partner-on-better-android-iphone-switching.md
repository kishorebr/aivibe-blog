<p>Google and Apple have long existed as polar opposites, each ruling over their tech kingdoms with little interest in cooperation. But the latest build of Android&#39;s Canary operating system hints at an unusual instance of collaboration between the brands, with a new feature that seems aimed at making data transfer simpler between Android and iOS mobile device during the setup phase. It is expected to also be available in a future developer beta of iOS 26.&nbsp;</p><p>A representative for Google confirmed that the report from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/08/android-iphone-switching/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>9to5Google</em></a> on this development is accurate, but didn&#39;t provide any additional details on how the transfer will work. Each brand already has their own dedicated Switch to Android and Switch to iOS apps for making the swap between ecosystems, but making the transition easier at the operating system level and adding support for moving more types of data certainly sounds promising. That said, features can go through a fair bit of iteration between the dev betas and the final launch, and Android Canary is a very early stage of development, so we&#39;ll be curious to see what actually arrives on our smartphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-and-apple-partner-on-better-android-iphone-switching-204738960.html?src=rss
