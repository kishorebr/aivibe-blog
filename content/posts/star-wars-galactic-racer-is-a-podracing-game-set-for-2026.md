It&#39;s scheduled to hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2026.</p>
<p>The action here is set after the fall of the Empire. With the galaxy in rebuild mode after dealing with that whole mess, an unsanctioned, underground racing circuit called the Galactic League comes into being in the Outer Rim. Here, according to the game&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">Steam page</a>, &quot;syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>is run-based, so if your podracer blows up, it might be game over. The action takes place across well-known Star Wars planets in addition to some new ones. The races have branching routes and you&#39;ll unlock new abilities on each run.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a story-driven, single-player campaign, as well as PvP modes. The vehicles are customizable too. Dig it.
