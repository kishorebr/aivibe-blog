Dot, an AI companion app that aimed to be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company announced on Friday. On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data. 

Launched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support. 


	
	




	
	



As Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said.

However, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup. 

As AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into delusional thinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon described as “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs. 

As Dot shuts down, AI chatbot apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns. OpenAI is currently being sued by the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other stories have highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general sent a letter to OpenAI over safety concerns.

Dot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged. 

“Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains
