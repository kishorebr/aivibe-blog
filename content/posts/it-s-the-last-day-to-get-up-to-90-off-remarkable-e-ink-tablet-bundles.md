<p>E Ink tablet maker reMarkable is running a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Remarkable;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1f7efcc9-4a08-437e-b0e7-e67043761cab&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=37b6fead-a9b3-44fd-8244-00ae1ade3bb9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Remarkable&amp;linkText=bundle+deal+right+now&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlbWFya2FibGUuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzdiNmZlYWQtYTliMy00NGZkLTgyNDQtMDBhZTFhZGUzYmI5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlbWFya2FibGUuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXWXx1ipaSjzVqEMROAyTHfBpItEJmY_pMSY6fk_uY7Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fremarkable.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://remarkable.com/">bundle deal right now</a> that can save you between $80 and $90 when buying a reMarkable 2 along with a Marker stylus and a folio case. The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio. The offer runs through January 17.</p> 
<p>The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best e-ink tablet</a>. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html">review</a>, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable.</p> 
<p>The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn&#39;t think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges.</p> 
<p>The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.</p>
