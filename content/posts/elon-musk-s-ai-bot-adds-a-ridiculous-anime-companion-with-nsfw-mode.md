<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>People who pay for access to SuperGrok can now try the AI chatbot’s new “Companions” avatars, xAI owner Elon Musk announced <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1944705383874146513">Monday morning</a>. The companions available currently include Ani, an anime avatar, and Rudy, a cartoony red panda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ani also has what <a href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/grok-debuts-interactive-ai-companions-on-ios-with-anime-avatars/"><em>TestingCatalog</em> describes</a> as an “NSFW” mode where the character wears lingerie. (And just a warning: if you search for posts about the characters on X, you’ll probably come across NSFW videos.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, users have to go into settings to turn on the companions, but “we will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1944818933305106810">Musk says</a>, describing this version <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1944818933305106810">as a “soft launch.”</a> Even though I’m a free user of Grok, when I opened the Grok app, I was able to talk to both avatars, so the characters may be more widely available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users have found that another AI character called “Chad” <a href="https://x.com/doganuraldesign/status/1944749965944738023">is in the works</a>. The app already has a voice mode where you can chat back and forth with a faceless version of Grok, and that has an NSFW toggle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The addition of the animated characters follows Grok posting antisemitism and Hitler praise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/701884/grok-antisemitic-hitler-posts-elon-musk-x-xai">last week</a>, which xAI said <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1943916977481036128">was due</a> to an “update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot.”</p>
