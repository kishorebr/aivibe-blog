<p>Originally announced as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-developer-game-freak-is-partnering-with-private-divison-on-a-new-action-franchise-200045467.html">"Project Bloom,"</a> Game Freak's upcoming action-adventure game made a formal appearance at the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/live-updates-from-the-xbox-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-200036748.html">Xbox Games Showcase</a> as <em>Beast of Reincarnation. </em>The studio describes the game as a "one-person, one-dog" RPG and it's supposed to be coming out in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on the trailer, the game is set in a post-apocalyptic Japan that's returned to nature due to some kind of beast-born blight. As the main character "Emma the Sealer," you'll travel through the wilderness, engaging in "demanding, technical combat" alongside your dog Koo, all in the hopes of "saving humanity" from the sickness that's plaguing the land.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pok√©mon games, but the developer has made an eclectic collection of other projects between mainline entries, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pocket-card-jockey-ride-on-switch/"><em>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!</em></a> and more recently, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://pando-land.com/en/index.html"><em>Pandoland</em></a>. "Project Bloom" was originally supposed to be published by Take-Two's Private Division label, but when <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">the label was sold in 2024</a>, Game Freak's game was taken up by a new publisher called Fictions.</p>
<p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2026. It'll also be available through Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-one-person-one-dog-rpg-launching-in-2026-192305237.html?src=rss
