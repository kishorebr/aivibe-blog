In an interview with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/SundayFutures/status/1939340102263521289"><em>Fox News</em></a>' Maria Bartiromo, the US president announced that there's a buyer secured for TikTok.</p>
<p>"We have a buyer for TikTok by the way," Trump said in the interview. "I think I'll need probably China approval and I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it." When asked to identify the buyer, Trump only cryptically revealed that it was a "group of very wealthy people," which would be announced in "about two weeks."</p>

<p>The uncertain fate of TikTok began when Trump signed an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-delays-tiktok-ban-for-at-least-75-days-via-executive-order-014523110.html">executive order</a> to extend a deadline to ban the app from US-based app stores. The initial extension came shortly after Trump took office for his second term in January and was later pushed back <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trump-is-extending-the-deadline-for-a-tiktok-deal-by-another-75-days-180526714.html">another 75 days</a> to April.

As the future of TikTok remains in a state of uncertainty, Trump said the extensions were "no big deal" during the interview with <em>Fox News</em>. More than 170 million active US users are awaiting a final decision on TikTok, which is developed by the Beijing-based ByteDance that's facing pressure to either sell its app or have it banned due to data privacy and "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/why-government-ban-tiktok.html">national security</a>" concerns.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trump-claims-a-very-wealthy-group-will-buy-tiktok-without-revealing-who-185126123.html?src=rss
