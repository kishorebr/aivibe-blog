<p>A renowned <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/apple/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Apple_Inc." data-original-link="">Apple</a> engineer who was instrumental in developing modern-day <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/computing/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Computing" data-original-link="">computing</a> has died. Bill Atkinson, who was part of Apple&#39;s original Macintosh development team, died of pancreatic cancer at 74, according to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10238073579963378&amp;id=1378467145&amp;_rdr">Facebook post</a> made by his family on June 5.</p>
<p>His contributions to Apple and the Macintosh personal computer are still widely used today, including fundamental UI elements like the menu bar, double-clicking and the selection lasso. However, Atkinson&#39;s work goes much deeper than that, since he&#39;s partly responsible for the foundational design language that influenced Apple&#39;s early days. His legacy includes creating MacPaint, an application that showed the world what a graphics-based system looks like at a time when text-based systems were the norm, and developing QuickDraw, a graphics toolbox that the Macintosh and Lisa computers use. To make computers more user-friendly, Atkinson also designed HyperCard, an Apple application that introduced hypertext to everyday users and not just programmers. Tim Cook paid tribute to Atkinson, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1931509329125158978">posting on X</a>, that he was a “true visionary whose creativity, heart, and groundbreaking work on the Mac will forever inspire us.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond Apple, Atkinson was one of three co-founders for General Magic, a software and electronics company that supplied products to Motorola and Sony in the 90s. Later, he worked with Numenta in 2007, which was a startup focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Artificial_intelligence" data-original-link="">artificial intelligence</a>. Atkinson was also a seasoned nature photographer, publishing a book called <em>Within the Stone</em> that highlights polished and cut rocks with close-up shots. Atkinson is survived by his wife, two daughters, stepson, stepdaughter, two brothers, four sisters, and dog, Poppy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/influential-apple-engineer-bill-atkinson-dies-at-74-191024913.html?src=rss
