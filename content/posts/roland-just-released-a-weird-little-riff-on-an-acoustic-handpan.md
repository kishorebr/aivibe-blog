<p>Synthesizer giant Roland just announced a fairly bizarre contraption. The Mood Pan is the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.roland.com/global/products/mood_pan_mn-10/">digital take on an acoustic handpan</a>. For the uninitiated, a handpan is a version of the steelpan instrument that&#39;s been popular in Trinidad and Tobago since the 1930s. It&#39;s widely considered to be the only truly new acoustic instrument <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.un.org/ungifts/steel-pans">invented in the 20th century</a>.</p>
<p>However, handpans and steelpans take serious skill to play. Roland&#39;s Mood Pan is much easier to play, thanks to clearly visible pads that represent notes. These nine pads can be set to different musical scales, making it impossible to hit a wrong note. The company says that this simpler design requires &quot;no previous musical skills.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a built-in 2.1 speaker system and a Bluetooth receiver, which lets users stream audio from external sources. The sound engine offers &quot;tranquil tones,&quot; with multiple sound variations and effects.</p>
<p>The Mood Pan allows access to a number of different percussive instruments like the tongue drum, gamelan, crystal bowl and singing bowl, along with unique tunings. It can also emulate stuff like sitars, orchestral strings and synth pads. There&#39;s an affiliated app for changing up sounds and for fine-tuning pad sensitivity.</p>
<p>It&#39;s played with finger taps, just like many of its acoustic cousins. The instrument is small enough to be placed directly on a lap, though also works on a table. Roland claims this is the perfect gadget for &quot;musical exploration, relaxation and meditation.&quot; As for those last two, the Mood Pan can play built-in environmental music and nature sounds. The company says these modes are for &quot;mornings, evenings, relaxing and yoga sessions.&quot;</p>

<p>This being a modern digital instrument, there&#39;s a USB-C MIDI port for triggering sounds on computers or via other gadgets. It&#39;s powered by six AA batteries or via USB-C connection. The instrument is available to order right now, but shipments won&#39;t be going out for a few weeks. The Mood Pan costs $660.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/roland-just-released-a-weird-little-riff-on-an-acoustic-handpan-180051436.html?src=rss
