<p>A Google support page in Hindi says the ability to change your Gmail address is on the way. The feature would allow you to replace your current @<a target="_blank" class="link">gmail.com</a> address with another. Your old address would remain active as an alias on the account, and all your data would stick around, unaffected.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">support page</a> (translated) says that &quot;the ability to change your Google Account email address is gradually rolling out to all users.&quot; The change was first spotted on a Google Pixel <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">forum</a> on Telegram and was first reported in the press by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/24/google-change-gmail-addresses/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>9to5Google</em></a>.</p><p>Google hasn&#39;t made a formal announcement about the change. The English version of the support page still says you usually can&#39;t change your @<a target="_blank" class="link">gmail.com</a> address. Up to this point, Google has only allowed address changes for <a target="_blank" class="link">non-gmail.com</a> addresses.</p><p>Engadget reached out to Google for confirmation. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.</p><p>When the feature (presumably) rolls out broadly, you&#39;ll change it through your account settings. Sign in to your Google account, then go to <strong>Manage your Google account &gt; Personal info &gt; Google Account email</strong>. If you don&#39;t see the option to change it, then you&#39;ll have to wait.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/you-may-soon-be-able-to-change-your-gmail-address-165633905.html?src=rss
