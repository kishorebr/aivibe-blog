<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI has scrubbed mentions of io, the hardware startup co-founded by famous Apple designer Jony Ive, from its website and social media channels. The sudden change closely follows their recent announcement of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">OpenAI&#8217;s nearly $6.5 billion acquisition</a> and plans to create dedicated AI hardware.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI tells <em>The Verge</em> the deal is still happening, but it scrubbed mentions due to a trademark lawsuit from Iyo, the hearing device startup spun out of Google&#8217;s moonshot factory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The announcement blog post and a nine-minute video featuring Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are no longer available. The blog post from Ive and Altman announcing the deal said, &#8220;The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name &#8216;io.&#8217; We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.</p>
