<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">DirecTV will begin replacing your TV&#39;s screensaver with AI-generated ads thanks to a new partnership. The entertainment brand is working with Glance, an AI company that has received backing from Google and developed an on-device AI tool alongside the tech giant. The new AI-powered screensavers will begin rolling out to DirecTV Gemini devices early next year.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Glance&#39;s </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/glance-to-deliver-new-immersive-content-experiences-to-streaming-on-directv-302582769.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">press release</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> about the deal presents the tech&#39;s capability in lofty language: &quot;Shop smarter by discovering and engaging with products and brands in an AI-led virtual and visually immersive shopping experience that feels native to TV.&quot; In practice, however, it sounds like a viewer can use the Glance mobile app to do things like insert themselves or other people into AI-generated videos appearing on their televisions. Then they can use the voice remote to alter the person&#39;s wardrobe and then buy items similar to the AI-generated images from your phone. </span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">&quot;We are making television a lean-in experience versus lean back,&quot; Rajat Wanchoo, Glance&#39;s group vice president of commercial partnerships, told </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798174/directv-glance-ai-shoppable-screensavers" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>The Verge</em></span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which initially picked up news of the partnership. &quot;We want to give users a chance to use the advancements that have happened in generative AI to create a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but on TV.&quot;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It&#39;s unclear how many DirecTV customers want to have a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but questions about whether people want or need a feature hasn&#39;t stopped most AI companies from pushing ahead with business plans. The press release doesn&#39;t note whether viewers will be able to turn off this screensaver feature once it&#39;s live.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/directv-will-start-replacing-screensavers-with-ai-generated-ads-next-year-224436035.html?src=rss
