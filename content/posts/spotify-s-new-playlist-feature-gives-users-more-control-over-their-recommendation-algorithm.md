<p>Spotify is attempting to give users more control over the music the streaming service recommends with a new playlist feature called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-10/spotify-prompted-playlists-algorithm-gustav-soderstrom/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">&quot;Prompted Playlist.&quot;</a> The beta feature is rolling out in New Zealand starting on December 11, and will let users write a custom prompt that Spotify can use — alongside their listening history — to create a playlist of new music.</p><p>By tapping on Prompted Playlist, Spotify subscribers participating in the beta will be presented with a prompt field where they can type exactly what they want to hear and how they want Spotify&#39;s algorithm to respond. And while past AI features took users&#39; individual taste into consideration, Spotify claims Prompted Playlist &quot;taps into your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Prompted-Playlist-GIF-102924.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Prompted-Playlist-GIF-102924.gif" style="height:606px;width:1080px;" alt="A gif showing how users will create a new Prompted Playlist." data-uuid="281d5630-2906-453e-bfc9-9162f18833f5"/><figcaption>Prompted Playlist will exist alongside Spotify&#39;s other playlist features.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure><p>Prompts can be as broad or specific as users want, and Spotify says playlists can also be set to automatically update with new songs on a specific cadence. An &quot;Ideas&quot; tab in the Prompted Playlist setup screen can provide suggestions for users who need inspiration for their prompt. And interestingly, Spotify says each song in the playlist will be presented with a short description explaining why the algorithm chose it, which could help direct future fine-tuning.</p><p>If this all sounds familiar, it&#39;s because Spotify has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotifys-ai-playlists-are-now-available-for-premium-users-in-the-us-130008423.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">already tried AI-generated playlists</a> in the past. The difference here, besides Spotify framing the new feature as giving users more &quot;control,&quot; is the detail of the prompts, the depth of user data Spotify is applying and the options users will have to keep playlists up-to-date. Prompted Playlist is only available in English for now, but Spotify says the feature will evolve as it adds more users.</p><p>Spotify isn&#39;t the first company to offer users more direct control over how content is recommended to them. Meta has recently started experimenting with algorithm-tuning options in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/your-dear-algo-threads-posts-might-actually-do-something-soon-215448062.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Threads</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-will-let-you-control-which-topics-its-algorithm-recommends-133002612.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Instagram</a>, and TikTok lets users <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-for-you-feed-refresh-130028273.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">completely reset their For You page</a> to start fresh. The irony of all these features is that algorithm-driven feeds were supposed to be able to recommend good music, posts and videos without additional prompting. Now that prompting is being pitched as a feature, rather than extra work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-new-playlist-feature-gives-users-more-control-over-their-recommendation-algorithm-203237903.html?src=rss
