<p>Lego has a long history of geek and gaming crossovers. We&#39;ve seen recent sets for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-lego-ultimate-death-star-set-includes-over-9000-pieces-and-costs-1000-183556661.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Star Wars</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/legos-star-trek-uss-enterprise-set-arrives-on-black-friday-173414532.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Star Trek</em></a>, while past collaborations include everything from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-super-mario-starter-course-expansion-sets-review-090021993.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Super Mario Bros.</em></a> to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-19-lego-minecraft-cave-farm.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Minecraft</em></a>. The latest blocky tie-in is a classic: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, as teased on social network X by Nintendo of America with the caption “Do you realize who you’re dealing with?”</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🔥Do you realize who you&#39;re dealing with?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOTheLegendofZelda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOTheLegendofZelda</a> <a href="https://t.co/NCl84ydZ3a">pic.twitter.com/NCl84ydZ3a</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988267657133687158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote>

(Presumably Lego Navi will not interrupt you with &quot;Hey! Listen!&quot; every five minutes, but maybe the company is striving for total accuracy.) A blurry Zelda minifig stands behind them, and the heroes stare upward at the looming shadow of what must be a Ganon character. Whether the villain is a minifig of his own or a larger-than-life constructed model remains to be seen. The set won&#39;t be released until 2026, but most likely either Lego or Nintendo will reveal more details ahead of the launch date.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Hyrule is getting the Lego treatment.
