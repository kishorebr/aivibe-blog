<p>We've been getting a real kick out of the offbeat cable TV parody that is <em>Blippo+,</em> which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-fulcrum-defender-dig-dig-dino-and-blippo-140036697.html">arrived with Playdate's Season Two</a>, and now it's looking like non-Playdate owners will be able to experience the strangeness too later this year. Panic, along with Telefantasy Studios, Noble Robot and the artists Yacht, announced at the PC Gaming Show that <em>Blippo+</em> is coming to PC and Nintendo Switch in fall 2025. And unlike the 1-bit black and white programs we've been tuning into on the Playdate, it'll all be in color.</p>
<p><em>Blippo+</em> features a roster of live-action programs that may or may not be alien transmissions, plus a forum called Femtofax that brings you even deeper into the unusual goings-on of the Blippians. Panic revealed with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-the-whiteout-and-wheelsprung-130014285.html">the second week of Season Two games</a> that <em>Blippo+</em> wouldn't just be a one-off release, but would instead get weekly content updates every week for the next eleven weeks. When it lands on the other platforms, <em>Blippo+</em> will have "a time-hopping mechanic so viewers can travel back and forth through weeks of TV programming without losing the magic of 'non-demand' linear viewing."</p>

<p>It's absurd, it's nostalgic — <em>Blippo+</em> was made with vintage analog broadcast equipment, according to the creators — and it's totally unpredictable. You really never know what madness it's going to serve up next, and it's great. In color, things are only going to get weirder.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2s-blippo-tv-simulator-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and-pc-in-color-this-fall-230149046.html?src=rss
