<p>Ring aired a Super Bowl ad touting its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets"><ins>Search Party feature</ins></a> that didn&#39;t quite get the intended buzz. Instead, the commercial <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/qasimrashid.com/post/3megx6p7p7226">scared the pants off</a> of anyone <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://petapixel.com/2026/02/09/people-are-freaked-out-by-the-ring-doorbell-camera-super-bowl-ad/"><ins>concerned about a mass surveillance state</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The feature is advertised as a way to reunite missing dogs with their owners, a noble cause indeed, but Search Party does this by turning individual Ring devices into a surveillance network. Each camera uses AI to identify pets running across its field of vision and all feeds are pooled together to potentially identify lost animals. I&#39;ve never seen a slope quite so slippery, as the technology could easily be rejiggered to track people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that this isn&#39;t a new feature. Search Party was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ceo-ring-search-party-ad-pet-finder-99-dogs-2026-2"><ins>first announced last year</ins></a>. In that time it has been used to find 99 lost dogs in 90 days of use, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Approximately ten million pets go missing in America each year. Many people aren&#39;t keen on helping to create a surveillance state for a tool with what looks to be around a 0.005 percent success rate. That percentage is sure to rise with mass adoption, but you get the jist.</p>
<p>With that said, many Ring users are looking for a way to disable the feature, as it&#39;s enabled by default. Engadget has got you covered.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this is fairly easy to do. Just open the Ring app and tap the menu in the top-left corner. Next, select Control Center. Then, tap Search Party and toggle the settings to Disable for both Search for Lost Pets and Natural Hazards. Repeat this process for each camera.</p>
