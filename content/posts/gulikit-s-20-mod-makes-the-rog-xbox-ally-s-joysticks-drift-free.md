<p>There may not be any reports of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-says-the-switch-2-joy-cons-dont-have-hall-effect-thumbsticks-for-reducing-stick-drift-145541325.html">stick drift</a> with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">ROG Xbox Ally</a> yet, but that doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be. If you&#39;d rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/3586643.html">TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules</a> made specifically for your Xbox handheld.</p>
<p>GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X&#39;s stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1363656.html">joystick upgrade kit</a> for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient. GuliKit even made the joystick upgrades easy to install since there&#39;s no soldering required, and you can fine-tune the calibration in the handheld&#39;s system settings.</p>

GuliKit&#39;s joystick upgrade is already available to US customers on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ROG-Xbox-Ally-Electromagnetic-Thumbstick-Replacement/dp/B0G4QW8798">Amazon storefront</a> for $19.99.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/gulikits-20-mod-makes-the-rog-xbox-allys-joysticks-drift-free-190521030.html?src=rss
