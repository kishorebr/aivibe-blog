<p>Apple shared its latest quarterly financial results today and the <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">news</a> is once again very, very good for the Cupertino company. The quarter ending December 27, 2025 marked &quot;the best-ever quarter&quot; for iPhones, which generated a record high revenue of nearly $85.27 billion for the business. Apple doesn&#39;t disclose the number of devices sold any more, but even with the prices for many of its latest generation of smartphones surpassing $1,000 a pop, that&#39;s still got to be a heck of a lot of iPhones.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The demand for iPhone was simply staggering,&quot; CEO Tim Cook said on the conference call to discuss the results. &quot;This is the strongest iPhone lineup we&#39;ve ever had and by far the most popular.&quot;</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only massive number in the earnings report. Services revenue also logged its biggest quarter yet, growing 14 percent over the same period last year to reach just over $30 billion. It was also Apple&#39;s biggest quarter to date for total revenue, which was nearly $143.76 billion for the already fabulously wealthy company.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-reported-its-best-ever-quarter-for-iphone-sales-234135513.html?src=rss
