<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. As a reminder, the latest edition of Steam Next Fest runs from February 23 until March 2, during which you&#39;ll be able to check out demos for hundreds of upcoming games. A bunch are available already, including one for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/denshattack-is-a-blend-of-tony-hawk-trains-and-shonen-anime-174106792.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Denshattack!</em></a>, which I definitely recommend <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">checking out</a>. As it turns out, doing Tony Hawk Pro Skater-style tricks with a high-speed Japanese train absolutely rips.</p><p>On Thursday, there were four showcases highlighting indie games all in a single day. It&#39;s not exactly feasible for me to recap them in full here, unfortunately, but I can at least tell you about a few of the many highlights.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sn2h3q5YruA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The Black History Month edition of the Black Voices in Gaming Showcase includes trailers and interviews for some games that are already available, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/highguard-a-hyperpop-arena-shooter-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000874.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em></a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-the-witcher-3-are-coming-to-game-pass-163624685.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Aerial_Knight&#39;s DropShot</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heist-game-relooted-gets-a-release-date-173456541.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Relooted</em></a>.<em> </em>Of course, the stream featured plenty of games that are on the way too.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3121890/Erased/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Erased</em></a>, from solo developer Jerron Jacques, looks pretty interesting. It&#39;s an open-world fighting game that takes place in a cyberpunk setting with dance battles, parkour, pets, strange creatures and much more. Jacques, who has been documenting the game&#39;s development process on social media, even <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUHn8JHDNJW/?hl=en" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">carried out</a> some of the parkour motion capture work personally.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRPk20eR848?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>There was lots of good stuff in this week&#39;s Convergence Showcase too, including another peek at <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire </em>as we get to see one of the game&#39;s bosses for the first time. This first-person shooter with rubber-hose animation is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mouse-pi-for-hire-arrives-in-march-2026-195454228.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">set to arrive on March 19</a>.</p><p>There were other welcome announcements for me in this showcase. First, there was a release date for the Zelda-inspired adventure <em>Gecko Gods</em>. I&#39;ve had this on my wishlist <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sports-story-nintendo-switch-eshop-184541324.html/1000" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">since 2022</a>, so I&#39;m glad to learn it&#39;ll hit Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on April 16.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, record shop sim <em>Wax Heads</em> (which probably should have been called Low Fidelity, tbh) is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on May 5. You can check out a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769240/Wax_Heads/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Steam Next Fest demo</a> for that one now.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sJnQ6njC0w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The second edition of Indie Fan Fest had a trove of goodies as well. For one thing, <em>Balatro </em>publisher Playstack could be about to cause another mass reduction in collective productivity with <em>Raccoin</em>, which now has a release date of March 31. This is another roguelike deckbuilder, but this time it&#39;s in the form of a coin pusher. I didn&#39;t have a chance to check out the previous playtest to get a better sense of why there&#39;s so much buzz around this one, but I&#39;ll for sure be trying the Steam Next Fest demo, which is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">available now</a>.</p><p>It remains deeply weird to refer to a game under Acclaim&#39;s umbrella as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cozy-detectives-urban-disc-golf-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110029695.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">an indie</a>, but that&#39;s where we are now. The publisher is bringing Ridiculous Games&#39; <em>GridBeat</em> to Nintendo Switch and Steam on March 26. This is a rhythm-based dungeon crawler in which you (a hacker) try to escape from a corporate network after pilfering valuable data. There&#39;s a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Next Fest demo available</a> for this one too.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, a narrower release window for Japanese convenience store sim <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/old-school-platforming-metroidvania-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000751.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1"><em>InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories</em></a> was revealed. It&#39;s coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2723430/inKONBINI_One_Store_Many_Stories/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Steam</a>, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox in April.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrrrQSk8TDk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Alongside a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quebec2026?tab=1" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">related sale on Steam</a>, the first Quebec Games Celebration Showcase took place on Thursday. It&#39;s always neat to learn about games being made in my neck of the woods.</p><p>One of those is <em>Surfpunk</em>, a co-op action RPG that looks a bit like <em>Hades </em>with surfing. Radical. You&#39;ll venture to procedurally generated islands in search of loot. There are four weapon classes to choose from and gadgets you can craft after collecting resources on your run. There&#39;s an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434830/Surfpunk/" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">updated Steam demo</a> that&#39;s said to have around five hours of gameplay. <em>Surfpunk </em>(which is from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/convergence-a-league-of-legends-story-will-arrive-on-may-23rd-165600767.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1"><em>Convergence: A League of Legends Story</em></a> developer Double Stallion) will arrive later this year.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFj07xnArBQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;m including this <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4408590/Croak_Demo/" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">demo announcement</a> trailer for <em>Croak</em>, a precision platformer from Woodrunner Games that appears to be heavily inspired by the likes of Celeste, separately for one main reason. You <em>have </em>to check out the studio&#39;s head of &quot;barketing.&quot; (Okay okay, the game&#39;s hand-drawn visuals look lovely too.)</p><p>There&#39;s plenty of other interesting stuff in the Quebec Games Celebration Showcase, including another look at <em>Tears of Metal </em>from Paper Cult Games, the studio behind the very enjoyable <em>Bloodroots</em>. There&#39;s a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1913120/Tears_of_Metal/" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">Steam demo</a> available for the hack-and-slash roguelite, which should be out this spring. Gothic sci-fi Metroidvania <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742920/Silent_Planet__Elegy_of_a_Dying_World/" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1"><em>Silent Planet</em></a> looks quite tasty too.</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGT63IjWyqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Under The Island </em>looks and sounds very <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>-coded. But since that&#39;s my favorite game of all time, I am not complaining. I love that protagonist Nia appears to use a hockey stick as a weapon too.&nbsp;</p><p>This action PRG from Slime King Games (and co-publishers Top Hat Studios and Doyoyo Games) has debuted to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/under-the-island/" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">strong early reviews</a>.

As novice skateboarder Lux, you&#39;ll try to take down the Skate Bums, a gang of bullies. There are &quot;weird characters,&quot; sick combos to pull off, coins to collect and wrecking balls to dodge.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s said to be a &quot;simple directional trick system&quot; while each run is apparently short. That seems ideal for quick, pick-up-and-play sessions on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. I also just really like the title. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/skate-bums-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1"><em>Skate Bums</em></a><em>, </em>which is from Lucky Last Studio, will normally cost $15 but there&#39;s a 15 percent discount until February 27.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ji3RdO-OhYM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Love Eternal </em>is a psychological &quot;horror platformer about escaping the domain of a selfish god,&quot; which is a strong pitch from developer brlka and <em>Demonschool </em>publisher Ysbryd Games. You&#39;ll need to flip between different gravitational pulls as you navigate this precision platformer, which follows teenager Maya on her attempt to return to her own reality.&nbsp;</p><p>During a dinner at home, Maya&#39;s family disappears and she suddenly appears in an &quot;eerie, desolate realm&quot; that looks like an Iron Age castle. That&#39;s a creepy enough set up to match the game&#39;s haunting atmosphere. <em>Love Eternal </em>is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/" data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2251-CUSA52815_00-0631046602862782" data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1">PS4</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013641" data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1">PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ca95510e-a218-4436-8d35-bec59f643ffa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+One%2C+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9sb3ZlLWV0ZXJuYWwvOW5kOHRiaHR3azcyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjYTk1NTEwZS1hMjE4LTQ0MzYtOGQzNS1iZWM1OWY2NDNmZmEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2xvdmUtZXRlcm5hbC85bmQ4dGJodHdrNzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWlWQDikZBqdCrEqZKH0kn--RI3pHFVhhri5EOpOpCFx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Flove-eternal%2F9nd8tbhtwk72" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:32;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/love-eternal/9nd8tbhtwk72">Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/love-eternal-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1">Nintendo Switch</a> for $10.

Along the way, Cadence and her buds will have to overcome enemies in battles that have turn-based and rhythm-based elements.</p><p>I mostly enjoyed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-2-slot-machine-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000884.html" data-i13n="cpos:41;pos:1">playing through a preview</a> several months ago, though I had to grit my teeth through the turn-based combat, which is not something I enjoy as a rule. However, Iridium Studios will allow players to turn off elements like that and environmental puzzles so more people who might have otherwise been turned off can enjoy <em>People of Note</em>. You can sample the game now on Steam via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626170/People_of_Note/" data-i13n="cpos:42;pos:1">a 90-minute Next Fest demo</a>.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSxuuoYkR3o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I don&#39;t fully understand what&#39;s going on in the reveal trailer for <em>Titanium Court</em>, which is from AP Thomson (a solo developer who previously worked on <em>Consume Me</em>) and publisher Fellow Traveller. Even the press release notes that it&#39;s &quot;impossibly difficult to describe.&quot; But it has an absorbing trailer soundtracked by an odd, Bill Callahan-esque song and it has already picked up <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://igf.com/article/baby-steps-strolls-to-lead-with-5-nominations-at-2026-igf-awards/" data-i13n="cpos:43;pos:1">several IGF award nominations</a>, so I&#39;m intrigued.</p><p>What I am able to surmise is that it&#39;s a surrealist, roguelike strategy game with match-three, auto battle and tower defense elements. It&#39;s also for &quot;clowns and criminals,&quot; apparently. I&#39;m gonna have to give the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/" data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1">Steam Next Fest demo</a> a shot to try to get my head around it. <em>Titanium Court </em>is coming to Steam “imminently.”</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4Pjyfs6IQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Sometimes, a game pops up that makes me think &quot;how has no one done this before?&quot; Such is the case with <em>Become</em>. It&#39;s a third-person linear adventure from solo developer&nbsp;Valentin Wirth in which you take on the guise of a single sperm. You can probably guess what the goal is.</p><p>The game has &quot;no explicit sexual acts, nudity or violence,&quot; according to its Steam page, though you will encounter some danger along your journey. You can upgrade your bespectacled spermatozoon via skill trees and seemingly adorn various pieces of headgear. <em>Become </em>is slated to hit <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710850/Become/" data-i13n="cpos:45;pos:1">Steam</a> later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-old-school-zelda-like-skate-bums-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000770.html?src=rss
