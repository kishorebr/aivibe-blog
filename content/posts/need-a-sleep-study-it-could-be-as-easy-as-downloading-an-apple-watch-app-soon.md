    Need a sleep study? It could be as easy as downloading an Apple Watch app soon
     
    BIDSleep, an app developed using the Apple Watch Series 6, aims to monitor sleep disorders - without the hassle of a sleep study.

BIDSleep uses an Apple Watch, which Dutta says the team included for its accessibility. Dutta said she envisions that researchers will eventually use this app to monitor people with sleep disorders outside of a lab. The study for the app was conducted with 47 adults who wore the Apple Watch Series 6 and a Dreem 2 Headband over seven nights for sleep monitoring and stage assessment. Also: I tested the e-paper smartwatch that got the internet buzzing - and don't want to take it offThe BIDSleep app collects instantaneous heart rate data as a person progresses through their sleep stages and feeds it into the researchers' AI model. In this study, the results mirrored those of EEG-based sleep staging -- the gold standard -- and accurately identified the correct sleep stage around 70% of the time
