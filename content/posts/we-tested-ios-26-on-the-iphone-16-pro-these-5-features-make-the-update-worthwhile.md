Now that it's finally available for everyone to test, you may be wondering if it's worth diving straight into or waiting for the official software launch -- likely sometime in September. That's what we're here to answer.Also: You can download iOS 26 public beta right now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)To set the stage, Apple's iOS 26 offers a refreshing new look, more streamlined first-party app layouts, more functionalities across popular services, and some smaller Easter egg features that greatly enhance your iPhone's usability.

Compared to competing multimodal tools on other phones, the feature was noticeably barebones. However, I found myself using it more often on iOS 26, thanks to the ability to better process on-screen information and follow up with relevant tasks. Specifically, being able to add a calendar event from my email has been a blessing.
