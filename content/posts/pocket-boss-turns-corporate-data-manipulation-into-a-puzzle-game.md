<p>There&#39;s a new puzzle game in town, and this one tackles remote work and corporate data manipulation. <em>Pocket Boss</em> is coming to Steam and the developers just dropped a trailer during the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-day-of-the-devs-at-summer-game-fest-2025-150047219.html">Day of the Devs showcase event</a>, which is part of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-schedule-announcements-new-games-and-everything-else-to-expect-183538568.html">Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>
<p><em>Pocket Boss</em> casts players as an employee working remotely, trapped by the whims of an ever-demanding boss. The game is primarily set inside of a chat window, though the puzzle element kicks in when the aforementioned job creator demands changes to data in order to maximize profits and erase competitors.</p>

<p>When that happens, the perspective shifts to a minigame. There looks to be plenty of different designs here. One game involves flinging a competitor&#39;s market share off of the screen, while another has players navigate a physical representation of the stock market without crashing. It&#39;s like a corporation-soaked take on the WarioWare franchise.</p>
<p>The game is published by Playables, which is the studio behind the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/time-flies-hands-on-summer-game-fest-day-devs-140056653.html">novel-looking <em>Time Flies</em></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://playkids.ch/">interactive cartoon <em>KIDS</em></a>. We don&#39;t have a release date for <em>Pocket Boss</em> just yet.</p>

<p>Of course, this is just one game announced during the beefy Day of the Devs stream, and that&#39;s just one event of many throughout <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a>. It&#39;s a good time to be someone who likes to read and watch trailers about upcoming video games.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/pocket-boss-turns-corporate-data-manipulation-into-a-puzzle-game-000042457.html?src=rss
