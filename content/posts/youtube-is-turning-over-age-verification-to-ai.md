<p>YouTube will start using machine learning to determine whether viewers should be on a teen account. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/extending-our-built-in-protections-to-more-teens-on-youtube/"><ins>said</ins></a> it plans to start using this AI application on a subset of US users in the coming weeks for a trial before rolling it out to the rest of the market. The tool will assess user behaviors including the types of videos being searched for, the categories of videos watched and how long the account has existed. When an account is deemed by machine learning to belong to a teen, YouTube will disable personalized advertising, activate digital wellbeing tools and add other safeguards for its younger users.</p>

The company noted that it has been using this machine learning approach &quot;in other markets for some time, where it is working well.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube isn&#39;t the only service to leverage an AI tool to catch users who might be lying about their age. However, it&#39;s putting the burden of correcting false positives on its users: &quot;If the system incorrectly estimates a user to be under 18, they will have the option to verify that they are 18 or over, such as using a credit card or a government ID.&quot; Meta has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-using-its-ai-age-detection-tech-to-shuffle-more-young-users-into-teen-accounts-142014188.html"><ins>a similar tool</ins></a> it began rolling out across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger earlier this year, but it lets people simply change their settings if the AI tool incorrectly guesses their age.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-is-turning-over-age-verification-to-ai-185634150.html?src=rss
