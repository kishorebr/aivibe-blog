<p>Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta&#39;s ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.</p><p>Under the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mattnavarra/post/DSXCACNirEt?xmt=AQF0RFIeIUKauwYgaXm8z0zs0jD3qmZqDZnvscsBxLvu0g" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shared by</a> social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that &quot;certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" style="height:1372px;width:1170px;" alt="Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test." data-uuid="360a7da6-7fb6-4f06-a787-bb206515c17e"><figcaption>Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using &quot;professional mode&quot; on Facebook. Publishers aren&#39;t affected for now. &quot;This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>While Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it&#39;s a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/meta-verified-creators" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">starts at</a> $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular. </p><p><strong><em>Have a tip for Karissa?
