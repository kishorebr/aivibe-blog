<p>Google is asking the Supreme Court to step in and pause the ruling the company received in its lawsuit with Epic Games, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/923271502/Google-SCOTUS-Stay-Application-9-24-25-Final">a filing</a> the company shared with Engadget. The company is making its request following <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-has-to-open-up-the-play-store-in-epic-games-antitrust-ruling-195239228.html">a major legal loss to Epic Games</a> in October 2024, which required it to open the Google Play Store to third-party app stores for a period of three years.</p>
<p>Google is asking the justices to intervene by October 17, three days before the injunction Epic won starts to go into effect. The company hopes that after offering a stay, the Court will take up the case for a full review. Asking the Supreme Court for relief wouldn&#39;t have even entered the picture if Google&#39;s appeal hadn&#39;t already been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-lost-its-antitrust-case-with-epic-again-190633325.html"><ins>denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</ins></a>. The company&#39;s filing includes multiple technical reasons why the Ninth Circuit Court&#39;s ruling should be overturned. It also offers several examples why the original injunction Epic won is bad for Google, developers and consumers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google believes the injunction &quot;[creates] enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive or pirated content to proliferate,‚Äù and that it burdens developers with &quot;constantly monitoring dozens or hundreds of stores that might suddenly carry their apps without their knowledge.&quot; The company also notes that the injunction will make it &quot;substantially easier for developers to avoid compensating Google,&quot; for Play Store services that have nothing to do with payments.</p>
<p>On the losing end of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-google-play-lawsuit-035741548.html">four-year legal battle</a> with <em>Fortnite</em> developer Epic, Google wasn&#39;t just ordered to open up the Play Store to third-party app stores, it&#39;s also no longer allowed to make deals around pre-installing the Play Store on phones or force developers to use its billing system. In contrast to Epic&#39;s case with Apple, where the developer only won <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">a small, if meaningful concession</a>, Google&#39;s loss gave Epic nearly everything it asked for.</p>
<p>When both Apple and Google asked the Supreme Court to review their case last year, the court <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/supreme-court-declines-appeals-from-apple-and-epic-games-in-app-store-case-192755323.html">denied their requests</a> without explanation. It&#39;s not clear if Google will get what it wants, but given the much larger changes it&#39;ll be forced to make if the injunction moves forward, it&#39;s possible the court could respond differently.</p>
