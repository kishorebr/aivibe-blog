<p>Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Wednesday in a high-profile jury trial over social media addiction. In an appearance that was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/zuckerberg-combative-during-initial-testimony-at-social-media-addiction-trial-257921093912" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">described by</a> <em>NBC News</em> as &quot;combative,&quot; the Facebook founder reportedly said that Meta&#39;s goal was to make Instagram &quot;useful&quot; not increase the time users are spending in the app.&nbsp;</p><p>On the stand, Zuckerberg was questioned about a company document that said improving engagement was among &quot;company goals,&quot; according to<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d858f427-cf69-4b7f-9b3a-ebd5796b93d8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzE4L21ldGEtbWFyay16dWNrZXJiZXJnLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1zYWZldHktdHJpYWwuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDg1OGY0MjctY2Y2OS00YjdmLTliM2EtZWJkNTc5NmI5M2Q4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzE4L21ldGEtbWFyay16dWNrZXJiZXJnLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1zYWZldHktdHJpYWwuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQw4id3Js9LtBoG4HYveIIwZvXQsSYp6FFcSMj_L9oGQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fmeta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-safety-trial.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-safety-trial.html"><em> CNBC</em></a>.  But Zuckerberg claimed that the company had &quot;made the conscious decision to move away from those goals, focusing instead on utility,&quot; according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>The Associated Press</em></a>. &quot;If something is valuable, people will use it more because it’s useful to them,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The trial stems from a lawsuit brought by a California woman identified as &quot;KGM&quot; in court documents. The now 20-year-old alleges that she was harmed as a child by addictive features in Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok.

As <em>CNBC</em> notes, members of Zuckerberg&#39;s entourage <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/meghanncuniff.bsky.social/post/3mf5jrkrp4k22" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">were spotted</a> wearing Meta&#39;s smart glasses as the CEO was escorted into the courthouse. It&#39;s unclear if anyone was actually using the glasses in court, but legal affairs journalist <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/meghanncuniff.bsky.social/post/3mf5vzbfyws22" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Meghann Cuniff</a> reported that the judge was particularly concerned about the possibility of jurors being recorded or subjected to facial recognition. (Meta&#39;s smart glasses do not currently have native facial recognition abilities, but recent reports suggest the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-reportedly-working-to-bring-facial-recognition-to-its-smart-glasses-144721330.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">is considering</a> adding such features.)</p><p>The Los Angeles trial has been closely watched not just because it marked a rare in-court appearance for Zuckerberg. It&#39;s among the first of several cases where Meta will face allegations that its platforms have harmed children. In this case and in a separate proceeding in New Mexico, Meta&#39;s lawyers have cast doubt on the idea that social media should be considered a real addiction.
