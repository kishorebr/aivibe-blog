			Meta acquires voice startup Play AI

			
Meta has acquired Play AI, a startup that uses AI to generate human-sounding voices.

A Meta spokesperson has confirmed the acquisition, according to Bloomberg, which also reports that an internal memo stated that the “entire PlayAI team” will be joining the company next week. (TechCrunch has also reached out to Meta for confirmation.)


	
	




	
	



Meta’s memo reportedly said that PlayAI’s “work in creating natural voices, along with a platform for easy voice creation, is a great match for our work and road map, across AI Characters, Meta AI, Wearables and audio content creation.”

The company has been making big investments in AI, including aggressive recruiting from OpenAI and a deal with Scale AI that saw the company’s CEO Alexandr Wang joining Meta to lead a new group focused on superintelligence.

The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Bloomberg had previously reported that the two companies were in acquisition talks.
