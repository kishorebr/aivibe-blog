<p>Tesla’s sales in California should be suspended for 30 days because its marketing around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving misled consumers, a California administrative law judge has <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=248b6a9f-efad-4aac-8e94-fc5f8161af01&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=ruled&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzE2L2NhbGlmb3JuaWEtanVkZ2Utc2F5cy10ZXNsYS1lbmdhZ2VkLWluLWRlY2VwdGl2ZS1hdXRvcGlsb3QtbWFya2V0aW5nLS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNDhiNmE5Zi1lZmFkLTRhYWMtOGU5NC1mYzVmODE2MWFmMDEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTIvMTYvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1qdWRnZS1zYXlzLXRlc2xhLWVuZ2FnZWQtaW4tZGVjZXB0aXZlLWF1dG9waWxvdC1tYXJrZXRpbmctLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUFHDNb8zjqgCgS3437jvQbUAPBFOWq4Y7Z9yQgIdJAE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F12%2F16%2Fcalifornia-judge-says-tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-autopilot-marketing-.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/california-judge-says-tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-autopilot-marketing-.html">ruled</a>. Back in 2022, the California DMV <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-accuses-tesla-false-advertising-130350292.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">accused the automaker</a> of using deceptive language to advertise those products and making  it seem like its vehicles are capable of level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla has since added the word “Supervised” to the name of its Full Self-Driving assistance technology.  </p><p>As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/tesla-s-sales-in-california-set-to-be-suspended-dmv-says?srnd=homepage-americas" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, the DMV asked the administrative law judge if a suspension is warranted based on the evidence it presented. Even though the judge has agreed that it is, the agency will give Tesla 90 days to explain its side and remove any untrue or misleading language in the marketing materials for the products. Tesla’s sales and manufacturing in California will only be suspended if it doesn’t comply within that timeframe.</p><p>“We’re really asking Tesla to do their job, as they’ve done in other markets, to properly brand these vehicles,” said California DMV director, Steve Gordon, in a statement.</p><p>A suspension in California could be devastating for the automaker. While new Tesla registrations in the state plummeted earlier this year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-first-quarter-registrations-california-fell-15-industry-data-shows-2025-04-16/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Reuters</a> says California accounts for nearly a third of the company’s sales in the country. In addition, Tesla only manufactures its Model S and X vehicles in its Fremont plant, where it also produces Model 3 and Model Y units. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-used-deceptive-language-to-market-autopilot-california-judge-rules-035826786.html?src=rss
