This &quot;reimagined FIFA football simulation game&quot; will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, and be available to Netflix subscribers next year, right in time for FIFA World Cup 2026.</p><p>EA and FIFA maintained a nearly 30 year partnership creating soccer games before they parted ways in 2022. EA continued its soccer series afterward as EA FC, but despite being in talks with &quot;leading game publishers, media companies and investors&quot; about &quot;a major new FIFA simulation football game title for 2024,&quot; a FIFA-backed competitor has yet to materialize. Instead, FIFA has mostly supported arcade soccer games in the last few years, like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://inside.fifa.com/organisation/media-releases/mythical-games-and-fifa-team-up-to-bring-new-football-arcade-game-fifa-rivals" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>FIFA Rivals</em></a> from Mythical Games and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKWU52Et1ww" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>FIFA Heroes</em></a> from ENVER.</p><p>While the game Delphi Interactive is working on is pitched as a &quot;simulation game,&quot; based on what little detail appears in Netflix&#39;s announcement, it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s targeting hardcore soccer fans in the same way EA&#39;s games do. Instead, this new FIFA title is designed to be &quot;a game that anyone, anywhere, can pick up and instantly feel the magic of football,&quot; according to Delphi Interactive CEO Caspar Daugaard. The game will also be designed to use a smartphone as a controller, possibly limiting how demanding or complicated gameplay can actually be.</p><p>This new FIFA game will be Delphi Interactive&#39;s second project as a studio after working on IO Interactive&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>007 First Light</em></a>. Backing approachable games that can be controlled with a smartphone is part of a new approach Netflix has taken with its interactive titles in 2025. The company has either <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-reportedly-shutters-studio-behind-squid-game-mobile-spinoff-151156987.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">cancelled</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-getting-rid-of-another-of-its-game-studios-by-selling-it-back-to-its-founders-203645232.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">handed off</a> its more ambitious game projects and studios, and zeroed in on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-bringing-party-games-to-tvs-123034128.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">party games</a> and adaptations as its main focus.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-post-ea-fifa-soccer-sim-will-be-a-netflix-games-exclusive-204321196.html?src=rss
