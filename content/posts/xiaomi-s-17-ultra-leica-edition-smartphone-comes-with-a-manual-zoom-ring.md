<p>Xiaomi just launched its flagship <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xiaomi;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=446ec9d6-e442-4d00-972f-5da520b0905e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d606a47e-5a7a-4677-845a-45a0f7212978&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xiaomi&amp;linkText=17+Ultra+by+Leica&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taS5jb20vcHJvZC94aWFvbWktMTctdWx0cmEtYnlsZWljYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDYwNmE0N2UtNWE3YS00Njc3LTg0NWEtNDVhMGY3MjEyOTc4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taS5jb20vcHJvZC94aWFvbWktMTctdWx0cmEtYnlsZWljYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAf7CgUftzbkptNsJzl3RjxVc5npiCpNp1uguw36z5Ptk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fprod%2Fxiaomi-17-ultra-byleica" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.mi.com/prod/xiaomi-17-ultra-byleica">17 Ultra by Leica</a> phone that may make you feel bad about your current device's cameras. Naturally it's a spec monster, with a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. But it also offers an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring that also activates the camera automatically when you rotate it.</p>
<p>Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness. On top of the impressive main and telephoto lenses, they also offer a 50MP ultrawide and a 50MP selfie camera. And battery life shouldn't be an issue, thanks to the 6,800mAh silicon-carbon battery that supports 90 watt wired and 50 watt wireless charging.</p>

<p>The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well Leica touches. Those include a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on front, textured edges and film simulations like Leica's Monopan 50 black and white. As for the zoom ring, Xiaomi says "its rotation [eliminates] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm." It can also be reprogrammed for functions like exposure compensation and manual focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features unique to that model include a "Leica Moments" 3:2 aspect ratio, special encryption chip, and dual-satellite connection. And as befits a special edition, it comes in a custom box with a lens cap, lanyard, magnetic case and branded cleaning cloth.</p>
<p>The one caveat is the price. Where phones for the Chinese market are often cheaper than North American models, Xiaomi's 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_17_ultra_packs_a_1inch_sensor_200mp_periscope_telephoto_and_a_6800mah_battery-news-70863.php">start at</a> CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995) respectively with 512GB or storage and 16GB of RAM — right up there with the latest high-end <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on-faster-curvier-and-way-more-ai-ier-180054396.html">Galaxy 25</a> models.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/xiaomis-17-ultra-leica-edition-smartphone-comes-with-a-manual-zoom-ring-093502893.html?src=rss
