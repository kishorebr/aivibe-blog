Bluepoint&#39;s last major project was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a> from 2022, which it co-developed with Sony Santa Monica.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Sony decided to shut down the studio following &quot;a recent business review.&quot; Around 70 employees will lose their jobs as part of the studio closure, which will officially happen in March. &quot;Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,&quot; Sony said in a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>. &quot;We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship.&quot;</p><p>Following their work on <em>Ragnarok</em>, Bluepoint was reportedly tasked with developing a live-service game set in the God of War universe. That title <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-axes-two-more-live-service-games-130048000.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">was cancelled</a> in 2025, alongside another game from Bend Studio. In the context of Sony&#39;s other live-service failures, the decision wasn&#39;t surprising. Sony shut down the servers for multiplayer shooter <em>Concord</em> just two weeks after its release. Not long after, it also closed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-concord-and-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-180321212.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Firewalk Studios</a>, the developer behind the game.</p><p>Bluepoint Games was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-155507719.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">originally acquired</a> by Sony in 2021, when it seemed like the studio&#39;s expertise in remaking and remastering classic PlayStation games could be a major asset going forward. Why that changed isn&#39;t entirely clear, but Sony&#39;s mismanagement of its pivot into and out of publishing premium online multiplayer games may have played a role. Some of Sony&#39;s studios are still experimenting with live-service mechanics. Guerilla Games recently announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/guerrilla-reveals-horizon-hunters-gathering-a-co-op-action-spin-off-for-ps5-and-pc-162058264.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">an online co-op game</a> set in its Horizon universe. <em>Destiny 2 </em>developer Bungie is also releasing its extraction shooter <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Marathon</em></a> in March. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-shutting-down-the-studio-behind-the-demons-souls-remake-195234213.html?src=rss
