<p>Google has been rapidly expanding the availability of AI Mode in Search ever since it <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html">previewed</a> the feature with testers in its Labs program in the beginning of March this year. Now, the company has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-languages-locations/">announced</a> that it has started rolling out the dedicated AI chatbot within Search to 40 new regions and has made it available in 35 new languages. The newly supported languages include Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, German, Greek, French, Malay, Russian, Thai, Vietnamese and more. Google says the advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding of its custom Gemini model for Search allow it to grasp the subtleties of local languages, so it doesn&#39;t misunderstand inquiries or generate stilted answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, two months after Google started testing the feature, the company rolled it out to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html">everyone in the US</a>. At the time, it said that it will &quot;graduate many features and capabilities from AI Mode right into the core search experience in AI Overviews&quot; as it gets more feedback. In early September, Google <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-expands-ai-mode-beyond-english-for-the-first-time-192245955.html">opened up</a> AI Mode to more languages, namely Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean and Brazilian Portuguese. More and more users in the new regions will see AI Mode responses in their Search page and will be able to interact with the feature in their preferred language over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company plans to add more capabilities to AI Mode and recently released an update that made it better at <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-mode-gets-better-at-understanding-visual-prompts-130001201.html">understanding visual prompts</a>. It&#39;s worth noting that, while AI Mode results could be useful for quick inquiries, online publishers attribute declining web traffic to the summaries. A <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/">Pew Research Center study</a> found that users are less likely to click on website links and are more likely to end their browsing session if they see an AI Mode summary at the top of their results page.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-search-ai-mode-is-now-available-in-more-languages-and-regions-043540278.html?src=rss
