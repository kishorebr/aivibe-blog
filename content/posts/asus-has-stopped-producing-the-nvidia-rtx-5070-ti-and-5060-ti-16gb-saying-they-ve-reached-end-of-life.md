<p>YouTube channel <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hardwareunboxed" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em></a> is reporting that ASUS has stopped producing the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-5070-ti-review-a-sensible-4k-powerhouse-for-749-140023082.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">RTX 5070 Ti</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-a-solid-semi-budget-gpu-for-429-but-good-luck-scoring-that-price-130058124.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">5060 Ti 16GB</a> due to the ongoing memory crunch. In its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">most recent video</a>, the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yteN21aJEvE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Hardware Unboxed </em>also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year.  The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well,&quot; with ASUS stating  it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to manufacture in the current economic climate.  And while there might be some hope of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB returning later this year, the channel suggests both are unlikely to make a comeback. </p><p>“Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget. ASUS did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request.  </p><p>After uploading its video, <em>Hardware Unboxed </em>published a clarification. “ASUS did not tell us that NVIDIA said the RTX 5070 Ti has been discontinued. ASUS told us there is very little supply of the 5070 Ti, so their own 5070 Ti products (e.g, the Prime and TUF Gaming) have been put into end of life status,” the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hardwareunboxed/posts" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">channel said</a>. “With retailers also unable to source 5070 Ti SKUs from any AIB, this effectively makes it a dead product.”  </p><p>The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">RAM kits</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">GPUs</a> and SSDs.

AIBs are the companies that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy from NVIDIA and AMD.   Historically, NVIDIA has provided its board partners with both the die and memory needed to make a graphics cards.
