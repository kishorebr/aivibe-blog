<p>Fall is often first-person shooter season, and looks like this year&#39;s release calendar will include the next entry in the Battlefield series. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is launching on October 10, and will be available to play on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam, Epic Games and the EA Play app.</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-finally-a-trailer-for-battlefield-6-but-no-multiplayer-details-just-yet-170144110.html"><ins>previous trailer</ins></a> for the first-person shooter only showed content from the game&#39;s single-player campaign. While there have been some solid stories in the Battlefield franchise, the main draw for many fans is the sprawling multiplayer matches, which were the focus of today&#39;s new trailer and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY&amp;rco=1">livestreamed event</a>. The signature Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough modes will return in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, as well as typical FPS fare such as Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. The new game mode coming this fall is called Escalation, where teams will face off to control and hold several capture points. On the map front, there are new locations in Egypt, Gibraltar, Tajikistan and Brooklyn, plus at least one familiar one: a remake of Operation Firestorm from Battlefield 3.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There will be four familiar classes for players to choose from: Assault, Support, Recon and Engineer. Other tweaks showcased in the multiplayer content unveiled today include a new Drag and Revive option, where downed teammates can be lugged to a safer spot before you rez them, and an option for wall-mounting weapons for less recoil. There will also be plenty of opportunities for high-tech environmental destruction between the tanks, rocket launchers, aerial assaults and drone-mounted explosives. Or you can keep it simple and smash stuff with a really big hammer.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t wait until October 10 to get into the combat, <em>Battlefield 6</em> will have two open beta weekends on August 9-10 and August 14-17. It&#39;s encouraging for fans to see some solid news about the upcoming game after an investigation by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/"><em><ins>Ars Technica</ins></em></a> surfaced some concerning problems with its development and with AAA gaming at large.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-gets-an-october-10-release-date-200150912.html?src=rss
