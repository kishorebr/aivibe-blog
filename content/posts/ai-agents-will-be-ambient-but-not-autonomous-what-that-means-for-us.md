    AI agents will be ambient, but not autonomous - what that means for us
     
    Coming soon: agents that take cues from their environment rather than waiting for human input.

Now the era of AI agents is here, with nearly every company offering its own solution. On the horizon, though, is a more advanced and even more promising milestone -- ambient agents.   On day three of the Cisco Live! conference, LangChain CEO and co-founder   Harrison Chase took the stage to discuss ambient agents, a concept pioneered by his San Francisco-based company. As the name implies, these agents take cues from their environment to commit actions rather than waiting for human input. Also: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blameWhat are ambient agents (and the perks)?Currently, the AI assistance that users receive is deterministic; that is, humans are expected to enter a command in order to receive an intended outcome. With ambient agents, there is a shift in how humans fundamentally interact with AI to get the desired outcomes they need; the AI assistants rely instead on environmental cues. "Ambient agents we define as agents that are triggered by events, run in the background, but they are not completely autonomous," said Chase. He explains that ambient agents benefit employees by allowing them to expand their magnitude and scale themselves in ways they could not previously do. Rather than 1:1 interactions between human employees and agents, ambience enables up to millions of agents to run in the background simultaneously. Instead
