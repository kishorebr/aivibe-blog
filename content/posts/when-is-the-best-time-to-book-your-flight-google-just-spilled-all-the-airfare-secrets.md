At least one layover was to be expected (at LAX) because Kentucky is a long way from the Aloha State. I could've saved some time, though -- and money -- had I known what Google's latest Flights report revealed.What is the cheapest day to fly?Based on Google Flights' latest aggregate data from 2021 to 2025, travelers looking for the most affordable airfare should consider flying early in the week. Tuesday has consistently been identified as the cheapest day to fly, followed by Monday and Wednesday. Opting for flights on midweek days can save you anywhere from 13% to 20% lower airfares than weekend travel. Also: The 9 tech gadgets I couldn't live without in 2025 (and most are travel friendly)Flying on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday tends to be more expensive, with Sunday pegged as the priciest day of the week to fly. These Google Flights insights reveal a consistent trend in airfare pricing, highlighting that booking a Tuesday departure can lead to cost savings for budget-conscious travelers.
