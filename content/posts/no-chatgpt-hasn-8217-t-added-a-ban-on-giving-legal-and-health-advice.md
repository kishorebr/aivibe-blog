<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI says ChatGPT’s behavior “remains unchanged” after reports across social media falsely claimed that new s updates to its usage policy prevent the chatbot from offering legal and medical advice. Karan Singhal, OpenAI’s head of health AI, <a href="https://x.com/thekaransinghal/status/1985416057805496524">writes on X</a> that the claims are “not true.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information,” Singhal says, replying to a now-deleted post from the betting platform Kalshi that had claimed “JUST IN: ChatGPT will no longer provide health or legal advice.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Singhal, the inclusion of policies surrounding legal and medical advice “is not a new change to our terms.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new policy update <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">on October 29th</a> has a list of things you can’t use ChatGPT for, and one of them is “provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That remains similar to OpenAI’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250902175341/https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">previous ChatGPT usage</a> policy, which said users shouldn’t perform activities that “may significantly impair the safety, wellbeing, or rights of others,” including “providing tailored legal, medical/health, or financial advice without review by a qualified professional and disclosure of the use of AI assistance and its potential limitations.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI previously had three separate policies, including a “universal” one, as well as ones for ChatGPT and API usage. With the new update, the company has one unified list of rules that its changelog says “reflect a universal set of policies across OpenAI products and services,” but the rules are still the same.</p>
