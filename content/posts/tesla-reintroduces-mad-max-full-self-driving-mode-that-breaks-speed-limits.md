<p>Tesla has added another brazenly stupid new entry to its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-is-investigating-tesla-over-its-electronic-door-handles-203605393.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">dubious</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/nhtsa-opens-investigation-into-tesla-remote-parking-features-194559802.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">safety</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-opens-tesla-probe-over-model-y-steering-wheel-detachments-153153318.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">record</a>. The latest update to Tesla&#39;s Full Self-Driving System adds a mode called Mad Max, &quot;which comes with higher speeds and more frequent lane changes&quot; than the system&#39;s Hurry mode. This feature isn&#39;t new; it was part of the Autopilot mode in 2018 that pre-dated FSD. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/16/tesla-mad-max-full-self-driving-mode-ignores-speed-limits/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Electrek</em></a>, the re-introduction of Mad Max mode is going exactly as well as you&#39;d expect: &quot;It hasnâ€™t been out for 24 hours, and it has already been spotted rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the speed limit.&quot;</p><p>Everything about this is a comically bad idea, or it would be comic if it wasn&#39;t so downright dangerous. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just opened an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">investigation</a> into the company&#39;s FSD system last week after receiving more than 50 reports of traffic safety violations in addition to numerous crashes. And this is just the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/feds-investigate-tesla-over-inaccurate-autopilot-and-fsd-crash-reports-175837772.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">most</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-fsd-is-under-federal-investigation-after-four-reduced-visibility-crashes-140248063.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">recent</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">time</a> the regulator has put FSD in its crosshairs. Choosing this moment to reintroduce an automated driving mode based on a post-apocalyptic wasteland where life is meaningless is a level of arrogance that does feel on brand for Tesla.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-reintroduces-mad-max-full-self-driving-mode-that-breaks-speed-limits-190659583.html?src=rss
