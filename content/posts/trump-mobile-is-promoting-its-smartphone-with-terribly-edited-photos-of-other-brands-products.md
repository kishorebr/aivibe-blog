<p>Since it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/god-help-us-donald-trump-is-launching-trump-mobile-and-plans-to-sell-a-phone-155830166.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> in June, Trump Mobile has committed to an increasingly-surreal smoke-and-mirrors approach to its promised T1 smartphone. Despite the initial claims that the phone would be made in the United States, it seemed <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-golden-trump-phone-is-almost-certainly-not-made-in-the-us-174536590.html"><ins>highly unlikely from the start</ins></a> that it was accurate. The &quot;Made in USA&quot; claims were <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobile-drops-its-made-in-the-usa-claims-193917169.html"><ins>quietly removed</ins></a> from the Trump Mobile website at a later date. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/08/21/trump-phone-still-doesnt-exist-beyond-a-terrible-photoshop-job"><em><ins>AppleInsider</ins></em></a> spotted the latest bizarre wrinkle to this story, which is that the actual phone still does not exist.</p>
<p>The publication noticed that promotional images for T1 all show different smartphones that appear to be tweaked in a photo editor to look gold. While the website shows a badly edited image of what appears to be a Revvl 7 Pro 5G phone, an Instagram ad seems to depict an iPhone 16 Pro Max, again with the company&#39;s branding overlaid. A third confusing image edit was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/TrumpMobile/status/1957955640565068159"><ins>posted</ins></a> on X earlier this week:</p>

<p>That photo shows a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra equipped with a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-s25-series-case-thin-fit">case</a> made by Spigen. The South Korean accessory company&#39;s logo can be seen behind the render of an American flag. Spigen&#39;s response sums our reaction up pretty succinctly: &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://x.com/spigen/status/1958570471022370864">??? bro what</a>.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobile-is-promoting-its-smartphone-with-terribly-edited-photos-of-other-brands-products-222940375.html?src=rss
