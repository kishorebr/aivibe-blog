    How these proposed standards aim to tame our AI wild west
     
    Not exactly a new sheriff in town, but this consortium of standards bodies seeks a different approach to controlling AI.

Yet, somehow, things eventually come together -- at least for mature systems -- and achieve interoperability, be it email networks or developer tools. Now, a new race against time has come to the fore, with efforts to tame one of the fastest-developing technologies seen to date -- artificial intelligence. Can standards groups, with their purposely slower and highly participative deliberations, stay ahead of the AI curve? And can they achieve standards across a technology as abstract and amorphous as AI, that also shifts every few months?Also: 60% of managers use AI to make decisions now, including who to promote and fire - does yours?There's a good case to be made for AI standards, as it is a technology riddled with traps: deepfakes, bias, misdirections, and hallucinations. And, unlike technologies that have gone before it, AI presents more than a software engineering problem -- it's a societal problem. A consortium of standards bodies seeks to take a new approach to AI, recognizing its wide implications. Active efforts are underway to involve non-technical professionals in formulating the standards that will define AI in the years ahead. A collective of standards bodies -- the AI and Multimedia Authenticity Standards Collaboration (AMAS) -- seeks safer AI for a justifiably skeptical world. The initiative, seeking to address the misuse of AI-generated content, was announced at the recent
