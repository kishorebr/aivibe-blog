<p>Microsoft was rocked by more than 9,000 job cuts this week. A significant number have come from its gaming division, resulting in the closure of multiple game studios and the cancellation of numerous in-development projects at Xbox and its contracted studios. We’ve already learned that Microsoft has closed the studio that was developing the much-anticipated <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reboot, and Rare’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs-162200526.html"><em>Everwild</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has also been sunsetted. And now Romero Games — the studio headed up by <em>Doom </em>creator and veteran developer John Romero — is another major casualty of the sweeping cuts.</p>
<p>The news was initially confirmed in a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248">statement</a> signed by Brenda Romero and posted on X. &quot;Last night, we learned that our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios,&quot; it said. &quot;This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control.&quot; It went on to say that the studio was powerless to change the outcome, and that the decision was not reflective of the quality of work its team has produced.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ireland-based Romero Games is not owned by Microsoft, but it appears the company’s financial support was crucial to keeping the studio alive — a fact that wasn’t publicly known until the shutdown occurred. <em>IGN</em> is now <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">reporting</a> that the entire Romero Games workforce has been let go, and many Romero Games employees confirm on Linkedin that they no longer have jobs.</p>
<p>According to the company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.romerogames.com/home">website</a>, Romero Games was founded by John and Brenda Romero in 2014, and had more than 100 developers on its staff. Its most recent release was 2023’s <em>Sigil II</em>, the unofficial sixth episode in the <em>Doom</em> series, which John Romero co-created in 1993 with id Software, the studio he also co-founded. The upcoming game was described by Romero Games as an &quot;all-new FPS with an original, new IP working with a major publisher.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-was-funding-romero-games-new-game-but-layoffs-have-left-the-project-in-crisis-172234905.html?src=rss
