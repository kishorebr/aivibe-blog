<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman Apple is testing Siri’s upcoming revamp using an internal chatbot called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/apple-builds-a-chatgpt-like-app-to-help-test-the-revamped-siri">Veritas</a>. The company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629940/apple-siri-robby-walker-delayed-ai-features">struggles</a> as it tries to keep pace in the AI race are no secret. The next-gen Siri has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/682984/apple-punts-on-siri-updates-as-it-struggles-to-keep-up-in-the-ai-race">multiple</a> times and the debut of Apple Intelligence was met with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685106/apple-ai-siri-delay-craig-federighi-greg-joswiak-wwdc-2025">tepid response</a>. Veritas gives Apple the ability to quickly develop, test, and collect feedback on new Siri features like “search[ing] through personal data… and perform[ing] in-app actions like editing photos.“</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Gurman Veritas resembles other chatbot apps like ChatGPT and Gemini. Employees type requests, have back and forth conversations, and can even revisit old exchanges to dig deeper on a particular topic. But, at least for now, it doesn’t appear like there’s any plan to release it to consumers. (Which Gurman believes is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-28/apple-s-chatgpt-rival-m5-macbook-air-new-monitor-timing-ads-coming-to-maps-mg3ne6rw?srnd=undefined">mistake</a>.) Instead Apple plans to keep its internal chatbot just that, internal. Instead it’s looking increasingly likely that Apple is going to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770712/apple-ai-search-tool-siri-google-gemini">rely on Google’s Gemini</a> for its AI-powered search. </p>
