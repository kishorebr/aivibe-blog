    AI agents are already causing disasters - and this hidden threat could derail your safe rollout
     
    The things that worry the chief information security officer - like what data is too sensitive to expose - are the concerns that can kill agentic AI.

ZDNET's key takeaways   Company experiments with AI agents are already causing disasters.  Zero-day issues are principally governance issues.FOMO will push companies to iterate with agents in the next year.Although artificial intelligence agents are all the rage these days, the world of enterprise computing is experiencing disasters in the fledgling attempts to build and deploy the technology. Understanding why this happens and how to prevent it is going to involve lots of planning in what some are calling the zero-day deliberation."You might have hundreds of AI agents running on a user's behalf, taking actions, and, inevitably, agents are going to make mistakes," said Anneka Gupta, chief product officer for data protection vendor Rubrik.    "These AI governance committees, internally, are often where these [AI]  projects go to die or get really blocked from going from prototype to production," says Rubrik chief product officer Anneka Gupta. "That's the first gauntlet you have to go through." RubrikGupta cited high-profile recent disasters of agentic AI technology. For example, an incident in July in which AI coding tool Replit deleted a company's entire code database. Replit's story is an example of "well-intentioned" automations, said Gupta. The Replit system was trying to carry out a code generation task for its user when it deleted everything. (ZDNET's Steven Vaughan-Nichols has the
