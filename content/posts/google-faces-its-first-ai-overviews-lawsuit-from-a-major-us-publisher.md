<p>Even though Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-trick-googles-ai-overviews-into-explaining-made-up-idioms-162816472.html">AI Overviews</a> were introduced with a comically <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953">rocky start</a>, it&#39;s about to face a far more serious challenge. Penske Media, the publisher for <em>Rolling Stone, Variety, Billboard </em>and others, filed a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/2025/09/14/penske-media-v-google-complaint-rolling-stone-owner-sues-google-for-ai-mode-antitrust-claim/">lawsuit</a> against Google, claiming the tech giant illegally powers its AI Overviews feature with content from its sites. Penske claimed in the lawsuit that the AI feature is also &quot;siphoning and discouraging user traffic to PMC&#39;s and other publishers&#39; websites,&quot; adding that &quot;the revenue generated by those visits will decline.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC&#39;s federal district court, claims that about 20 percent of Google searches that link to one of Penske&#39;s sites now have AI Overviews. The media company argued that this percentage will continue to increase and that its affiliate revenue through 2024 dropped by more than a third from its peak. Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said that the tech giant will &quot;defend against these meritless claims&quot; and that &quot;AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, Google faced a similar lawsuit from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/educational-tech-company-chegg-sues-google-over-ai-overviews-133017759.html">Chegg</a>, an educational tech company that&#39;s known for textbook rentals. Like Penske Media, this lawsuit alleged that Google&#39;s AI Overviews hurt website traffic and revenue for Chegg. However, the Penske lawsuit is the first time that Google has faced legal action from a major US publisher about its AI search capabilities.</p>
<p>Beyond Google&#39;s legal troubles, other AI companies have also been facing their own court cases. In 2023, the New York Times <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-york-times-is-suing-openai-and-microsoft-for-copyright-infringement-181212615.html">sued OpenAI</a>, claiming the AI company used published news articles to train its chatbots without offering compensation. More recently, Anthropic agreed to pay a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-pay-a-record-breaking-15-billion-to-settle-copyright-lawsuit-with-authors-192800292.html">$1.5 billion settlement</a> in a class action lawsuit targeting its Claude chatbot&#39;s use of copyrighted works.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-faces-its-first-ai-overviews-lawsuit-from-a-major-us-publisher-162333462.html?src=rss
