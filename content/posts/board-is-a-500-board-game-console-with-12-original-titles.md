<p>If you’re a person who enjoys the social side of online gaming, this product launch is not for you. Board was designed by entrepreneur Brynn Putnam, alongside former <em>World of Warcraft</em> exec Seth Sivac, as a way to make the idea of &quot;screen time&quot; a more immersive in-person experience. &quot;Families want to connect, but they’re competing with incredibly powerful technologies,&quot; Putnam told <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a3d97c91-2516-4b2d-b3f3-571fd0f4b810&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;linkText=USA+Today&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC8yMDI1LzEwLzI4L25ldy1jb25zb2xlLW1ha2VzLXNjcmVlbnMtc29jaWFsLzg2OTM0OTI2MDA3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTNkOTdjOTEtMjUxNi00YjJkLWIzZjMtNTcxZmQwZjRiODEwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC8yMDI1LzEwLzI4L25ldy1jb25zb2xlLW1ha2VzLXNjcmVlbnMtc29jaWFsLzg2OTM0OTI2MDA3LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdJ_2mzXpJcOC1gVNWqWX_Bbm70BMtMbrZfT6xA6EFqM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2025%2F10%2F28%2Fnew-console-makes-screens-social%2F86934926007%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:USA TODAY;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/10/28/new-console-makes-screens-social/86934926007/"><em>USA Today</em></a>. &quot;Board is about flipping that dynamic — using tech to support real human connection instead of replacing it.&quot; </p><p>The product acts like a typical tabletop game that you lay out flat, just like the cardboard play space for <em>Monopoly</em> or <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, but it offers additional digital interactions on the digital screen. The 12 games included are original to Board, each with unique piece sets.&nbsp;</p><p>Putnam has past experience creating tech that blends the physical and the digital. Her previous project, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-06-mirror-fitness.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Mirror</a>, was a workout screen for delivering live fitness classes at home. The company later got bought up by lululemon for a cool $500 million. Putnam is billing Board as &quot;the first ever face-to-face gaming console&quot; and at $499, its price tag nearly matches what you&#39;d expect for current console hardware. And that’s the limited time offer; the website says Board will normally retail for $699. The sales pitch leans hard on the idea of connecting families without their phones, but for that cost, you could also buy more than a dozen different board and card games to eliminate the screens altogether. And screens don’t have to be the enemy.
