<p>Eric Migicovsky, the creator of Pebble who's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-founder-eric-migicovsky-just-introduced-two-new-e-paper-smartwatches-160008363.html">reviving the e-paper smartwatch</a> with a new company called Core Devices, shared that the first new smartwatches <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/core-2-duo-alphabeta-test-signup">are coming next month</a>. The Core 2 Duo watch is on track to ship to pre-order customers in July and the pricier Core Time 2 is still on track to launch this year.</p>
<p>The $149 Core 2 Duo is "near mass production" according to Migicovsky, and should land in the hands of all pre-order customers during July or August. If you pre-ordered, you'll be able to confirm your order and shipping details later in June. Migicovsky says he's also aiming to have "working engineering samples" of the $225 Core Time 2 "within the next month."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 carry over the basic functionality of Migicovsky's original Pebble smartwatch, using either black and white or color e-paper displays, with health tracking, access to notifications and the ability to use the back catalog of classic Pebble watch faces and apps. The major difference between the two watches is that the Core Time 2 has a slightly larger screen, a metal frame and a built-in heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>Core Devices is also opening up a beta program to test early watch hardware and its new Android and iOS companion app for syncing notifications and watch faces. You can sign-up to join the beta test <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUwG4TpyWPefwkvWcpIZu0JLczIozF0KE0Tql-_cE67ThnHw/viewform">via a Google Form</a> and interestingly, Migicovsky writes that the new app will also be compatible with older Pebble hardware like the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-06-pebble-time-steel.html">Pebble Time Steel</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-05-pebble-time-round-review.html">Round</a> or the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-05-pebble-2-review.html">Pebble 2</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-spiritual-sequel-to-the-pebble-smartwatch-is-on-track-to-ship-in-july-182014025.html?src=rss
