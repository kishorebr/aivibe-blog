Cluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.

“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.


	
	




	
	



But he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. 

“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”

Cluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.

As Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”

For Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency.
