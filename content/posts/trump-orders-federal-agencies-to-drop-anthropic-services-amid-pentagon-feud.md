<p>President Donald Trump has ordered all US government agencies to stop using Claude and other Anthropic services, escalating an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-and-openai-employees-sign-open-letter-in-solidarity-with-anthropic-194957274.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">already volatile</a> feud between the Department of Defense and company over AI safeguards. Taking to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116144552969293195" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Truth Social</a> on Friday afternoon, the president said there would be a six-month phase out period for federal agencies, including the Defense Department, to migrate off of Anthropic&#39;s products.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution,” the president wrote. “Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before today, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had threatened to label Anthropic a “supply chain risk” if it did not agree to withdraw safeguards that insist Claude not be used for mass surveillance against Americans or in fully autonomous weapons.&nbsp;In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/secwar/status/2027507717469049070" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a post on X published after President Trump’s statement</a>, Hegseth said he was “directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”</p><p>Anthropic did not immediately respond to Engadget&#39;s comment request. Earlier in the day, a spokesperson for the company said the contract Anthropic received after CEO Dario Amodei outlined Anthropic&#39;s position made “virtually no progress” on preventing the outlined misuses. </p><p>&quot;New language framed as a compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW&#39;s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;We remain ready to continue talks and committed to operational continuity for the Department and America&#39;s warfighters.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Advocacy groups like the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) quickly came out against the president’s threats. “This action sets a dangerous precedent. It chills private companies’ ability to engage frankly with the government about appropriate uses of their technology, which is especially important in national security settings that so often have reduced public visibility,” said CDT President and CEO Alexandra Givens, in a statement shared with Engadget. “These threats undermine the integrity of the innovation ecosystem, distort market incentives and normalize an expansive view of executive power that should worry Americans all across the political spectrum.”</p><p>For now, it appears the AI industry is united behind Anthropic. On Friday, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-and-openai-employees-sign-open-letter-in-solidarity-with-anthropic-194957274.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">signed an open letter</a> urging their companies to stand in &quot;solidarity&quot; with the lab. According to an internal memo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/27/altman-openai-anthropic-pentagon" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">seen by <em>Axios</em></a>, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the ChatGPT maker would draw the same red line as Anthropic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a blog post published late on Friday, Anthropic vowed to “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and assured its customers that only work related to the Defense Department would be affected. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">company&#39;s full statement is avai</a><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">lable here</a>, an excerpt is below:</p><blockquote><p>Designating Anthropic as a supply chain risk would be an unprecedented action—one historically reserved for US adversaries, never before publicly applied to an American company. We are deeply saddened by these developments. As the first frontier AI company to deploy models in the US government’s classified networks, Anthropic has supported American warfighters since June 2024 and has every intention of continuing to do so.</p><p>We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.</p><p>No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons. We will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Update, February 27, 9PM ET: </strong>This story was updated twice after publish. First at 6PM ET to include a link to and quotes from Hegseth about the designation of Anthropic as a supply chain risk. Later, a quote from Anthropic was added, along with a link to the company’s blog post on the subject.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-federal-agencies-to-drop-anthropic-services-amid-pentagon-feud-222029306.html?src=rss
