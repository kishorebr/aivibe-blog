Also: GPT-5 is finally here, and you can access it for free today - no subscription neededThe company called specific attention to the testing results of its AI Red Team, which is OpenAI's security and harm-reduction operation. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)Based on the team's tests using its security protocols, "The results show that the reasoning model exhibited one of the strongest AI safety profiles among prior OpenAI models against several modes of attack, including malware generation, fraud/scam automation and other harms." Also: ChatGPT can now talk nerdy to you - plus more personalities and other upgradesMicrosoft said the upgrades will be available starting today, although at the moment of writing, they're still not available in my tool stack.
