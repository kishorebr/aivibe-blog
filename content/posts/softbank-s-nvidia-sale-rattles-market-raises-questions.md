Masayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last. 

His latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.


	
	




	
	



Consider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion. 

Amid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth $150 billion by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.

That Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley. 

After journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.

That didn’t turn out so well.
