<p>Amazon is shutting down the Prime Invitee program which allowed members to extend free shipping to people outside their household.

<p><em>The Verge </em><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769051/amazon-prime-free-shipping-benefit-sharing-ending">is reporting</a> that users who don't live with the primary account owner will be prompted to create their own Amazon Prime accounts and will be offered a discounted rate of $14.99 for the entire first year and then the standard rate of $14.99 per month thereafter. We reached out to Amazon to see what measures the company plans to take to prevent account sharing beyond limiting deliveries to one address, but the company didn't have any specifics to share.</p>

This arrangement is limited to two adults including the primary account holder and up to four children. Up to four teens can also be included if they were added before April 7, 2025. Household members who participate in Amazon Family can access free shipping, Prime Video and more.</p>
