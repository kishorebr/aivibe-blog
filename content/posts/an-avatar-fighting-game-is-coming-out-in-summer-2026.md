The developer, Gameplay Group International, revealed a trailer with some &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; that resembles <em>Street Fighter</em> but with our favorite characters from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/theres-a-new-avatar-the-last-airbender-cartoon-coming-to-nickelodeon-182956881.html">Avatar franchise</a>.</p>

<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/">Steam page</a>, the game will offer 12 characters at launch and introduce more on a seasonal basis. While the gameplay still looks like a rough draft, the developer has already detailed a unique fighting system, which includes a &quot;flow system&quot; and support characters that enable special moves. <em>Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</em> will also have the &quot;energy of classic fighting games&quot; and was made with a focus on &quot;fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity.&quot; Along with combo trials and a gallery mode, the game will have crossplay and be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam.</p>
