Future Motion has gone the other direction and emphasized how its new product can pop infinite wheelies, which sounds like either loads of fun or a quick way to an injury, depending on your worldview.&nbsp;</p><p>After developing a line of single-wheel skateboards called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/onewheel-gt-pint-x-future-motion-180021707.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Onewheel</a>, Future Motion has released a new transportation option with an e-bike dubbed Antic. (Though I am deeply disappointed it isn&#39;t named Twowheel). The 70s-inspired design claims a top speed of 35 miles per hour, a range of 28 to 50 miles, and wide tires intended to handle many types of terrain. It also says that with its Wheelie Assist mode, the bike&#39;s gyroscopes and accelerometers can hold an endless single-wheel ride. The base model Antic has a list price of $2,500 but is currently discounted a few hundred bucks for the launch; longer-range options with more capable tires will run up to $2,900.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/onewheel-teams-antic-e-bike-can-pop-eternal-wheelies-230602296.html?src=rss
