<p>DJI&#39;s obstacle avoidance system could be just as useful on land as it is in the air. DJI, known for its dominance in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-mavic-4-pro-review-a-new-standard-for-consumer-drones-120006235.html">drone market</a>, has entered the smart home world with a range of robot vacuums called <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.romo.tech/cn">ROMO</a>. Beyond its drones, gimbals and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html">action cameras</a>, the Chinese company previously branched out into other product categories, including portable power stations and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/djis-amflow-e-bikes-are-available-to-order-in-the-us-but-they-dont-come-cheap-174538774.html">e-bikes</a>.</p>
<p>For those wondering why DJI settled on robot vacuums as its next venture, it makes sense considering the company&#39;s &quot;omnidirectional obstacle sensing&quot; found in its drones. The same system that helps DJI drones avoid crashes when capturing cinematic footage easily translates into a robot vacuum that can navigate a home without running into furniture. Along with obstacle detection that can measure down to millimeters, DJI built its ROMO models with two flexible cleaning arms, an extremely high 25,000 Pa suction and a base station that the vacuum will automatically dock and clean itself in.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make it more efficient, DJI packed in machine learning algorithms that help the ROMO vacuums figure out the best route for cleaning. The onboard intelligence can even detect if an area is especially dirty and spend more time there. To make it less of a nuisance, the ROMO uses a noise reduction system while vacuuming and you can control it hands-free with voice commands.</p>

<p>DJI is offering the ROMO in three models: the entry-level ROMO S that starts at around $650, the midrange ROMO A with a transparent vacuum design that goes for around $750 and the top-of-the-line ROMO P that has both a transparent vacuum and base station for at least $950. DJI is releasing the ROMO to China first, but says overseas availability is coming later this year. While robot vacuums don&#39;t pose as much of a security risk as drones, DJI is currently trying to figure out how to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-evades-us-ban-but-has-one-year-to-prove-its-products-arent-a-national-security-threat-133042749.html">avoid a ban</a> in the US when the National Defense Authorization Act goes into effect at the end of this year. Unless DJI is audited and cleared by one of the US&#39; national security agencies by then, any new DJI drones would be blocked from being imported or sold in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dji-repurposed-its-drones-obstacle-detection-tech-for-robot-vacuums-191136030.html?src=rss
