<p>The Federal Communications Commission has added foreign-made drones and their critical components to the agency’s “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-fcc-is-investigating-whether-huawei-other-chinese-companies-are-evading-us-ban-150002185.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Covered List</a>,” making them prohibited to import into the US. In a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-1086A1.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">public notice</a> published by the FCC, it said several national security agencies have determined that umanned aircraft systems (UAS) and their critical components produced in foreign countries pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>“UAS and UAS critical components must be produced in the United States,” the agency said. “UAS are inherently dual-use: they are both commercial platforms and potentially military or paramilitary sensors and weapons. UAS and UAS critical components, including data transmission devices, communications systems, flight controllers, ground control stations, controllers, navigation systems, batteries, smart batteries, and motors produced in a foreign country could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over U.S. territory, including over World Cup and Olympic venues and other mass gathering events.”</p><p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr clarified on X that the ban does not affect old drones. People can continue using the devices they’ve already purchased, and retailers can keep selling models that have already been approved by the agency. The new rule only applies to upcoming models. He also said that the Department of War or the Department of Homeland Security can allow specific new models, a certain class of drones or particular components to be sold in the US.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, based on an Executive Branch national security determination, the FCC has added foreign-produced UAS (drones) and foreign-produced UAS critical component parts to the FCC’s Covered List on a going forward basis.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Trump has been clear that his Administration will… <a href="https://t.co/tVLlsBeOfw">pic.twitter.com/tVLlsBeOfw</a></p>— Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/2003179047438762084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The FCC didn’t name any manufacturers in particular, but one of the most well-known brands that will be affected by the ban is Chinese company DJI, which told Engadget that it was disappointed by the agency’s decision. “While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,” a spokesperson said.&nbsp;DJI has long been in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-evades-us-ban-but-has-one-year-to-prove-its-products-arent-a-national-security-threat-133042749.html" data-i13n="slk:US government&#x002019;s crosshairs;cpos:3;pos:1">US government’s crosshairs</a> and has been trying to prove that its products aren’t a national security threat.  </p><p>“DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by US government agencies and independent third parties,” they added. “Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market.” </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-bans-new-foreign-made-drones-and-components-053201854.html?src=rss
