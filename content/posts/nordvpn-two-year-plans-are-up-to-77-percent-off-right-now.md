<p>VPN users are overwhelmed with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">choice</a>, and there are as many bad options out there as there are good ones. Luckily, NordVPN sits in the latter category, and right now Nord is offering discounted plans across its various tiers. If you take out a two-year <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NordVPN;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0069d326-45b9-43cf-9dfd-1b9decf5fc9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;linkText=NordVPN+Plus+plan&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL3ByaWNpbmcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDY5ZDMyNi00NWI5LTQzY2YtOWRmZC0xYjlkZWNmNWZjOWEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZHZwbi5jb20vcHJpY2luZy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaVM0v5b5iPZc7x5Rcgc-ebmyr7sBiVAGPauCrl93EOx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fpricing%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nordvpn.com/pricing/">NordVPN Plus plan</a> (the company's most popular plan) it’ll cost you $108 for the duration of the contract, with Nord throwing in three extra months at no extra cost. That’s 73 percent off the usual rate.</p> 
<p>As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker.

That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>When Engadget’s Sam Chapman <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">reviewed</a> NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.</p>
