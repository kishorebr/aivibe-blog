<p>Samsung&#39;s take on the Vision Pro is here — and you can already order it. Costing just over half as much as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Apple&#39;s reality machine</a>, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR</a> has a 4K micro-OLED screen and a 100-degree horizontal field of view. The $1,800 mixed reality headset is available now for pre-order on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a>.</p>
<p>The Galaxy XR isn&#39;t <em>only</em> a Samsung product. The company developed the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">long-rumored headset</a> alongside Google and Qualcomm. It&#39;s the first Android XR product, a line that will eventually include AI glasses &quot;and beyond.&quot; You can read more about the headset and its ecosystem in Engadget&#39;s news coverage.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><core-commerce id="1a1e453a8c324e18835d035512cc802f" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Given Google&#39;s connection to the Galaxy XR, it isn&#39;t too surprising that the company has bonuses for early orders. If you buy the headset before the end of 2025, you&#39;ll get &quot;The Explorer Pack.&quot; That includes a year of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. Also included until the end of the year is the &quot;XR Pack.&quot; This adds three months of YouTube TV, a year of NBA League Pass, NFL Pro Era, Adobe&#39;s Project Pulsar, Asteroid and Calm.</p>
<p>You can order the Galaxy XR now from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a> and in Samsung Experience Stores. The headset costs $1,800. An optional Galaxy XR Controller costs $250. And somehow, the official Galaxy XR travel case also costs $250, which is — <em>yikes</em> — a lot. Perhaps consider waiting for third-party alternatives on the case front.</p>
<p>Samsung is offering a 24-month financing plan for the headset ($75.01 monthly) on its website. Meanwhile, Samsung&#39;s stores have that plan as well as a 12-month one ($149 monthly).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html?src=rss
