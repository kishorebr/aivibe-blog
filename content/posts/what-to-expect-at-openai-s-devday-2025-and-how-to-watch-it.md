OpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.

From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently building an AI device, a social media app, and an AI-powered browser to take on Chrome.

At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.

In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.

OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else.

Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possib
