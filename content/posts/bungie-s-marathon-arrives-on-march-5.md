<p><em>Marathon</em>, Bungie&#39;s long-awaited extraction shooter, will arrive on March 5, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">studio announced today</a>. Alongside a definitive release date, Bungie shared a new gameplay trailer, in addition to details about the game&#39;s forthcoming deluxe edition, which fans can pre-order today on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. All versions of the game will support crossplay, meaning you&#39;ll be able to play with your friends, no matter where they decide to buy <em>Marathon</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Sony, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buy-bungie-destiny-studio-180905449.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Bungie&#39;s parent company</a>, had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">previously committed to a March release</a> for <em>Marathon</em>, but stopped short of sharing an exact date.

This came after the company said it would take more direct control of Bungie. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html?src=rss
