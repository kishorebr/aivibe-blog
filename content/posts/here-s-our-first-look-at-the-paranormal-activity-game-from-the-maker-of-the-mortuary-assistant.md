In the short trailer for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3394030/Paranormal_Activity_Threshold/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Paranormal Activity: Threshold</em></a>, we&#39;re introduced to an unfortunate couple who has purchased a home that not only needs some serious work, but is also very much haunted. Cue creepy faces appearing in doorways and around corners.&nbsp;</p><p>While yet another installation in the Paranormal Activity franchise may not be what everyone is clamoring for, the fact that <em>Threshold</em> is being developed by solo dev Brian Clarke (DarkStone Digital), the creator of <em>The Mortuary Assistant</em>, is pretty promising. Per the game&#39;s Steam page, you&#39;ll be able to &quot;Play in multiple timelines; hunt and communicate with entities; perform demonic rituals to alter your fate;&quot; and &quot;discover multiple endings and expand the story.&quot; Each playthrough will be unique, thanks to the &quot;Paranormal Engine,&quot; it adds.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, there&#39;s no release date, but you can wishlist it on Steam. It was previously said the game would be released in 2026 on multiple platforms, but the Steam page only says it&#39;s coming soon.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-paranormal-activity-game-from-the-maker-of-the-mortuary-assistant-210657767.html?src=rss
