Cloud-computing company Lambda deepened its relationship with Microsoft through a sizable AI infrastructure deal.

Nvidia-backed Lambda announced it struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft on Monday to deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, according to a press release. The exact size of the deal was not disclosed. Some of these GPUs will be Nvidia GB300 NVL72 systems, which were announced earlier this year and began shipping in the last few months.


	
	




	
	



“It’s great to watch the Microsoft and Lambda teams working together to deploy these massive AI supercomputers,” said Stephen Balaban, CEO of Lambda, in the company’s press release. “We’ve been working with Microsoft for more than eight years, and this is a phenomenal next step in our relationship.”

Microsoft opened its first Nvidia GB300 NVL72 cluster in October.

Companies like Lambda, which was founded years before the current AI boom in 2012 and has raised $1.7 billion in venture dollars, are seeing strong demand as companies continue to gobble up AI infrastructure and compute.

This announcement comes just hours after Microsoft announced a $9.7 billion deal for AI cloud capacity with IREN, an Australian data center business.

Earlier today, OpenAI announced that it had struck a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon to buy cloud services over the next seven years. The AI company also allegedly inked a $300 billion deal with Oracle for cloud compute in September.
