<p>Microsoft is ending support for its ChromeOS competitor Windows 11 SE. The company will officially stop providing &quot;software updates, technical assistance and security fixes&quot; in October 2026, according to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/education/windows/windows-11-se-overview#cw">updated support document</a> spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-is-killing-a-special-windows-11-edition-for-low-cost-pcs/"><em>NeoWin</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-windows-11-se-170034899.html">announced in 2021</a>, Windows 11 SE was pitched as a simplified, lightweight version of Microsoft&#39;s operating system for the classroom. Chromebooks and ChromeOS devices are widely used in schools around the world, so it made sense that Microsoft would want to offer something competitive. Windows 11 SE, and the Surface Laptop SE that launched alongside it, were the company&#39;s latest attempt to do just that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Clearly the plan didn&#39;t work, as evidenced by Microsoft&#39;s decision to shutdown Windows 11 SE just five years later. The operating system was available on other low-cost devices, but it doesn&#39;t appear that it acquired nearly the same-sized audience as ChromeOS. If it had, Microsoft likely wouldn&#39;t be dumping it so unceremoniously.</p>
<p>Windows 11 SE isn&#39;t the first time Microsoft has tried to spin-off a more efficient version of Windows, though it did seem like the most thought out. For example, the company has also tried <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-windows-10-s-store-bing-edge-default.html">Windows 10 S</a> (which lives on as &quot;S Mode&quot; in Windows 11) and the never-launched <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html">Windows 10X</a>, a streamlined version of Windows for dual-screen devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Windows 11 SE devices will work after Microsoft&#39;s October 2026 cut-off, the company recommends &quot;transitioning to a device that supports another edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-is-killing-its-failed-chromeos-competitor-windows-11-se-200050553.html?src=rss
