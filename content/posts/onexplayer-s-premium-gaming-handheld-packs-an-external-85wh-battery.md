<p>For about the price of a mid-range custom PC build, you could instead opt for a top-of-the-line gaming handheld called the OneXFly Apex. OneXPlayer launched its latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/one-netbook/onexfly-apex-world-s-most-powerful-8-inch-handheld">Indiegogo campaign</a> for its upcoming handheld that starts at $1,399 and goes up to $2,299 for a fully kitted-out version. While most portable gamers are better off with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html">Steam Deck</a>, the OneXFly Apex separates itself from the crowd with high-end specs, an external 85Wh battery, and the option for liquid cooling.</p>
<p>OneXPlayer hasn&#39;t divulged the estimated play time you&#39;ll get with its massive battery, but it&#39;s designed to be quickly swapped out with a spare battery that&#39;s sold separately. If the battery runs low, you can either wait a few hours to recharge or hardwire into a power outlet to keep gaming. You can build the OneXFly Apex with up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 128GB of memory. The Windows handheld has up to 4TB of local storage, but you can expand it by another 4TB thanks to both a mini SSD and a microSD card slot.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OneXPlayer uniquely offers an optional liquid cooling module for the OneXFly Apex, which you have to pay $60 more for. While the starting price may turn people away, OneXPlayer also included non-contact capacitive joysticks that will never get <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-says-the-switch-2-joy-cons-dont-have-hall-effect-thumbsticks-for-reducing-stick-drift-145541325.html">stick drift</a> and Hall triggers that can be toggled for short or long travel modes to justify the handheld&#39;s cost. The OneXFly Apex crowdfunding campaign managed to reach its goal of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars, or roughly $12,850, in less than two minutes. OneXPlayer currently offers four configurations of its gaming handheld, which is expected to start shipping in January 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/onexplayers-premium-gaming-handheld-packs-an-external-85wh-battery-185515162.html?src=rss
