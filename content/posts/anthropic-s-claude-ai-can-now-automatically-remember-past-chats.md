<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic will <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/memory">now let its Claude AI chatbot</a> “remember” the details of previous conversations without prompting. The feature is only rolling out for Team and Enterprise users for now, allowing Claude to automatically incorporate someone’s preferences, the context of the project they’re working on, and their main priorities into each of its responses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic rolled out the ability for paid users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757743/anthropic-claude-ai-search-past-chats">prompt Claude to remember past chats</a> last month, but now the chatbot can pull up these details without Team and Enterprise users having to ask. Claude’s memory also carries over to projects, a feature that lets Pro and Teams generate things like diagrams, website designs, graphics, and more, based on files they upload to the chatbot. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems to be particularly focused on work-related details, like a &#8220;team&#8217;s processes&#8221; and &#8220;client needs.&#8221; Anthropic notes that memory is &#8220;fully optional.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic says users can view and edit the memory Claude has stored from their settings menu. “Based on what you tell Claude to focus on or to ignore, Claude will adjust the memories it references,” Anthropic says. Both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646968/openai-chatgpt-long-term-memory-upgrade">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758624/google-gemini-ai-automatic-memory-privacy-update">Google</a> have already launched cross-chat memories for their chatbots. Last month, a report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> linked ChatGPT’s rollout of cross-chat memories to an increase in reports of “delusional” AI chats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with memories, Anthropic is rolling out incognito chats for all users, which Claude won’t save to its chat history or refer to in future chats. Google similarly rolled out Private Chats for Gemini in August.</p>
