<p>OpenAI gave its AI chatbot a professional makeover with the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html">GPT-5.2 release</a>, and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1przx5w/are_they_giving_gpt_more_independence_or_what_ive/">some</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ps0qxm/chatgpt_becoming_very_sassy_and_humbling_recently/">users</a> are already complaining about its tone. For anyone who&#39;s finding ChatGPT rude or sassy, OpenAI has some welcome news since it&#39;s letting users further customize its personality with extra warmth or enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="c1e32e2740d34805acc40a10fd51608e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can now adjust specific characteristics in ChatGPT, like warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use.<br><br>Now available in your &quot;Personalization&quot; settings. <a href="https://t.co/7WSkOQVTKU">pic.twitter.com/7WSkOQVTKU</a></p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2002099459883479311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/openai/status/2002099459883479311">post on X</a>, OpenAI revealed that users can adjust characteristics under new Warm, Enthusiastic, Header &amp; Lists and Emoji options found in the Personalization settings. Between the four options, you can choose between more, less or default to fine-tune exactly how you want ChatGPT to sound in its responses. These new characteristics come about a month after OpenAI added Professional, Candid and Quirky options to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/">GPT-5.1</a> under the &quot;Base style and tone&quot; setting that&#39;s also found in the Personalization tab.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest customizations likely stem from the fiasco that OpenAI faced earlier this year when it rolled out GPT-5 to replace <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html">GPT-4o</a>. The outcry from users revolved around the latest update sounding less conversational and friendly, leading OpenAI to offer the option to choose between models and promising to make GPT-5 feel warmer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-now-tweak-how-warm-and-enthusiastic-chatgpts-responses-are-204003009.html?src=rss
