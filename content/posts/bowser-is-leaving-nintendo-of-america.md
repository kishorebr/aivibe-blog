<p>Doug Bowser, Nintendo of America&#39;s President and Chief Operating Officer, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">is stepping down</a> on December 31, 2025, according to Nintendo. Bowser&#39;s leadership responsibilities will now be split between two executives: Devon Pritchard, NoA&#39;s Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience, will take over as President, and Satoru Shibata, the current Corporate Director and Managing Executive Director, will act as the company&#39;s CEO.</p>
<p>Bowser first joined Nintendo in 2015 as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-20-nintendo-hired-bowser-vp-of-sales.html">Vice President of Sales and Marketing</a>, before <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-nintendo-president-reggie-fils-aime-retiring.html">replacing long-time President Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> in 2019. In comparison to some of the company&#39;s other leaders, Bowser was much less of a public-facing presence, but he still guided Nintendo of America through a transformative portion of the company&#39;s history. Nintendo not only opened <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-world-universal-studios-hollywood-opening-2023-175710087.html">a theme park</a> while Bowser was in charge, but also had a major Hollywood release in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-fun-safe-romp-135146207.html"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> and a successful console launch with the release of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-has-officially-launched-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-143310136.html">Switch 2</a> earlier this year. Bowser also weathered his fair share of controversies, including reports that Nintendo of America was failing to address <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-testers-sexual-harassment-gender-discrimination-040607823.html">issues of gender discrimination</a> among its employees.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers,&quot; Bowser said in a statement. &quot;Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself,” Bowser continued. “She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, &quot;Pritchard plans to build on the many experiences that allow consumers to connect with Nintendo&#39;s characters and worlds, from video games to entertainment to retail experiences.&quot; The company might be too big and successful now to feature someone with as much personality as Fils-Aimé, but if Pritchard plans to stick with business-as-usual, maybe Shibata could become <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnJHF-Pt7_0">the public face</a> Nintendo has been missing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/bowser-is-leaving-nintendo-of-america-221650389.html?src=rss
