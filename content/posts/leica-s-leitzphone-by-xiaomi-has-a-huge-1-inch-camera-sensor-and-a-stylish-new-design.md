<p>Alongside a global launch for Xiaomi&#39;s 17 Ultra (read about that right <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/xiaomi-17-ultra-global-launch-hands-on-leica-camera-143006810.html">here</a>), the company announced a further deepening of its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Xiaomi/status/2026975532978491730">relationship with Leica</a>. The CEO of Leica, Matthias Harsch, took to the stage to announce a new Leitzphone, which appears to be an even deeper collaboration than 17 Ultra by Leica, which is a <em>different</em> phone. Confused? That&#39;s fair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design-wise, Leica has shifted back to a single tone body color, which looks more &quot;Leica&quot; to this camera dilettante&#39;s eyes. And if you’re thinking you’ve heard of the Leitzphone before, you probably have: it was a series of phones made by Sharp that launched in Japan in 2021. They all had a 1-inch camera sensor, as does Xiaomi’s first Leitzphone. It also has a mechanical, physical ring dial around the camera unit to control settings like zoom, exposure and shutter speed.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The camera interface is also designed by Leica. It&#39;s designed to be as intuitive as possible, with an Essential mode in the camera app that strips away all those modes and labels, showcasing whatever you&#39;re looking to shoot. You can switch between a monochrome shooting mode and a more familiar punchy, contrasty Leica filter. And that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>Aside from that there&#39;s no major standout interface or UI changes that I could spot while trying out the Leitzphone briefly at Xiaomi&#39;s MWC keynote. However, if you&#39;re intrigued by the functionality — or the cameras — check out our hands-on coverage and sample photos of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/xiaomi-17-ultra-global-launch-hands-on-leica-camera-143006810.html">Xiaomi 17 Ultra</a>. The cameras are <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>All three iterations (the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra , the &quot;by Leica&quot; edition and the Leitzphone) have a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip and a 6.9-inch 120Hz display that can reach up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness. While cameras are naturally the focus, it’s a flagship device by pretty much any metric. It also has a 6,000mAh battery for extended vacation photo shoots.</p>
<p>Barring some Leica-tinged wallpapers and design accents, it&#39;s a lot like the 17 Ultra by Leica, just with different messaging. This is Leica&#39;s phone, made by Xiaomi, but does a rose by any other name still have great low-light photography? Maybe increased Leica branding will be enough to coax its camera fans into making this their next smartphone, perhaps.</p>

<p>After years of collaboration (and cute little badges), this may be the first pure &quot;Leica phone&quot; manufactured by Xiaomi but sold directly by both companies. It&#39;s priced at €1,999 (roughly $2,362), but it&#39;s not known yet whether this phone will launch in the US. Welcome to MWC, everyone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/leica-leitzphone-xiaomi-mwc-2026-135744417.html?src=rss
