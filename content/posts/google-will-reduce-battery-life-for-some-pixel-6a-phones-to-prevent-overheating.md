After <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-6a-battery-overheating-warning-3566640/"><em>Android Authority</em></a> reported on a pair of instances where a Pixel 6a battery overheated to the point where the device caught fire, the publication spotted some details in the latest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-16-is-out-complete-with-live-notification-updates-and-new-camera-features-170006072.html">Android 16</a> beta indicating that as a precaution, the Pixel 6a battery capacity and charging speed will be reduced.

The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles. Weâ€™ll contact impacted customers next month, with all the information they need to address the issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pixel 6a is due to receive software support until July 2027, but it's just the latest entry in this device line to have battery problems this year. In January, Google rolled out an update that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-pixel-4as-update-kills-its-battery-life-on-purpose-164532917.html">reduced battery life</a> of the Pixel 4a to increase stability for the 2020 phone model. Then in April, the company launched a program of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-launches-a-battery-replacement-program-for-swollen-pixel-7a-handsets-162204629.html">repairs and payments</a> after some instances of batteries "swelling" in the Pixel 7a.</p>
