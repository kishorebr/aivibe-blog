This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It's available in multiple colorways, but the silver one inexplicably costs $899.</p> 
<p>We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html">best MacBook computers</a>. Heck, it's even our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html">very favorite laptop</a>. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.</p>
