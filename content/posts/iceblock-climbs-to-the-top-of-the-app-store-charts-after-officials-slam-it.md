<p>US government officials have condemned ICEBlock and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/iceblock-app-trump-immigration-crackdown"><em>CNN's </em>recent<em>&nbsp;</em>coverage</a> of it, leading to more people hearing about its existence and downloading it from the App Store. Now the application, which allows users to add a pin on a map to show where ICE agents have recently been spotted, has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bengoggin.bsky.social/post/3lswgll3m4k2k">climbed</a> to the to the top of Apple's App Store charts. It's currently the number one free social networking app in the US and the third most downloaded free app overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>CNN's</em> piece talked about how the app's developer, Joshua Aaron, launched it in early April after seeing the Trump administration crack down on immigration. When the piece went live, Aaron said the app had 20,000 users, many of whom live in Los Angeles, where ICE has been raiding neighborhoods. In addition to letting users pin ICE agent locations on a map, the app also gives them a way to add notes, such as what the agents are wearing or what car they're driving. Any user within a five mile radius of the sighting will get an alert.&nbsp;</p>

ICE officers" when asked to respond to the report on the podium. She said that there's been a 500 percent increase against ICE agents who are just "trying to do their jobs and remove public safety threats from... communities." ICE acting Director Todd M. Lyons also <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-ice-acting-director-todd-m-lyons-news-coverage-ice-spotting-app">issued a statement</a>, saying that the app paints a target on federal law enforcement officers' backs. "<em>CNN</em> is willfully endangering the lives of officers who put their lives on the line every day and enabling dangerous criminal aliens to evade US law," he continued. "Is this simply reckless 'journalism' or overt activism?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and US Attorney General Pam Bondi both said the government is going after Aaron. "He's giving a message to criminals where our federal officers are," <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/attorney-general-pam-bondi-warns-iceblock-app-developer-watch-out-says-doj-looking-him">Bondi said</a>. "...we are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not a protected speech. That is threatening the lives of our law enforcement officers throughout this country."'</p>
<p>Aaron told <em>CNN</em> that ICEBlock doesn't collect personal data, such as device IDs and IP addresses, which <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/iceblock-an-app-for-anonymously-reporting-ice-sightings-goes-viral-overnight-after-bondi-criticism/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has confirmed in a test. The app is only available on iOS, because it would have to collect information on Android that could put people at risk.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/iceblock-climbs-to-the-top-of-the-app-store-charts-after-officials-slam-it-004319963.html?src=rss
