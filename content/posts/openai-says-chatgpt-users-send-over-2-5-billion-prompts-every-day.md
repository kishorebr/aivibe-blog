<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI’s ChatGPT sees more than 2.5 billion requests daily, with 330 million from users based in the US, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/sam-altman-openai-trump-dc-fed">data obtained by <em>Axios</em></a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The data suggests that ChatGPT users send over 912.5 billion requests to the AI chatbot each year. OpenAI spokesperson Rob Friedlander confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the numbers reported by <em>Axios</em> are correct. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although ChatGPT still has a ways to go to catch up to <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ai-personalization-and-the-future-of-shopping/">Google’s 5 trillion annual searches</a>, its rapid growth still poses a major threat to the search giant. In the span of just a few months, ChatGPT’s weekly users spiked from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users">300 million last December</a> to more <a href="https://openai.com/index/march-funding-updates/">than 500 million</a> in March.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, a report from <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704162/opeani-ai-web-browser-chatgpt">suggested that OpenAI is preparing</a> to release an AI-powered web browser in the coming weeks, which will directly compete with Google Chrome. The company took a step toward this milestone with last week’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/709158/openai-new-release-chatgpt-agent-operator-deep-research">launch of ChatGPT Agent</a>, a tool that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/710020/openai-review-test-new-release-chatgpt-agent-operator-deep-research-pro-200-subscription">complete tasks on your computer</a> for you.</p>
