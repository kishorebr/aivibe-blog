<p>AI company Midjourney has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.midjourney.com/updates/introducing-our-v1-video-model"><ins>released</ins></a> its first video model. This initial take on AI-generated video will allow users to animate their images, either ones made in Midjourney or uploaded from a different source. The initial results will be five-second clips that a user can opt to extend by four seconds up to four times. Videos can be generated on web only for now and require at least a $10 a month subscription to access.</p>

<p>Midjourney was one of the early names in the space for AI-generated still images, even as other platforms have pushed the forefront of the discussions around artificial intelligence development. Google's latest I/O conference included several new tools for AI generated video, such as the text-to-video <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-3-ai-model-can-generate-videos-with-sound-174541183.html"><ins>Veo 3 model</ins></a> and a tool for filmmakers called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-filmmaking-tool-flow-ai-generated-video-175212520.html"><ins>Flow</ins></a>. OpenAI's Sora, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html"><ins>debuted</ins></a> last year, is also a text-to-video option, while the more recent <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobes-firefly-generative-ai-video-app-is-now-in-public-beta-140030134.html"><ins>Firefly Video Model</ins></a> from Adobe can create video from a text or image prompt.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But being a little late to the video game hasn't stopped it from drawing the ire of creatives who allege that its models were trained illegally. In fact, this video announcement follows hot on the heels of a lawsuit against the company. Disney and NBCUniversal <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-and-universal-studios-file-suit-against-midjourney-for-copyright-infringement-154206053.html"><ins>sued</ins></a> Midjourney last week on claims of copyright infringement. And as with any AI tool, there's always a potential for misuse. But Midjourney has nicely asked that people "please use these technologies responsibly" so surely nothing will go wrong.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/midjourney-adds-ai-video-generation-192557140.html?src=rss
