<p>There may be plenty of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/next-gen-snapdragon-g-series-chips-will-power-handhelds-from-ayaneo-onexsugar-and-retroid-pocket-131733930.html">gaming handhelds</a> out there, but there aren&#39;t many horizontal options that let you play childhood favorites in the original 4:3 aspect ratio. To address that gap, Ayaneo launched a premium option with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/915">Pocket S Mini</a>. As a &quot;true 4:3 retro handheld,&quot; the Pocket S Mini won&#39;t have those pesky vertical black bars whenever you&#39;re emulating video games from the CRT television era.</p>
<p>Handhelds like the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-buy-anbernics-budget-ds-clone-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-for-3ds-emulation-183140820.html">Anbernic</a> RG405M and even Ayaneo&#39;s own Pocket Air Mini already offer a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the Pocket S Mini presents a more high-end build with a full metal frame and a glass front panel. The 4.2-inch LCD screen has a resolution of 1,280 x 960 and is flanked by Hall effect joysticks with RGB lighting, Hall effect triggers and &quot;crystal-textured&quot; buttons. Inside, the Pocket S Mini runs on a Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 chip and is powered by a 6,000mAh battery.</p>

<p>Unlike most of Ayaneo&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-game-boy-remake-will-have-an-early-bird-starting-price-of-269-174553644.html">other devices</a>, the Pocket S Mini isn&#39;t being done through a crowdfunding campaign. It&#39;s already available on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/goods/9505548108021">Ayaneo&#39;s website</a> with a starting early bird price of $319 for either the Obsidian Black or Ice Soul White options with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. As usual, the Retro Power colorway will only be available with the highest specs of 16GB of memory and 512GB of storage, starting at $479. We&#39;re not sure when Ayaneo will end early bird pricing, but the prices will eventually jump to between $399 and $559 for retail pricing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-pocket-s-mini-has-the-perfect-aspect-ratio-for-revisiting-classic-console-games-203926701.html?src=rss
