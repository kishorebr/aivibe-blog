Retro Games and Plaion Replai released a limited edition redesign of the best-selling computer, called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQQS17Xw9E">THEC64 - Black Edition</a>. Like its name suggests, the console is a modernized version of the classic Commodore 64 in an all-black shell.</p>
<p>THEC64 - Black Edition will come with 25 pre-installed games, but unlike the company&#39;s previous consoles, this one will feature &quot;neo-retro&quot; games from C64 developers who have designed new games on the old-school architecture. Once you finish all the new titles like <em>Sam&#39;s Journey</em>,<em> A Pig Quest</em> and<em> Hessian</em>, you can plug in your own USB drive to play custom games. According to Retro Games, the updated redesign comes with four save slots per game, plug-and-play HDMI compatibility and a USB joystick.</p>

However, Retro Games also designed a non-mini THEC64 that has a fully functional keyboard. The latest blacked-out version is now available on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF">Amazon</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://retrogames.biz/products/thec64-mini-black/">Retro Games&#39; website</a> for $119.99.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/relive-the-commodore-64s-glory-days-with-a-slimmer-blacked-out-remake-181259874.html?src=rss
