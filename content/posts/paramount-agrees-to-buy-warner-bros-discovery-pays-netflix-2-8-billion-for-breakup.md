<p>Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-form-next-generation" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">are officially merging</a>. The studio <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065280/43564764-9083-42d9-bcfc-084b656fced5.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">paid Netflix</a> the $2.8 billion termination fee it was owed for breaking its original deal to buy Warner Bros. earlier today, and the historic film studio has now formally accepted Paramount’s offer.</p><p>Along with the deal, which values Warner Bros. Discovery at $31 per share, Paramount is making several commitments to assuage the fears of regulators and the entertainment community. Those include a guarantee that the new company will produce 30 theatrical films annually, that theatrical releases will have a minimum 45-day window in theaters before they’re brought to video on demand (something Netflix <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-will-give-wbd-movies-45-day-theater-exclusivity-if-deal-goes-through-141223786.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ultimately also agreed to</a>) and that deal itself will close by Q3 2026.</p><p>This turnaround in Paramount&#39;s fortunes has happened quickly. Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount&#39;s offer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx" data-i13n="slk:was superior to Netflix&#39;s on Thursday;cpos:4;pos:1">was superior to Netflix&#39;s on Thursday</a>, and not long after the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-backs-out-of-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-233117188.html" data-i13n="slk:streaming service said;cpos:5;pos:1">streaming service said</a> that it wouldn&#39;t provide a counter offer, effectively abandoning its previous agreement.</p><p>Ultimately, Netflix and Paramount were vying for different parts of Warner Bros. Disocvery. Netflix was primarily interested in Warner Bros. proper, while Paramount Skydance wanted the whole company, cable networks and all. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators, which is the hurdle Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery face now. The general assumption has been that the close relationship Paramount CEO David Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison have with the Trump administration would smooth over any issues, but the deal will receive scrutiny abroad and likely also at the state level, based on a recent post from California Attorney General Rob Bonta.</p><p>Paramount Skydance has proven its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/paramount-bidder-skydance-vows-end-dei-policies-create-cbs-news-ombuds-rcna220541" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">willingness to comply with President Donald Trump</a>, but delays in closing the deal could be costly. The company is on the hook to pay Warner Bros. Discovery &quot;a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after September 30, 2026.&quot; The company also has to pay $7 billion to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal is terminated for regulatory reasons. Netflix lost the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery, but getting a competitor to potentially overpay for the studio might be its own reward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-agrees-to-buy-warner-bros-discovery-pays-netflix-28-billion-for-breakup-215936514.html?src=rss
