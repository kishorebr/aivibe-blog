<p>One of Google&#39;s Gemini-powered photo features is MIA in Texas and Illinois. The company confirmed to Engadget that Ask Photos is currently unavailable in the two states. It didn&#39;t say why. Google Photos&#39; Conversational Editing is reportedly missing in those states, too.</p>
<p>&quot;The ability to ask Photos to edit your images is not available to users in Texas and Illinois at this time,&quot; Google&#39;s statement to Engadget reads. &quot;We are working to determine how to make Ask Photos available to more users.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for why that is, we don&#39;t have confirmation. But the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, which first <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/pixel-10-ask-photos-texas-illinois-21101011.php">reported</a> the news, pointed to a pair of lawsuit settlements as a likely culprit. In 2022, Google <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-bipa-lawsuit-settlement-161237789.html">settled an Illinois class action suit</a> over Google Photos data privacy concerns for $200 million. Earlier this year, it <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/g-s1-65656/google-texas-settlement-user-data-collection">settled</a> one with Texas for $1.4 billion over collecting user data without permission.</p>
<p>The common theme in both settlements was biometric data collection. Lo and behold, both of the missing AI features require &quot;face grouping&quot; to be turned on. That Google Photos feature uses automated facial recognition to cluster pictures of the same person.</p>
<p>The tricky part comes when state laws require informed consent for data collection. <em>9to5Google</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/16/google-confirms-ask-photos-isnt-available-in-some-states/">notes</a> that only the photographer — and not the many subjects of their pictures — have typically agreed to Google&#39;s terms and conditions. That creates a head-spinning legal conundrum that could have easily led Google to play it safe.</p>
<p>Ask Google Photos lets you <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ask-google-photos-to-get-help-making-sense-of-your-gallery-170734062.html">type or speak queries about your picture library</a>. For example, you could say, &quot;What are all the cities I visited last year?&quot; or &quot;Show me the best photo from each national park I&#39;ve visited.&quot; Meanwhile, Conversational Editing lets you tweak images using natural language. It <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/all-the-new-ai-features-coming-to-the-pixel-10-phones-160017270.html">launched with the Pixel 10 series</a> in August and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-photos-conversational-editing-is-rolling-out-to-android-users-170057906.html">expanded to other Android phones</a> in September.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ask-photos-feature-isnt-available-in-texas-and-illinois-200536477.html?src=rss
