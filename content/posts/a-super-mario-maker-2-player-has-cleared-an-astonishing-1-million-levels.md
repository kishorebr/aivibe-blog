<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-super-mario-maker-2-review-switch.html"><em><ins>Super Mario Maker 2</ins></em></a> was released six years ago this past Saturday. While Nintendo didn't do a whole lot to mark the occasion, one of the game's most dedicated players sure did. DSteves hit a remarkable milestone by becoming the first to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioMaker/comments/1lnal17/1_0_0_0_0_0_0/">clear 1 million <em>SMM2 </em>levels</a>.</p>
<p>The Twitch and YouTube streamer had hoped to reach that point by the game's sixth anniversary and got there toward the end of a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.twitch.tv/dsteves/clip/RoundEnthusiasticDotterelTheThing-KKW6uBE9tmB-pIP1"><ins>18-hour marathon</ins></a>. In fact, DSteves cleared 1,000 levels during that single stream.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9603eabd935e4d17b022c6b498dcbaa1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/pBcdnx0D" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.twitch.tv"></iframe></div></div>
<p>After the 999,999th level clear, an emotional DSteves punched in the code for a custom level a player named raysfire created just for this occasion â€” you can try it yourself by entering the level ID QKQ-4TD-0DG. Since this is <em>SMM2</em>, of course there was some cheap (or should that be Cheep Cheep?) trolling from raysfire, such as a Question Block that dispensed an enemy instead of a power-up. DSteves died a couple of times while playing this level, including to Bowser fireballs that were disguised by a bunch of coins.</p>
<p>DSteves said on the stream it took six years and eight hours to beat 1 million <em>SMM2 </em>levels, and then toasted the achievement with some champagne. The vast majority of the level clears, nearly 800,000 of them, occurred in one Endless Challenge streak on Easy difficulty (just slightly more than my current streak of 581). So, DSteves didn't exactly grind through several hundred thousand ultra-hard kaizo-style stages, but it's still an impressive achievement.</p>
<p>To reach the goal, DSteves cleared an average of 456.4 levels per day. The streamer skipped more than 80,000 levels, died more than 772,000 times and hit the million mark with about 165,000 more stage clears than the player in second place (I love that <em>SMM2 </em>shows these stats publicly).</p>
<p>Despite hitting an astounding number of cleared levels, DSteves isn't done with <em>SMM2</em>. The streamer was back to playing the game the following night and, at the time of writing, has now beaten 1,000,050 <em>Super Mario Maker 2 </em>stages.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-super-mario-maker-2-player-has-cleared-an-astonishing-1-million-levels-192445569.html?src=rss
