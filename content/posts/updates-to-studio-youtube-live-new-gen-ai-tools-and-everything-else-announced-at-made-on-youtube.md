At its annual Made on YouTube event this week, YouTube unveiled tons of new updates, features, and tools geared toward creators, including updates to YouTube Live, new ways to monetize, and more.

Studio updates include “likeness” detection and lip-synced dubs, and the company is offering new AI tools for podcasters to help promote their shows. 


	
	




	
	



Here’s everything announced at Made on YouTube. 

A new Studio

The company showed off new and updated tools to Studio, which creators use to manage their channels and track analytics. Updates include an inspiration tab, title A/B testing features, auto dubbing, and more.

What caught our attention is the “likeness”-detection feature, which was announced last year and made available to a few creators; it’s now in open beta. People will be able to detect, manage, and flag for removal any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness.

An AI-powered Ask Studio can guide users and answer questions about their account, and creators will be able to collaborate with up to five other people on one video, which is available to the audiences of all the participating video makers.

YouTube Live

YouTube gave Live, its livestreaming platform, some updates as well, like letting creators play minigames to entertain viewers, broadcasting simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical formats, providing AI-powered highlights, reacting to live events, using a new ad format, and more.
