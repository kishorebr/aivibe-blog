<p>Elon Musk has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musk-says-xai-take-legal-action-against-apple-over-app-store-rankings-2025-08-12/">accused</a> Apple of committing an &quot;unequivocal antitrust violation&quot; by favoring OpenAI in the App Store rankings. In a post on X, he <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955073616996975095">claimed</a> that Apple has made it impossible for other AI companies to reach number one in those rankings and that xAI &quot;will take immediate legal action.&quot; Musk didn&#39;t clarify what he meant by that, and he also didn&#39;t provide evidence that would prove Apple&#39;s supposed antitrust violation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955046467993059530">earlier post</a> on X that&#39;s currently pinned to the top of his profile, however, he tagged Apple, asking the company why it &quot;[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its]  &quot;Must Have&quot; section. He said X is &quot;the #1 news app in the world,&quot; while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. &quot;Are you playing politics? What gives?&quot; he continued. In a statement sent to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/musk-accuses-apple-of-unfairly-favoring-openai-among-iphone-apps"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-says-the-app-store-is-fair-and-free-of-bias-in-response-to-musks-legal-threats-235555807.html">denied any wrongdoing</a> and said that the App Store &quot;is designed to be fair and free of bias.&quot; The spokesperson added: &quot;We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria. Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1955094792804720660">posted a response</a> to Musk&#39;s accusation on X, calling it a &quot;remarkable claim,&quot; given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates &quot;X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn&#39;t like.&quot; To note, Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chinas-deepseek-ai-assistant-becomes-top-free-iphone-app-as-us-tech-stocks-take-a-hit-134445151.html">became the top-rated</a> free app on Apple&#39;s App Store back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="c641db93256549f0ac60d7a882e0a9da"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. <br><br>xAI will take immediate legal action.</p>â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1955073616996975095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>While Musk didn&#39;t mention it, Apple has an <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-baked-into-apple-intelligence-185026662.html">ongoing partnership</a> with OpenAI. The company has integrated ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence to power cloud-based queries for its platforms. More recently, the company said that Apple Intelligence will leverage the capabilities <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-bring-gpt-5-to-apple-intelligence-in-ios-ipad-os-and-macos-26-143210831.html">of OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5</a> in iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, which are set to arrive sometime in September.&nbsp;</p>
