<p>There&#39;s a new shop management sim in town. <em>Discounty</em> will be released on August 21 for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The game tasks players with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqI0iy6DIBI">managing a discount supermarket</a> in a bustling town.</p>
<p>The core gameplay loop reminds me of the shopkeeper portion of <em>Moonlighter</em>, but <em>Discounty</em> lets folks freely organize the shop&#39;s layout. It&#39;s also more than just a management sim. Players can walk around the town and &quot;get caught up in small-town drama&quot; while attempting to strike lucrative trade deals.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a story here, as the tight knit community of Blomkest will react to how well the shop is doing. Getting too popular could ruffle feathers in the town, so players will have to manage sales expectations against the needs of the community. A tagline asks &quot;will you pursue endless profits, or find a way to benefit everyone in Blomkest?&quot;</p>
<p>First time developer Crinkle Cut Games promises that the game holds some kind of dark secret, and we are dying to know what it is. Do capitalistic ghosts come out at night to haunt the town&#39;s residents? We&#39;ll find out this August.</p>
