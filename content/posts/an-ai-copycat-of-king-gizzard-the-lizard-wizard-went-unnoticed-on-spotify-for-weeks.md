<p>Despite making some moves to address the proliferation of AI-generated audio on its platform, Spotify failed to catch a copycat making imitations of music by King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard. The long-running experimental rock band from Australia, has been a vocal critic of Spotify and was one of several artists that took their music <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-08-08/king-gizzard-at-the-bowl" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">off the platform</a> in the summer. The move was in response to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/daniel-ek-is-stepping-down-as-spotify-ceo-161519791.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">discovery</a> that outgoing CEO Daniel Ek was a leading investor in an AI-focused weapons and military company. Today, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1phag1t/spotify_now_features_ai_band_clones/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">poster</a> on Reddit was recommended what appeared to be an AI-generated copy of one of the band&#39;s songs in Spotify’s Release Radar playlist. The phony artist was called King Lizard Wizard and it had an album of tracks all sharing titles with songs by the original band and using their original lyrics. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/king-gizzard-spotify-ai-knockoff" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Futurism</em></a> grabbed screenshots of the imposter, although it appears to have since been taken down; only the band&#39;s original page appears in searches for both their name and the AI name.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the phony King Gizzard band&#39;s album went unnoticed by the company for weeks before today&#39;s social post surfaced it. The Reddit thread points to several other anecdotal cases where someone attempted to trick listeners with AI-generated versions of popular bands. In September, Spotify <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">unveiled</a> a spam filter for catching AI slop, as well as policies for disclosing AI use in the content it hosts and how it would tackle AI impersonations. An instance like this, particularly when it features an artist that had left the platform in protest, creates a pretty big question mark about how well those policies are working.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/an-ai-copycat-of-king-gizzard--the-lizard-wizard-went-unnoticed-on-spotify-for-weeks-220018144.html?src=rss
