<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is getting ready to dump even more AI-generated posts into your social feeds. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said the company will “add yet another huge corpus of content” to its recommendations system as AI “makes it easier to create and remix” work that gets shared online.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social media has gone through two eras so far,” Zuckerberg said. “First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly. The second was when we added all of the Creator content.” Though Zuckerberg stops short of calling AI the third era of social media, it’s clear that the technology will be heavily involved in what comes next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zuckerberg said that recommendation systems that “deeply understand” AI-generated posts and “show you the right content” will become “increasingly valuable.” The company has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891128/meta-ai-assistant-characters-whatsapp-instagram-connect">begun embedding AI tools</a> across its apps and is now experimenting with dedicated AI social apps, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta CFO Susan Li said people generated over 20 billion images <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/786499/meta-ai-vibes-feed-discover-videos">within the company’s new Vibes app</a>, which serves up a feed of AI-generated videos, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/791290/openai-sora-ai-generated-video-hands-on">similar to OpenAI’s Sora</a>. “I think that Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,” Zuckerberg added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">Meta reported revenue</a> of $51.24 billion this quarter, up 26 percent year over year, but took a one-time $15.93 billion tax charge associated with President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.</p>
