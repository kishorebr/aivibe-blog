    How AI and Rust are rewriting Linux and Windows programming
     
    You might be surprised to learn that Microsoft is far more aggressive about Rust adoption than Linux.

Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases" and to "evolve and augment our infrastructure to enable translating Microsoft's largest C and C++ systems to Rust." Also: Linux will be unstoppable in 2026 - but one open-source legend may not surviveIf that sounds to you like Microsoft is going to rewrite Windows using AI from C to Rust, you're not alone. Hunt has since backed away from that interpretation, writing, "Windows is not being rewritten in Rust with AI." Still, one cannot help but wonder. After all, Hunt continued, "We are building tech to make migration from language to language possible," which is what you'd need to do first if you did want to move Windows from C to Rust. And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said 20% to 30% of Microsoft's code was "written by software," that is, AI. And, far earlier, in 2022, Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich tweeted, "It's time to halt starting any new projects in C/C++ and use Rust ... For the sake of security and reliability. The industry should declare those languages as deprecated." Also: Why your coding skills are more e
