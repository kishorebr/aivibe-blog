<p>Users on ChatGPT&#39;s free and Go plans in the US may now start to see ads as OpenAI has started testing them in the chatbot. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced plans</a> to bring ads to ChatGPT. At the time, the company said it would display sponsored products and services that are relevant to the current conversations of logged-in users, though they can disable personalization and &quot;clear the data used for ads” whenever they wish.</p><p>“Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks,” OpenAI wrote in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a blog post</a>. “We’re starting with a test to learn, listen and make sure we get the experience right.”</p><p>These ads will appear below at the bottom of chats. They&#39;re labeled and separated from ChatGPT&#39;s answers. Ads won&#39;t have an impact on ChatGPT&#39;s responses. </p><p>Ads won&#39;t appear when users are conversing with ChatGPT about regulated or sensitive topics such as health, mental wellbeing or politics. Users aged under 18 won&#39;t see ads in ChatGPT during the tests either. Moreover, OpenAI says it won&#39;t share or sell users&#39; conversations or data to advertisers.&nbsp;</p><p>A source close to the company told <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=adbd864e-a512-49a6-bdb0-b4ebd6bfe182&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzA5L3NhbS1hbHRtYW4tdG91dHMtY2hhdGdwdC1ncm93dGgtYXMtb3BlbmFpLW5lYXJzLTEwMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZ1bmRpbmcuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWRiZDg2NGUtYTUxMi00OWE2LWJkYjAtYjRlYmQ2YmZlMTgyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzA5L3NhbS1hbHRtYW4tdG91dHMtY2hhdGdwdC1ncm93dGgtYXMtb3BlbmFpLW5lYXJzLTEwMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZ1bmRpbmcuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfiUHzpw734ZMShijw4Q3-kcZBXuCDn32yY8zZe3fZKF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fsam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/sam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> that OpenAI expects ads to account for less than half of its revenue in the long run. Currently the company also takes a cut of items bought through its chatbot via the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-you-buy-things-from-etsy-within-chatgpt-110032055.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">shopping integration</a> feature.
