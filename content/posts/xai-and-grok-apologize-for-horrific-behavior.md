In a series of posts on X, the AI chatbot Grok apologized for what it admitted was “horrific behavior.”

The posts appear to be an official statement from xAI, the Elon Musk-led company behind Grok, as opposed to an AI-generated explanation for Grok’s posts. (xAI recently acquired X, where Grok is prominently featured.)
