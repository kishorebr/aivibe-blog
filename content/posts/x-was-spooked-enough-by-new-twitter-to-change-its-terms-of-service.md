<p>Despite changing its name and using decidedly bird-free branding, X is trying to hold on to its original Twitter trademarks, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>TechCrunch </em>reports</a>. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">xAI-owned social media platform</a> has updated its terms of service to include references to Twitter after previously only mentioning X, and seemingly attempted to counter a startup&#39;s petition to cancel the company&#39;s Twitter trademarks with a petition of its own.</p><p>The startup X appears to be responding to is Operation Bluebird, a company cofounded by former Twitter general counsel Stephen Coates that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/can-twitter-fly-again-startup-wants-to-pry-iconic-trademark-from-musks-x/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">went public last week </a>with plans to capture what remains of Twitter for its own use. The first step in that process was filing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26364751-ttabvue-92090266-can-1/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a petition</a> with the US Patents and Trademark Office to cancel X&#39;s control of Twitter’s trademarks.</p><p>&quot;The TWITTER and TWEET brands have been eradicated from X Corp.’s products, services and marketing, effectively abandoning the storied brand, with no intention to resume use of the mark,&quot; Operation Bluebird explained in the petition. “Petitioner seeks to use and register the TWITTER and TWEET brands for new products and services, including a social media platform that will be located at the website <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://twitter.new" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">twitter.new</a></a>.&quot;</p><p>In fairness to Operation Bluebird, Elon Musk was very open about his plan to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-is-rebranding-twitter-to-x-and-killing-the-bird-logo-165944573.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">abandon the Twitter name and bird logo</a> after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">he acquired the company</a> in 2022. &quot;And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Musk posted</a> in July 2022, not long before Twitter was rebranded to X. Even after the platform rebranded, though, at least one remnant of the original Twitter brand has stuck around: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Twitter.com" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Twitter.com</a></a> still redirects to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://X.com" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">X.com</a></a>.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The updated <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/en/tos" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">terms of service</a> <em>TechCrunch</em> spotted now say that as of January 16, 2025, &quot;nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.&quot; The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gerbenlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DDE-1-25-cv-01510-1.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">counterpetition</a> also reiterates that the Twitter trademarks are X&#39;s &quot;exclusive property.&quot;</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Coates said that Operation Bluebird’s cancellation petition was “based on well-established trademark law” and that he believes the upstart will prevail. “X legally abandoned the TWITTER mark, publicly declared the Twitter brand ‘dead,’ and spent substantial resources establishing a new brand identity. Our cancellation petition is based on well-established trademark law and we believe we will be successful. They said goodbye. We say hello.”</p><p>At the time of writing, Operation Bluebird has convinced over 145,200 people to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.twitter.new/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">claim a handle</a> on the company&#39;s new social platform. Maybe X sees that early interest as a threat, but it&#39;s just as possible Operation Bluebird&#39;s public comments were enough to tip the company off so it could try to hold on to trademarks it clearly believes still hold some value.</p><p><strong>Update, December 16, 2025, 4:13PM PT:</strong> This story was updated to add a statement from Stephen Coates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-was-spooked-enough-by-new-twitter-to-change-its-terms-of-service-231138305.html?src=rss
