Lanyards and cross-body straps for phones are becoming pretty common these days. If you&#39;re someone who travels every now and then, they can help protect you from pickpockets or from accidentally leaving your phone behind while you struggle with your luggage. The lanyard on Beats&#39; case comes with something extra: It has an adaptor at the end that slides open and attaches to a magnetic part on the side of the case so that it can act as a kickstand for hands-free phone use. The Beats iPhone 17 Kickstand Case with MagSafe &amp; Camera Control is available in Granite Gray, Bedrock Blue, Lime Stone and Pebble Pink. You can get it from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=437722c1-e012-4dc4-b1b3-05fa82a9e425&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Apple%27s+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy9hbGwvYmVhdHMtZmVhdHVyZWQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQzNzcyMmMxLWUwMTItNGRjNC1iMWIzLTA1ZmE4MmE5ZTQyNSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvYWxsL2JlYXRzLWZlYXR1cmVkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVsnLDrYggiOIt6aYE_f4MmKKA_TRfRzAZYGyrbbV9xV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fbeats-featured" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/beats-featured">Apple&#39;s website</a> for $59.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new collection also includes a basic case that Beats describes as &quot;thin, light, and precisely crafted.&quot; It&#39;s available in the same colors, with the same matte hard outer shell that prevents fingerprints and an interior microfiber lining. This model will set you back $45 and is the only one in the collection that you can get for the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-air-is-apples-thinnest-phone-yet-174342422.html">iPhone Air</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Beats designed it with a rugged polymer backing that&#39;s complemented by impact-absorbing sidewalls. It has an enclosed bottom for enhanced protection and a textured matte exterior to give you a good grip on your phone. The manufacturer said it put the case through repeated drop and scratch tests, as well as multiple thermal, mechanical and chemical tests to simulate real world use. Beats&#39; rugged case is available in Everest Black, Rocky Blue, Alpine Gray and Sierra Orange for $79.</p>
