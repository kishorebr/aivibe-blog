<p>Hideki Sato, who led the design of Sega&#39;s beloved consoles from the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, died on Friday, according to the Japanese gaming site <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/beep2021/status/2022662105904877996" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Beep21</em></a>. He was 77. Sato worked with Sega from 1971 until the early 2000s, but he&#39;s best known for his involvement in the development of the Sega arcade games and home consoles that defined many late Gen X and early millennial childhoods, starting with the SG-1000 to the Genesis, Saturn and Dreamcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="width:608px;height:637px;"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hClrxLODFU">https://t.co/hClrxLODFU</a></p>— Beep21 (@Beep2021) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beep2021/status/2022663839184232595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></blockquote>


</div><p>Sato went on to serve as Sega&#39;s president from 2001 to 2003. In the post announcing his death, <em>Beep21</em>, which interviewed Sato numerous times over the years, wrote (translated from Japanese), &quot;He was truly a great figure who shaped Japanese gaming history and captivated Sega fans all around the world. The excitement and pioneering spirit of that era will remain forever in the hearts and memories of countless fans, for all eternity.&quot; Sato&#39;s passing comes just a few months after that of Sega co-founder <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">David Rosen</a>, who died in December at age 95.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hideki-sato-known-as-the-father-of-sega-hardware-has-reportedly-died-230634768.html?src=rss
