<p><em>Bloodborne</em> fans may not be happy to hear that a remake was reportedly rejected, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s completely off the table. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-155507719.html">Bluepoint Games</a>, Sony&#39;s closed-down studio behind many PlayStation remakes, pitched remaking the classic Gothic horror RPG in early 2025, but was blocked by the game&#39;s developer, FromSoftware, according to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.</p>
<p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> reported, Bluepoint pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake after several years of working towards a live-service title in the God of War franchise that was ultimately canceled. Looking for the next project, a modern-day version of <em>Bloodborne</em> made a lot of sense, considering the title came out in 2015 and Bluepoint was responsible for the successful <em>Demon&#39;s Souls</em> remake in 2020. However, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources said that FromSoftware was against it, but didn&#39;t offer a concrete reason why. With some digging, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Jason Schreier pointed to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">interview</a> from Kinda Funny Games with PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida, which aired last year. In the video, Yoshida mentioned that FromSoftware&#39;s president, Hidetaka Miyazaki, wanted to pursue a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake, but was too busy to do it himself and &quot;doesn&#39;t want anyone else to touch it.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After failing to get the <em>Bloodborne</em> remake greenlit, Bluepoint wasn&#39;t able to secure another project for more than a year, according to the <em>Bloomberg</em> report. Now that Bluepoint has been <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-shutting-down-the-studio-behind-the-demons-souls-remake-195234213.html">shut down</a>, we&#39;re likely even further away from a remake. That&#39;s not to say a remake will never happen, but when it does, it&#39;ll have to get a stamp of approval and likely a lot of oversight from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-switch-2-2026-release-142025792.html">FromSoftware</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/shuttered-studio-bluepoint-reportedly-pitched-a-bloodborne-remake-but-it-got-shot-down-by-fromsoftware-173744228.html?src=rss
