<p>Several of Waymo&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-driverless-cars-will-start-driving-on-freeways-in-three-us-cities-171654775.html">autonomous vehicles</a> were seen stuck in the middle of San Francisco streets following a significant power outage that took out the city&#39;s traffic lights. Waymo responded to the power outage by suspending its ride-hailing services in the city, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/walden_yan/status/2002567997794439501">images</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/WhereIsMishaal/status/2002587200681390318">videos</a> on social media showed the self-driving taxis stopped at intersections with hazard lights on.</p>
<p>&quot;We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,&quot; Suzanne Philion, a spokesperson for Waymo, told Engadget in an email. &quot;Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The power outage was attributed to a fire at one of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)&#39;s substations. The incident began sometime on Saturday morning, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/PGE4Me/status/2002534714389717370">PG&amp;E said</a> affected approximately 130,000 customers. As of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/PGE4Me/status/2002765351029739758?s=20">Sunday morning</a>, the Californian power company said its crews have restored power to about 110,000 of those customers, while working on the remaining 21,000 customers in &quot;the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate&nbsp;Park&nbsp;and&nbsp;small areas&nbsp;of downtown&nbsp;San Francisco.&quot;</p>
<p>Waymo hasn&#39;t provided an explanation as to why the power outage left its autonomous cars stranded in San Francisco streets, but this episode may have revealed a notable fault with the Waymo Driver system. Waymo indicates on its website that its autonomous driving system &quot;responds to signs and signals, like traffic light colors and temporary stop signs,&quot; which could indicate that the self-driving cars struggled with the out-of-order street lights. Tesla&#39;s CEO, Elon Musk, also saw an opportunity to chime in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2002774307659997582">on X</a>, posting that &quot;Tesla Robotaxis <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/TheEVuniverse/status/2002654772780781899">were unaffected</a> by the SF power outage.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-san-francisco-power-outage-left-waymos-self-driving-cars-stranded-at-intersections-172316970.html?src=rss
