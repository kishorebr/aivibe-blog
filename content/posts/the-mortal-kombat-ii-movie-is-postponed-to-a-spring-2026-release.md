<p>We&#39;ll have to wait until May to discover the fate of Earthrealm and Johnny Cage. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mortal-kombat-sequel-moon-night-writer-125051734.html"><em>Mortal Kombat II</em></a>, the sequel to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mortal-kombat-screenwriter-greg-russo-film-interview-193514008.html">2021&#39;s reboot</a> of the video game adaptation, will be pushed back from its original October 24 release date to May 15, 2026. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/MKMovie/status/1961557439574413342">post on X</a> from the movie&#39;s official account, the &quot;tournament demands a new time and place, worthy of its spectacle.&quot;</p>
<p>The delay goes against the trailer and promotional images that Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema already put out, but the studios may be banking on it as a way to maximize the sequel&#39;s potential success. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, the movie could avoid a crowded box office in October and instead perform better in a spring debut. The report added that a record-breaking red-band trailer that saw 106 million views in the first 24 hours and a strong performance in research screenings could have influenced the decision to reschedule.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Impatient fans will have to wait until next year for the sequel that stars Karl Urban as Johnny Cage. The trailer revealed a plot that will revolve heavily around Cage as he joins the fight-to-the-death tournament in order to save Earthrealm. As confusing as the Mortal Kombat <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/mortal-kombat-timeline-story-explained/">video game timeline</a> is, the reboot movies could be a more approachable alternative. Starting with the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie from 2021 and leading into the upcoming <em>Mortal Kombat II, </em>the story could end with a third film to close out a potential trilogy, as hinted by the movies&#39; writer, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://collider.com/mortal-kombat-movie-ending-explained/">Greg Russo</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-mortal-kombat-ii-movie-is-postponed-to-a-spring-2026-release-192515532.html?src=rss
