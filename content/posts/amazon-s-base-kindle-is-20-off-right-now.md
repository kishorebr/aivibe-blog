This is a nice discount of $20. It&#39;s not a record-low price, but it&#39;s certainly a budget-friendly way to keep that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-gear-to-help-you-stick-to-your-new-years-resolutions-130000389.html"><ins>New Year&#39;s resolution to read more</ins></a>.</p>

It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>
