<p>The iPad Pro with the M5 chip is expected to be just as easy to use for selfies in a landscape or portrait orientation. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple will add a second front-facing camera on the portrait edge of the upcoming <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-is-reportedly-on-track-to-launch-the-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-later-this-year-211013731.html">iPad Pro</a> that&#39;s expected to launch later this year. It may seem like a small quality-of-life upgrade, but it means the iPad Pro can use either camera to center the subject for selfies or FaceTime calls.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous iPad models, the upcoming iPad Pro with Apple&#39;s latest silicon removes the guessing game of where the front-facing camera is. In the past, iPad models only had one front-facing camera alongside the portrait edge, but Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-vs-2022-whats-changed-202056821.html">decided to shift</a> this to the landscape side in 2024 with the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-m4-hands-on-absurdly-thin-and-light-but-the-screen-steals-the-show-153641259.html">iPad Pro M4</a>. iPad Pro owners who mostly use their devices in landscape mode welcomed this change, but those who preferred holding it vertically found it was trickier to unlock through Face ID.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond the new front-facing camera, the new iPad Pro should have slight performance upgrades and better power efficiency thanks to the improved M5 chip. Besides the iPad Pro, Apple is reportedly looking at upgrading its Vision Pro, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac with its next-gen chips.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-next-ipad-pro-will-reportedly-get-two-front-facing-cameras-002042546.html?src=rss
