<p>After suggesting a version of AMD&#39;s FSR 4 could be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstations-mark-cerny-says-a-version-of-fsr-4-could-be-implemented-on-the-ps5-pro-191802108.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ported to the PS5 Pro</a> last year, it looks like Sony is finally rolling out an update with the upscaling tech in March. Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS4, PS5 and PS5 Pro, shared <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/27/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-is-coming-to-ps5-pro/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">via a blog post</a> that the PS5 Pro will be updated with a new version of the company&#39;s PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) upscaling tech next month, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-preview-150000849.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> is one of the first games to use it.</p><p>PSSR is &quot;an AI library that analyzes game images pixel by pixel as it upscales them,&quot; Cerny says, which boosts the visual fidelity of games on the PS5 Pro, while running them at a less demanding resolution. The upgraded version of PSSR &quot;takes a very different approach to not only the neural network but also the overall algorithm,&quot; and is now able to keep both framerate and image quality high when it&#39;s enabled.</p><p>Cerny&#39;s blog post includes comparison images if you&#39;re curious about the visual differences the new PSSR is able to achieve. Masaru Ijuin, a Senior Manager from Capcom&#39;s Engine Development Support Section R&amp;D Foundational Technology Department, also provided comments on how the new upscaling tech improves <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>:</p><blockquote><p>With <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, we focused on enhancing the presentation quality of the protagonist through an upgraded version of RE Engine to deepen the player’s immersion in horror. For example, each individual strand of hair and beard is rendered as a polygon, allowing it to move realistically in response to body motion and wind. The way light passes through his hair changes depending on how the strands of hair are overlapped as well. This detailed expression of texture is one of the many details that we would especially love for our fans to see.</p><p>The upgraded PSSR has allowed us to elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy. We hope you will experience this unprecedented level of horror and visual fidelity, and the new gameplay feel it delivers.</p></blockquote><p>Sony and AMD <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstations-mark-cerny-did-a-deep-dive-on-the-ps5-pro-and-sonys-new-partnership-with-amd-193613727.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">formally announced</a> &quot;Project Amethyst,&quot; their collaboration to develop machine-learning technology to improve graphics and gameplay, in 2024. The partnership has already benefitted both companies: Cerny says Sony contributed to the development of AMD&#39;s FSR 4 and similar improvements are now trickling back to the PS5 Pro. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-and-amd-tease-the-gpu-tech-theyre-building-for-the-next-playstation-172500942.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Both companies&#39; plans</a> to improve everything from upscaling performance to energy efficiency could also pay further dividends in future consoles and GPUs.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/972bb427abf83263cbd620377e02a6284602da82.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/972bb427abf83263cbd620377e02a6284602da82.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="The new toggle for the upgraded version of PSSR that&#39;s coming to PS5 Pro consoles." data-uuid="407ffb90-faa1-4f8f-af13-c8a10da489f5"/><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony Interactive Entertainment </div></figure><p>The upgraded PSSR will roll out to PS5 Pro owners as part of a software update in March, and will be able to be toggled on and off in the console&#39;s settings, according to Cerny. Around the same time, multiple PS5 games are also supposed to be updated to support the upscaling tech. While the graphical improvements are still incremental over a normal PS5, the fact that Sony&#39;s still squeezing more performance out of its console should at least be reassuring to anyone who spent $700 (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-raises-ps5-console-prices-in-the-us-153429564.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">or now $750</a>) on a PS5 Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-ps5-pro-is-getting-upgraded-upscaling-tech-in-march-200105816.html?src=rss
