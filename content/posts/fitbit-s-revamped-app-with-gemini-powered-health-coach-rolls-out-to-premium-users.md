Fitbit’s new Gemini-powered health coach, announced back in August, is becoming available as a public preview to Premium subscribers in the U.S. on Android starting tomorrow. It expands to iOS later this year. 

As the AI race heats up, Google is counting on the Gemini AI assistant to help Fitbit stand out from the crowd. Called “Coach,” this feature is designed to be your all-in-one fitness trainer, sleep coach, and health and wellness advisor.

At the recent Made by Google event, Google showcased Coach’s various capabilities, like how it can create a custom routine based on your goals, preferences, and available equipment. 


	
	




	
	



For example, if you want to run longer distances without becoming winded, Coach will create a tailored fitness plan with suggestions and achievable targets. While you work out, it’ll adjust your exercise plan in real time based on feedback to keep you on track. And if you happen to get injured later in the week, the AI will modify the plan accordingly.

Other capabilities include analyzing your sleep habits and providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality over time.

While the focus will be on Coach, the Fitbit app also features a makeover with a sleek design that’s easier to navigate, organized around four main tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health.

Google published a demo video on its Made by Google channel on YouTube that explains each tab. The Today tab, for instance, serves as the central hub of the app, highlighting key focus metrics, weekly cardio load data, and any other relevant statistics you may want to glance at quickly. You can manually customize which metrics you want to view at any time.
