<p>Last week, Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-launches-world-first-micro-rgb-tv-setting-new-standard-premium-tv-technology/"><ins>announced the world&#39;s first Micro RGB TV</ins></a> and while it sounded fantastic on paper, you can never really get a good sense of what a fresh display looks like until you see it in person. But after going to Samsung&#39;s new headquarters in New Jersey, I can attest that it is truly a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Now, before we get to the TV itself, it&#39;s probably a good idea to dive into what&#39;s going on with Samsung&#39;s latest panel tech. In many ways, Micro RGB is a step up from current Mini LED screens. On a technical level, the Micro LEDs and the self-emissive pixels of Samsung&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-wall-virtual-movie-studio-121524064.html">The Wall</a> probably remain the more sophisticated end goal for next-gen TVs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At its core, Micro RGB is still based on LCD tech, the difference is that instead of using blue or white backlighting like a lot of sets today, it features individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs (hence the name Micro RGB) to produce an even wider range of colors. The result is that Samsung claims this is the first TV to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 standard. For context, that covers more than 75 percent of the visible spectrum and has an even wider color range than what you get from DCI-P3, which is one of the most commonly used high-end standards for modern filmmaking.</p>

<p>In person, that means the TV can produce stunningly rich and vivid colors that put Samsung&#39;s other top-tier TVs to shame, including the new <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-super-big-tv-lineup-115-inch-neo-qled-4k-tv/"><ins>Neo QLED QN90F</ins></a> which starts at a whopping $26,999. Like its sibling, Samsung&#39;s Micro RGB TV is only available in one size (115 inches) and has a similar design, while its panel features a 144Hz refresh rate and a matte glare-free coating. But that&#39;s kind of where the similarities end, because this new flagship model features four times the number of dimming zones. Furthermore, because the Micro RGB LEDs require more computing power to manage all those pixels, Samsung had to create a new RGB Engine AI processor to properly control everything.</p>
<p>In short, this is a lot of words to describe what might be the best-looking TV I&#39;ve ever seen. While I only got to view some demo footage (which admittedly is designed to make the set look its best), I couldn&#39;t help but appreciate the sheer intensity of the hues and shades on display. When the video loop shifted to primarily blue and green scenes, the TV&#39;s color depth was almost overwhelming. That said, due to the immense size of the panel, when you get up close, it&#39;s easy to see individual pixels. However, when you&#39;re sitting in its sweet spot (about 11.5 feet from the display), everything looks ridiculously sharp and overflows with detail. And even for those off-center, there appeared to be no falloff in brightness or saturation.</p>

<p>Now, of course, the major downside of Samsung&#39;s new Micro RGB TV is that at $29,999, it makes everything but The Wall (which starts at a cool $40,000) seem cheap. But the funny thing is that when compared to the Neo QLED QN90F, which Samsung also had on display in a nearby room, the difference in quality and color was immediately obvious. This sort of makes me wonder why anyone with super deep pockets would even consider the latter just to save a few thousand dollars, because when you see them in person, there&#39;s no doubt which set is superior.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Micro RGB&#39;s full glory doesn&#39;t translate across the internet due to the much more limited specs of the web. It&#39;s one of those things you need to see for yourself to fully grasp. But if you&#39;re the kind of person with enough money that you don&#39;t need to care about price tags, Samsung&#39;s latest flagship should be an immediate contender as the centerpiece in your mansion.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html?src=rss
