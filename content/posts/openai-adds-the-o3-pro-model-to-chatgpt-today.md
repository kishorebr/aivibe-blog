<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/openai/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="OpenAI" data-original-link="">OpenAI</a> is keeping up its rapid-fire pace of new AI releases. The company introduced the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-o3-and-o4-mini-models-are-all-about-thinking-with-images-170043465.html"><ins>o3 and o4-mini models</ins></a> to its ChatGPT platform in April. At the time, the business promised that a pro model of the o3 was on the way, and that version became available today.</p>
<p>Both the o3 and o4-mini models are meant to use and combine all the tools under ChatGPT&#39;s umbrella. When OpenAI adds the &quot;pro&quot; designation to a model, it&#39;s a version that has been built to spend longer answering queries to provide better and more accurate responses. &quot;We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes"><ins>said</ins></a> in the release notes for the o3-pro. In the testing assessments shared, the o3-pro delivered better benchmarks than the o3 and the o1-pro options.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are some restrictions on the other ChatGPT services the o3-pro can use. Image generation and Canvas are not supported, so users will need to turn to different models for those features. The o3-pro is available today for ChatGPT Pro and Team users, while Enterprise and Edu customers will have access to this option next week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-adds-the-o3-pro-model-to-chatgpt-today-212126136.html?src=rss
