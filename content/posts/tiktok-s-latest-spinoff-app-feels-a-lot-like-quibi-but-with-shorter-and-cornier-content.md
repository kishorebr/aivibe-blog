<p>In another attempt to reduce our attention spans to mush, TikTok has released the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinedrama/id6754134922">PineDrama</a> app, which offers serialized drama series that are roughly a minute per episode. As first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-launches-a-new-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama-2026-1"><em>Business Insider</em></a>, the app is designed exactly like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html">TikTok</a>, but instead of trendy dance videos, you can scroll through and watch &quot;micro dramas.&quot;</p>
<p>For those new to the category, micro dramas are bite-sized TV shows shot in vertical video and available in minute-long episodes. Don&#39;t expect any nominations for Best Original Screenplay with series like <em>The Officer Fell For Me </em>or<em> Married to my past life&#39;s nemesis</em>, since they typically offer soap opera vibes with cliffhangers that keep users scrolling to the next episode. The app is designed to keep people on it with a Discover tab, a place to save favorites and the ability to react in real time alongside other viewers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Right now, the micro dramas on PineDrama are all free to watch and don&#39;t have any ads. It&#39;s unclear if TikTok will introduce any costs or ads to the app, since other micro drama options like DramaBox or ReelShort have a paid structure. Late last year, TikTok also introduced a way to watch micro dramas within its own app, with a section called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-jumps-into-micro-dramas-buzzy-bite-sized-soaps-2025-12">Minis</a>. It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;re seeing shorter TV show formats, since Quibi made waves with a format of episodes that were less than 10 minutes long. However, maybe even 10 minutes was too long since the startup eventually <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-shut-down-155124687.html">called it quits</a> after eight months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tiktoks-latest-spinoff-app-feels-a-lot-like-quibi-but-with-shorter-and-cornier-content-185702010.html?src=rss
