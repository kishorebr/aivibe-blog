<p>Motorola just announced its very first side-foldable smartphone, joining the ranks of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. The Razr Fold boasts an impressive 6.6-inch external screen and an 8.1-inch flexible main display. The company hasn&#39;t provided dimensions, so we don&#39;t know how thick it is.</p>
<p>We do know, however, that it&#39;ll include support for the Moto Pen Ultra stylus. This is actually a fairly big deal, as Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/unpacked-2025-s-pen-shocker-galaxy-z-fold-7-loses-compatibility-with-stylus">dropped the feature for the Z Fold 7</a>. Modern foldables basically double as tablets, so a stylus is always appreciated.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a robust camera system here, with a 50MP Sony sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro, a 50MP telephoto, a 32MP external selfie lens and a 20MP internal camera. It also offers the ability to record in Dolby Vision.</p>
<p>The Razr Fold will be available in blue and white. We don&#39;t have any information regarding internal specs, pricing or availability. Motorola says that &quot;more specifications will be shared in the coming months.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that while this is the company&#39;s first side-folding camera, Motorola has always made top-folding phones. After all, that&#39;s what a flip phone is. The company continues to refine this basic idea with its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html">standard Razr line</a> of midrange top-folding smartphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-just-announced-a-foldable-phone-to-rival-samsung-and-google-at-ces-010015323.html?src=rss
