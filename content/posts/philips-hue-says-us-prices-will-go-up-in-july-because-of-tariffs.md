<p>When Philips Hue’s US prices go up next month, you can officially know who to blame. (Hint: It rhymes with "rump.") Parent company Signify told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://hueblog.com/2025/06/24/philips-hue-to-raise-prices-in-the-us-from-july-1/"><em>Hueblog</em></a> (<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692130/philips-hue-us-tariffs-smart-lighting-price-increase">via</a> <em>The Verge</em>) that its price increases are "a direct result of tariffs." See how easy that was, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-denies-report-that-it-plans-to-show-tariff-impacts-on-its-prices-144320278.html">Amazon</a>?</p>
<p>Before that confirmation, the company vaguely referred to an upcoming price increase. "Hurry, prices go up on July 1," marketing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://m.news.philips-hue.com/rest/head/mirrorPage/@Md9FTvAtVg4CA6vCkffTyQDWFUrxsgjB-na8EyccRdCKEs81mM2K6SKa7212pWO-y3LucuTpA1YTCrwZLodS_ibQDvwvOtgBo_3gwlFcxLbIHgpn.html">copy</a> from earlier this month stated.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Signify’s statement to <em>Hueblog</em> doesn’t mince words about <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/us-and-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days-120050454.html">Trump’s trade war</a> being the culprit. "Signify will increase prices on our Philips Hue portfolio in the US, effective July 1, 2025, as a direct result of tariffs," it wrote. "We remain committed to providing consumers with high-quality products and features that make smart lighting extraordinary. Signify reserves the right to modify prices based on new or additional tariffs becoming effective in the future."</p>
<p>We don’t yet know the exact price increases. The company says it will reveal them when they take effect on July 1. But there are some hints. The newly upgraded Hue smart button costs $32 compared to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-phillips-unveils-new-hue-smart-button-and-upgraded-go-lamp.html">the old model’s</a> $25. If you think that’s because it’s a new version, the product stayed at the same €21.99 as its predecessor in Europe. Up to this point, the company’s US pricing had been around a 1:1 conversion.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/philips-hue-says-us-prices-will-go-up-in-july-because-of-tariffs-183434777.html?src=rss
