<p>Indie game developer Edmund McMillen hosted a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pj8wqu/edmund_mcmillen_here_creator_of_the_binding_of/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Reddit AMA</a> today offering some more details about his upcoming game <em>Mewgenics</em>. For starters, the Steam release date for this turn-based cat-breeding RPG has been slightly delayed to February 10. The game was first announced all the way back in 2012 and had most recently been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-creator-of-binding-of-isaac-will-release-a-new-game-mewgenics-this-year-211049653.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">slated</a> for a launch some time this year. Part of the long development cycle was so that McMillen could pause to launch <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-31-super-meat-boy-forever-trims-fat-cooks-up-huge-challenge.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Super Meat Boy Forever</em></a>, the sequel to his <em>Super Meat Boy</em> platforming hit from 2010. Gamers may also know McMillen for <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, which has had some notable crossovers with titles <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/your-balatro-deck-can-now-feature-binding-of-isaac-characters-191009810.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">like <em>Balatro</em></a> in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other tidbits from the AMA include the promise that McMillen already has DLC ideas, so expect to have additional content release after the base game is available. Although there doesn&#39;t seem to be any lack of replayability in Mewgenics; McMillen said &quot;I currently have 300+ hours across 2 saves and have only beaten the game on one save so far.&quot; There is also a plan to have some console versions of the game, although likely not until much later next year at the soonest, the dev added.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mewgenics-the-next-game-from-the-binding-of-isaacs-developer-will-arrive-next-february-on-pc-235740063.html?src=rss
