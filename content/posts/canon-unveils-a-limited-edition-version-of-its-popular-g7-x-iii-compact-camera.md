To celebrate that 30-year anniversary, the company has unveiled a Limited Edition version of its still-popular PowerShot G7 X III compact camera. It has a few unique touches but is otherwise the same as the original model released nearly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-g5-x-ii-cameras.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">seven years ago</a>.</p><p>The limited edition model has a new “graphite” color with a knurled front ring designed to exude “luxury and quality,” Canon wrote. It also carries 30 year anniversary logo printed on the body “to create a special feeling suitable for limited edition models,” the company added in the most Canon-y way possible. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-camera.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-camera.jpg" style="height:953px;width:1750px;" alt="Canon&#39;s Limited Edition PowerShot G7 X III compact camera" data-uuid="6bd9144f-722a-472b-9f30-8c60f413a32d"><figcaption>Canon&#39;s Limited Edition PowerShot G7 X III compact camera</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>As a reminder, the G7 X III was one of the first cameras <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-g5-x-ii-cameras.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">announced specifically</a> as a model for vloggers, thanks to its ability to shoot vertical video for Instagram. It features a 20.1MP sensor, flip-up 3-inch touchscreen, 24-100mm f/1.8-2.8 zoom lens and a microphone input. It supports 4K 30 fps video with no cropping and can shoot 1080p at 120 fps. The <em>piece de resistance</em> is direct streaming to YouTube directly over Wi-Fi, then a new thing but now a common feature. It originally retailed for $749. </p><p>The G7 X III had been in short supply until recently, but used models became popular with influencers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/this-odd-camera-is-trending-and-it-shows-that-camera-brands-dont-understand-what-influencers-want" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">several years ago</a> and started selling way above list price. Possibly because of that viral fame, Canon announced in August 2025 that it was increasing production and the G7 X III started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/compact-cameras/stop-overpaying-for-the-trendy-canon-powershot-g7x-mark-iii-this-viral-compact-camera-is-finally-showing-signs-of-returning-to-stock-at-list-price" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">returning to stock</a> a few months later priced at $880. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-limited-edition.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-limited-edition.jpg" style="height:773px;width:1630px;" alt="Canon&#39;s Limited Edition PowerShot G7 X III compact camera" data-uuid="96f5fe8d-dbcd-4b3c-9039-cd3d78703406"><figcaption>Canon&#39;s Limited Edition PowerShot G7 X III compact camera</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The Limited Edition G7 X III is selling for a lot more than that at $1,299, though it does come with a limited edition Peak Design cuff wrist strap and 32GB SD card. If you want to one-up the influencers and grab one, shipping will start in April 2026. </p><p>Along with the camera, Canon announced a pair of interesting new RF-mount full-frame lenses. The first is the ultra wide angle RF 14mm f/1.4 L VCM prime model priced at $2,599, promising bright, high quality optics. The other is a very interesting $1,899 RF7-14mm f/2.8-3.5 L Fisheye STM zoom lens with up to a 190 degree perspective at the widest setting. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-unveils-a-limited-edition-version-of-its-popular-g7-x-iii-compact-camera-040000700.html?src=rss
