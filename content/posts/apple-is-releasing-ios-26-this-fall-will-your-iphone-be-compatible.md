The reports of a numbering scheme change were true — <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-rumored-to-release-ios-26-not-ios-19-at-wwdc-2025-193424610.html">iOS 18 is skipping to iOS 26</a> — but there were a laundry list of actual usability changes shown off, as well as the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a>, which looks to be Apple&#39;s largest visual update in years. But the biggest question we&#39;re all wondering: Will my iPhone be able to run iOS 26?</p>
<p>Last year, Apple didn&#39;t nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that&#39;s not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won&#39;t be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what&#39;s coming with the latest OS and more, here&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html">everything announced at Apple&#39;s WWDC event today</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike last year, several iPhone models won&#39;t be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won&#39;t be coming to the iOS 26 party:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iPhone XR</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone XS</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone XS Max</p></li>

<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn&#39;t supported by iOS 26, that&#39;s fine. However, you&#39;ll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won&#39;t be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-when-will-ios-26-become-available">When will iOS 26 become available?</h2>
<p>Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at that iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html"><strong>Liquid Glass design</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You&#39;ll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple&#39;s OSes more cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You&#39;ll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that&#39;ll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you&#39;re meeting at this weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-will-your-iphone-be-compatible-191854628.html?src=rss
