<p>CES has long felt like a full-on auto show, but the car-centric energy seems somewhat muted at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a>. Sure, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html">Afeela electric vehicle</a> from the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html">Sony-Honda joint venture</a> is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html">yanking most EV incentives</a> from the market, the industry isn&#39;t offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there&#39;s no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2026/holographic-windshield-display/">Holographic Windshield Display</a><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">. </a></p>
<p>Indeed, the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-mobis-to-unveil-30-new-technologies-at-ces-2026-aiming-to-strengthen-global-oem-partnerships-302635135.html">Mobis subsidiary</a> will present &quot;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&quot; during CES. And we&#39;ll also get to see Hyundai&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001093">AI Robotics Strategy</a>, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.</p>

<p>Hyundai&#39;s presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hyundai/streams">HyundaiUSA YouTube channel</a> or its <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HyundaiMotorGroup">global YouTube channel</a>. We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It&#39;s essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle&#39;s dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver&#39;s view. It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.</p>
<p>Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &quot;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&quot; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.</p>
<p>Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-acquires-boston-dynamics-1-1-billion-110901223.html">purchased by the Korean multinational</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&quot; the company said in the same press release.</p>
<p>Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss
