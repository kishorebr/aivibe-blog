<p>Facebook is once again rebranding the "video" section of its app. This time, the tab formerly known as "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-redesigned-video-tab-emphasizes-reels-and-recommendations-150059104.html"><ins>video</ins></a>," which was also once called "<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-09-facebook-watch-tv-video.html"><ins>watch</ins></a>," will become "reels." The change comes as the company says that all video on the social network will now fall under the umbrella of "reels" regardless of how long the clip is or how it was shot.</p>
<p>According <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/making-it-easier-create-videos-facebook/"><ins>to Meta</ins></a>, the change will make things simpler for users and creators sharing video clips on the platform. Previously, users had to decide whether they wanted a given video to be a "reel," shorter clips that are recommended throughout the Facebook app, or a "video," which also included live and longer-form content, as well as video posts intended only for friends. Now, that distinction will no longer matter.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While reels was once explicitly meant for shortform videos of one minute or less, Meta has gradually expanded the format. On Instagram, Reels can now be up to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-swoops-in-with-3-minute-reels-and-rectangular-profile-grids-as-the-tiktok-ban-gets-real-201316339.html"><ins>three minutes</ins></a> long. On Facebook, there will be no upper limit on how long a "reel" can be. "You’ll be able to create and share reels of any length or orientation, whether it’s a quick, 30-second vertical clip or an in-depth, 20-minute plus horizontal episode," Meta <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://creators.facebook.com/blog/making-it-easier-to-create-videos-on-facebook"><ins>explains</ins></a>.</p>
<p>This change could end up being slightly confusing as most people are used to "reels" being shorter, vertical clips rather than long "episodes." It's also notably different from how video functions on Instagram, where reels still have time constraints. It could also raise questions from a privacy standpoint as reels are typically public posts, while many Facebook users upload video they only want to share with their existing friends (Meta says it will prompt users to revisit their privacy settings once the change rolls out to ensure their clips only make it to the intended audience.)</p>
<p>Meta notes that the changes will be rolling out slowly "in the coming months," so people will have some time to adjust to the new format.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-videos-are-all-just-going-to-be-reels-now-185807805.html?src=rss
