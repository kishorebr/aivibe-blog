Though they’re not a Major League team, the Oakland Ballers – coyly, the Oakland B’s – established an unprecedented national community of fans who rallied around the team in protest of the A’s departure.

“The Oakland Ballers uniquely have the experience of being like a major league team in a minor league market,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “We can have creative flexibility. We can play with things and experiment with things way before the MLB or NBA or any of those leagues could do something.”

Minor league baseball organizations are often called upon to test new technology before it gets implemented in the majors, like chall
