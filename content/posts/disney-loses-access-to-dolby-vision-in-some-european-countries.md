<p>Disney+ subscribers in some European countries have lost access to advanced HDR features like Dolby Vision, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/disney-plus/disney-has-lost-dolby-vision-and-hdr10-in-some-countries-and-the-us-could-be-next-it-says-technical-challenges-but-a-report-says-patents-are-to-blame" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>TechRadar</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1770375204" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>FlatpanelsHD</em></a> report. The issue was first spotted by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1pt5fqa/removing_dolby_vision_without_even_an/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">German Disney+ subscribers on Reddit</a>, but currently also impacts subscribers in Portugal, Poland, France and the Netherlands, according to <em>FlatpanelsHD</em>.</p><p>&quot;Dolby Vision support for content on Disney+ is currently unavailable in several European countries due to technical challenges,&quot; Disney said in a statement. &quot;We are actively working to restore access to Dolby Vision and will provide an update as soon as possible. 4K UHD and HDR support remain available on supported devices.&quot;</p><p>If the issue is in fact a technical one, it seems like it could be around for the long-term. Disney has removed any reference to Dolby Vision from its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/article/disneyplus-video-quality" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Disney+ video quality support page in Germany</a>. As of now, the company lists HDR10 as its default HDR format, despite <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dolby.com/experience/home-entertainment/articles/disney-in-dolby-vision/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Dolby Vision support</a> being a feature of Disney+ for several years now.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FlatpanelsHD</em> writes that the real issue might be legal, rather than technological. A company called InterDigital <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.interdigital.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2025/InterDigital-awarded-injunction-against-Disney-by-German-court/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">won an injunction in a German court</a> against Disney in November 2025 because it violated at least one of the company&#39;s patents on streaming video technology. The injunction specifically requires Disney to stop violating InterDigital&#39;s patent on &quot;a method for dynamically overlaying a first video stream with a second video stream comprising, for example, subtitles.&quot; It&#39;s not entirely clear how that plays into the company offering Dolby Vision in Europe, but it would explain why subscribers in Germany were some of the first people to notice Dolby Vision&#39;s absence.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Disney for more information about Disney+&#39;s missing HDR support and whether InterDigital&#39;s injunction played a role. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>Mentions of Dolby Vision were also stripped out of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-video-quality" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">the US version</a> of Disney+&#39;s video quality support page. InterDigital hasn&#39;t won an injunction in the US, but the company is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69604250/1/interdigital-inc-v-the-walt-disney-company/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">pursuing a patent case</a> against Disney in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean Dolby Vision support will be taken from US subscribers next, but it does suggest there&#39;s more happening here than just technical challenges.</p><p><strong>Update, February 6, 3:44PM ET:</strong> The original version of this article included mention of Disney+ losing HDR10+ support in Europe, but Disney says it never offered HDR10+ in that region. The article has been updated accordingly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-loses-access-to-dolby-vision-in-some-european-countries-193930702.html?src=rss
