<p>Samsung is hosting another Unpacked event on September 4, and this time it&#39;ll only be available to watch virtually. The event will stream on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/samsung__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!BLe2PrCQEjy3A2WxNXy55mLBDAVW5os3yZalhmMt3DYR526_9ICvjKupAEunPTi4Xgv1zX27pY-G-59UCrX3o2Yzmw$"><ins>Samsung&#39;s YouTube page</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.samsung.com/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!BLe2PrCQEjy3A2WxNXy55mLBDAVW5os3yZalhmMt3DYR526_9ICvjKupAEunPTi4Xgv1zX27pY-G-59UCrWBgtAj5g$"><ins>website</ins></a> at 5:30AM ET, following the in-person launch events the company held for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-hands-on-180017460.html"><ins>Galaxy S25 line</ins></a> in January and the new <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-the-big-design-revamp-weve-been-waiting-for-140049475.html"><ins>Galaxy Z Fold 7</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-bigger-screens-bigger-battery-better-foldable-140008222.html"><ins>Z Flip 7</ins></a> in July.</p>
<p>With most of the company&#39;s smartphone lineup accounted for, Samsung will likely use this Unpacked to introduce new tablets. The company announced the the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/samsungs-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-and-galaxy-tab-s10-are-tablets-built-for-ai-162633747.html"><ins>Galaxy Tab S10 Lite</ins></a> earlier this week and now leaks point to a new Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra being in the works, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-and-S11-Ultra-Leak-reveals-pricing-of-upcoming-flagship-Android-tablets.1094413.0.html"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Notebookcheck</ins></em></a><em><ins>. </ins></em>The Tab S11 will reportedly feature an AMOLED screen, 12GB of RAM and a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip, rather than Samsung&#39;s preferred Qualcomm Snapdragon chips. The Tab S11 Ultra will have similar features, but with a larger AMOLED, up to 16GB of RAM, the same MediaTek chip and a larger 11,600mAh battery.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Odds are also good that Samsung will announce the Galaxy S25 FE, a cheaper alternative to the normal Galaxy S25. Based on the leaks <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-fe-three-big-upgrades-confirmed-leak/"><em><ins>SamMobile</ins></em><ins> compiled</ins></a>, the S25 FE will share many similarities with the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review-a-great-phone-but-i-wish-it-was-cheaper-190032655.html"><ins>S24 FE</ins></a>, save for an improved 12MP selfie camera, up from 10MP on the S24 FE, a larger 4,900mAh battery and faster wired charging speeds.</p>
<p>Provided you&#39;re willing to get up early, you&#39;ll be able to see for yourself when Samsung streams its next Unpacked event on September 4. It likely won&#39;t be the last event the company holds this year, either.
