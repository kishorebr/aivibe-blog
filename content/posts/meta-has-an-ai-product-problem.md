In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.  

Those figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous.

If his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. 

It’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was
