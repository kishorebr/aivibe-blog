Apple is in talks to use Google’s Gemini for Siri revamp, report says


Apple is falling behind in the race to transform Siri into an AI assistant that’s as powerful as its competitors. As consumers grow more impatient, Apple is considering using another company’s tech instead of developing its own.

Apple is now exploring a partnership with Google, its most direct competitor in the smartphone business, according to Bloomberg editor and Apple insider Mark Gurman.


	
	




	
	



The company previously approached OpenAI and Anthropic for similar discussions about using their technology to power Siri, and reportedly, Google has begun training a model that could run on Apple’s servers.

Apple is not expected to make a decision about whether to bring on a partner for the Siri revamp for another several weeks.
