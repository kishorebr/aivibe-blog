<p>Blizzard developers working on <em>Hearthstone</em> and <em>Warcraft Rumble</em> have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hearthstone-and-warcraft-rumble-developers-form-union-communications-workers-america" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">formed a new union</a>, the latest in a series of labor wins at the Microsoft-owned studio. The over 100-person unit is represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), and counts &quot;software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers and producers&quot; among its members.</p><p>Inspiration to form the new union came from the successful organizing efforts of Blizzard&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/world-of-warcraft-workers-unlock-form-a-union-achievement-220148151.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>World of Warcraft</em> workers</a> last year. The staff behind the classic MMO formed the Warcraft Gamemakers Guild last year, and were followed by similar unions representing developers working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/over-450-diablo-developers-at-blizzard-have-unionized-180544383.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Diablo</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-developers-behind-overwatch-have-unionized-154021756.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Overwatch</em></a> earlier in 2025. According to the CWA, over 1,900 workers at Blizzard are now represented by the organization.</p><p>The new union is arriving at a critical time. Blizzard&#39;s parent company Microsoft made major cuts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">across its gaming division</a> this summer, including layoffs that reportedly led to Blizzard <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzard-is-giving-up-on-its-warcraft-mobile-game-amid-layoffs-215021940.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">winding down development</a> on <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>. Union membership has flourished across Microsoft&#39;s studios because of neutrality agreements the company signed with CWA respecting its workers&#39; right to organize at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-unionization-agreement-cwa-163550095.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Activision Blizzard in 2022</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-cwa-forge-labor-neutrality-agreement-covering-all-zenimax-workers-212643324.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ZeniMax in 2024</a>, but the environment is on the brink of possible change.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>Aftermath </em>reports</a> that the neutrality agreement covering Activision Blizzard workers expires in October 2025, which could make forming future unions more difficult.
