<p>Apple is going after another one of its previous employees for allegedly sharing trade secrets with a new employer. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/905036579/Apple-Inc-v-Shi-et-al">Apple&#39;s lawsuit</a> listed Chen Shi, a former employee who worked on the Apple Watch team, along with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-oppo-find-n5-hands-on-release-date-price-120058154.html">Oppo</a>, as defendants, claiming they &quot;conspired to steal Apple’s trade secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Shi worked as a Sensor System Architect for the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-features-a-much-larger-screen-and-a-much-thinner-design-171307821.html">Apple Watch</a> from January 2020 to June 2025, but was seeking employment with Oppo as early as April 2025. Apple claimed that its former employee didn&#39;t disclose that he was leaving to join Oppo and instead said he was going back to China to look after his elderly parents and didn&#39;t have any plans to find a new job. However, the lawsuit said that Shi &quot;set up and attended dozens of one-on-one meetings&quot; with Apple Watch team members to learn about their work on &quot;optical sensors, temperature sensors, and ECG sensors.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the lawsuit, Shi allegedly downloaded 63 files from one of Apple&#39;s protected folders and transferred the material to a USB drive before searching the internet for &quot;how to wipe out [a] macbook&quot; and &quot;can somebody see if I’ve opened a file on a shared drive?” Along with these claims, Apple said in the lawsuit that Shi sent a message to his future Oppo employers that he would &quot;collect as much information as possible&quot; about Apple&#39;s health-sensing technologies.</p>
<p>Oppo has since provided a statement to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/23/oppo-responds-to-apple-lawsuit/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> about Apple&#39;s lawsuit, claiming that it has &quot;found no evidence establishing any connection between these allegations and the employee&#39;s conduct during his employment at OPPO.&quot; The company statement also said that OPPO has not &quot;misappropriated Apple&#39;s trade secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time that Apple has taken legal action against one of its former employees. Earlier this summer, the company sued a design engineer, alleging that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-claims-former-engineer-shared-vision-pro-secrets-in-new-lawsuit-144914706.html">he stole trade secrets</a> about the Vision Pro and shared them with his new employer, Snap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-claims-an-ex-employee-stole-apple-watch-trade-secrets-for-oppo-182636187.html?src=rss
