<p>OpenAI may have called GPT-5.2 its &quot;most advanced frontier model for professional work,&quot; but tests conducted by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/latest-chatgpt-model-uses-elon-musks-grokipedia-as-source-tests-reveal"><em>Guardian</em></a> cast doubt on its credibility. According to the report, OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2 model cited <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-grokipedia-is-online-after-it-briefly-crashed-out-231108836.html">Grokipedia</a>, the online encyclopedia powered by xAI, when it came to specific, but controversial topics related to Iran or the Holocaust.</p>
<p>As seen in the <em>Guardian</em>&#39;s report, ChatGPT used Grokipedia as a source for claims about the Iranian government being tied to telecommunications company MTN-Irancell and questions related to Richard Evans, a British historian who served as an expert witness during a libel trial for Holocaust denier David Irving. However, the <em>Guardian</em> noted ChatGPT didn&#39;t use Grokipedia when it came to a prompt asking about media bias against Donald Trump and other controversial topics.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OpenAI released the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html">GPT-5.2 model</a> in December to better perform at professional use, like creating spreadsheets or handling complex tasks. Grokipedia preceded GPT-5.2&#39;s release, but ran into some controversy when it was seen <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/authorities-probe-holocaust-denial-responses-from-xs-grok-155835701.html">including citations</a> to neo-Nazi forums. A study done by US researchers also showed that the AI-generated encyclopedia <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251114-musk-s-grokipedia-leans-on-questionable-sources-study-says">cited</a> &quot;questionable&quot; and &quot;problematic&quot; sources.</p>
<p>In response to the <em>Guardian</em> report, OpenAI told the outlet that its GPT-5.2 model searches the web for a &quot;broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints,&quot; but applies &quot;safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/report-reveals-that-openais-gpt-52-model-cites-grokipedia-192532977.html?src=rss
