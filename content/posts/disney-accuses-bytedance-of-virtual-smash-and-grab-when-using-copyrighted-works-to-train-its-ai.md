<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html">Disney</a> is going after another generative AI tool, accusing ByteDance and its recently released Seedance 2.0 of using its copyrighted material without permission. As first reported on by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance"><em>Axios</em></a>, the Walt Disney Company sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, claiming the Chinese company developed its Seedance tool &quot;with a pirated library of Disney&#39;s copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney&#39;s coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter, which was obtained by <em>Axios</em>, included examples of Seedance videos featuring copyrighted Disney characters, including Spider-Man, Darth Vader, Peter Griffin and more. Even though ByteDance just released <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/bytedances-new-ai-video-model-goes-viral-china-looks-second-deepseek-moment-2026-02-12/">Seedance 2.0</a> on Thursday, it&#39;s already earned praise, but also indignation from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/hollywood-isnt-happy-about-the-new-seedance-2-0-video-generator/">Hollywood studios</a>, when it comes to its AI-generating capabilities.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the strong early momentum, Seedance has already found itself in hot water with one of the largest media companies in the world. However, it&#39;s not the first time that Disney has threatened legal action against an AI company, since <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-characterai-220204094.html">Character.AI</a> received a cease-and-desist letter for the same offense in September. A few months later, Disney even accused <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html">Google</a> of copyright infringement when training its AI models. On the other hand, Disney partnered with OpenAI in a three-year <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html">licensing agreement</a> that allows the AI giant to generate images and videos using that highly sought-after intellectual property.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-accuses-bytedance-of-virtual-smash-and-grab-when-using-copyrighted-works-to-train-its-ai-191116136.html?src=rss
