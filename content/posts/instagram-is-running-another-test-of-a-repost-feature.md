<p>Instagram is testing a new repost feature. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/instagram-tests-a-reposts-feature/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported that social media network is currently running a test that gives users the opportunity to repost content. The current feature test is focused on resharing a post, the content that appears in a user's feed, as a new post. The platform does already offer the ability to share a post to someone's Story, but this post-to-post repost would be a new addition to the available interactions. A rep from Meta confirmed that the tests are happening, but declined to add any additional comments.</p>
<p>Instagram did a very similar test of a very similar feature <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-about-to-start-testing-a-repost-feature-with-select-users-104335702.html">in 2022</a> and also trialed a repost button all the way back <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-29-instagram-testing-new-features-repost-button.html">in 2017</a>. Considering the company has made multiple attempts at an idea that's already well-established on other social networks, it seems surprising that the platform would once again revisit this idea. Between posts, Stories, Reels and DMs, Instagram already has a lot of unique content types. On the one hand, there are plenty of ways to share and resurface content, either your own or another account's to the feed. On the other hand, though, having different rules about what material can be shared to which format can put users in confusing situations.</p>
