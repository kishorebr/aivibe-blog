The Trump administration wants its AI technology to be considered an industry leader both on home soil and abroad. But it also doesn’t want the U.S.’s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary.

That’s quite the balance to strike.


	
	




	
	



If President Trump’s AI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals.

“​​America currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,” the plan stated. “It is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.”

The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through “creative approaches” followed by a pair of policy recommendations.

The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn’t a focus on many of the component subsystems — a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention.

The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies.
