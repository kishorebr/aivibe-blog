<p>Fall is just around the corner, which means we're in the midst of flagship phone season. Most recently, Google debuted its new Pixel lineup, offering multiple models where AI features take center stage. We've already put those devices through their paces, in addition to the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html">best noise-canceling earbuds</a> you can buy and a Sony camera. Read on to catch up on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/">reviews</a> you might've missed over the last few weeks.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl">Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="baf0ed76283647d5a9c46dd8919d7f4d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTT2J6N/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>If you've never really felt like your "smartphone" was all that "smart," senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued that Google has finally achieved the feat. Arguably, the best aspects of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL come down to their AI features, especially Google's Magic Cue. "Now that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever," <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html">he said.</a> "For the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, the company has combined iterative hardware upgrades with a solid (and attractive) design while its software and AI continues to outpace its rivals."</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="6101ec556d8c48c9a38a6a82f1f699e6" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>If the Pixel 10 Pro duo is finally putting the "smart" in "smartphone," UK bureau chief Mat Smith concluded that the Pixel 10 has redefined base-level flagship phones. A more capable camera, more power and Qi2 support mean you might not be as tempted by those pricer models. "The Pixel 10 is a substantial upgrade from the Pixel 9, although given it has the Tensor G5 chip, it’s a shame that software features like Zoom Enhance from last year’s Pixels didn’t make the cut," <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html">he said.</a> "Unless you’re a die-hard smartphone gamer, there isn’t a more capable smartphone at this price."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="5723e2d1f21e4e33b8f3bab956f6474f" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen/QCUE2-HEADPHONEIN.html"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The second-generation of Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds aren't a complete overhaul, but they didn't necessarily need to be. The company strengthened its already outstanding active noise cancellation while enhancing call clarity and making several other adjustments. "Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon," <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html">I said.</a></p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-sony-rx1r-iii">Sony RX1R III</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="6b5786ca9d064ce291c6be489d3dc28d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHM4GDGC"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Sometimes the wait for a new model can be excruciating. That anticipation turns to disappointment when the long-awaited update doesn't impress. That's how senior reporter Igor Bonifacic felt when he finally got his hands on the RX1R III. "It’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras," <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-rx1r-iii-review-waiting-10-years-to-be-underwhelmed-160036397.html">he said.</a> "I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend."</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-pixel-10-phones-bose-earbuds-and-a-sony-camera-130051534.html?src=rss
