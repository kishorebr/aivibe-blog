<p>Anyone who&#39;s been paying even a little bit of attention to tech news lately could have made a reasonable guess that AI will be a big topic at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-on-february-25-130000524.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Samsung&#39;s Unpacked</a> next week. Ahead of the event, Samsung teased some of what&#39;s to come for AI in terms of the Galaxy S26 smartphone lineup&#39;s photography tools.&nbsp;</p><p>The S26 phones will feature a new camera system using Galaxy AI that combines capturing, editing and sharing of photos and videos. &quot;Users will be able to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result,&quot; a company rep said. The video clips Samsung shared demonstrated the before and after results of using its AI tools, which will all be housed in a single app rather than needing to switch between multiple image editing programs.</p><p>Updated cameras are just part of what will be on the schedule for Samsung&#39;s big mobile showcase. The expected Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have a lot of AI-centric features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-teases-mobile-ai-photography-tools-ahead-of-unpacked-233000358.html?src=rss
