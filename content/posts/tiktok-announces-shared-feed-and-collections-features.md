<p>TikTok just <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/new-ways-for-friends-and-families-to-discover-share-and-connect-on-tiktok?lang=en">announced a couple of updates</a> that that should make the app a bit more social. There&#39;s something called Shared Feed, which is exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s a feed that friends and family can watch together, though at different times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feed is shared via direct messaging and pulls up relevant content to everyone involved in the chat. TikTok says this is a &quot;new way to discover content together.&quot; It consists of a daily curated selection of 15 videos that are generated by TikTok activity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These feeds are shared via invitation and the participants can leave the chat at any time. There&#39;s also a new dashboard that lets viewers check out their Shared Like history and other metrics. The Shared Feed tool rolls out globally in the coming months. It sounds similar to something Instagram <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-now-lets-you-combine-your-reels-recommendations-with-friends-160023003.html">began offering earlier this year</a>. Instagram is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-launches-reels-to-beat-tiktok-130009783.html">typically the one</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-190201529.html">copying TikTok</a>, so this is a nice change of pace.</p>

<p>TikTok has also announced something called Shared Collections. This is like the aforementioned Shared Feed, but for saved content. The tool lets users collect, organize and share groups of videos, with TikTok citing that people could use it to share reading lists, local restaurants to try and, of course, products to buy.</p>
<p>All you have to do is save a video, create a Shared Collection and send that list to someone else via direct message. Users must follow one another to access one of these lists. The tool is available globally right now to folks over the age of 16.</p>
<p>Finally, TikTok is rolling out themed holiday cards that can be sent in direct messages. They will be available globally later this month.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html?src=rss
