<p>JBL is trying its hand at something new, with a pair of AI-powered practice amps. The BandBox Solo and BandBox Trio include an onboard Stem AI that purportedly lets you separate or remove vocals and instruments from any music streamed over Bluetooth. So, say you&#39;re a young guitarist learning “Stairway to Heaven” (as one does). At least in theory, you could use the speaker to remove Jimmy Page&#39;s part and hone your chops with the rest of the band.</p><p>The $250 BandBox Solo, designed for individual musicians, has a single guitar / mic input. And the $600 BandBox Trio, better for bands, supports up to four instrument inputs. The latter also has a few extra perks not found in the Solo: onboard controls (to reduce reliance on the app) and an LCD.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jbl.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jbl.jpg" style="height:1079px;width:1915px;" alt="A hand adjusting knobs on the JBL BandBox Trio speaker" data-uuid="f3522b07-5c29-4542-8521-4dcd3a0b253d"><figcaption>The more expensive BandBox Trio has an LCD and more onboard controls.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>The JBL One app lets you add filters to match a variety of modern and vintage amp models. You&#39;ll also find effects like phaser, chorus, and reverb, as well as a pitch shifter and tuner. A built-in looper will allow for layering, but JBL says that feature will arrive via a software update in October.</p><p>JBL says the BandBox Solo supports up to six hours of battery life. The BandBox Trio is said to last up to 10 hours. But the latter has a replaceable battery, so you could buy a spare (for an as-yet-unknown price) and double that time.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f671e4c0-78f5-4be4-a1dc-bc74e91d5c55&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2a5cbfe-8d8c-4131-b0b7-d3db14c557cc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=JBL&amp;linkText=%24250+BandBox+Solo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYmwuY29tL0JBTkRCT1gtU09MTy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmE1Y2JmZS04ZDhjLTQxMzEtYjBiNy1kM2RiMTRjNTU3Y2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpibC5jb20vQkFOREJPWC1TT0xPLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfm1YIEn_qn3itz64ngtL8RHagmhk9uoGtW3-Ny8j-nG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jbl.com%2FBANDBOX-SOLO.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:JBL;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.jbl.com/BANDBOX-SOLO.html">$250 BandBox Solo</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f671e4c0-78f5-4be4-a1dc-bc74e91d5c55&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2a5cbfe-8d8c-4131-b0b7-d3db14c557cc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=JBL&amp;linkText=%24600+BandBox+Trio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYmwuY29tL0JBTkRCT1gtVFJJTy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmE1Y2JmZS04ZDhjLTQxMzEtYjBiNy1kM2RiMTRjNTU3Y2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpibC5jb20vQkFOREJPWC1UUklPLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfgztluLlU4JOEbPLhBkKYp0y-0fnc6onVPT_eGbZVUI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jbl.com%2FBANDBOX-TRIO.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:JBL;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.jbl.com/BANDBOX-TRIO.html">$600 BandBox Trio</a> are available to pre-order from JBL&#39;s website starting today.
