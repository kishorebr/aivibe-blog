<p>Behold Mark Zuckerberg: man of principle. Witness the Meta CEO's dedication to the most high-minded of causes: "currying favor with whoever's in charge." In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Zuckerberg co-founded <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://FWD.us" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a>, a pro-immigration advocacy group. For years, he vocally supported providing paths to citizenship for "the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born." Now, in 2025, with Donald Trump back in power and pushing draconian immigration policies, Zuckerberg's philanthropy organization has officially cut ties with the group. Who says Big Tech executives don't stand for anything?</p><p>On Friday, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-19/mark-zuckerberg-s-philanthropy-cut-ties-with-pro-immigration-organization-fwd-us" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a> on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) severing its ties with <a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a>. Zuckerberg's group provided no funding to the advocacy group for the first time this year. Up to that point, over half of the roughly $400 million donated to the nonprofit since 2013 had come from CZI.</p><p>In addition, CZI's chief of staff, Jordan Fox, resigned from the <a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a> board. No one else at CZI will fill the vacant slot, another first for the pro-immigration and justice reform advocacy group.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, a spokesperson for CZI said the change had been in the works for several years. “Nearly five years ago, we shared that we were focusing on our core work in science, education, and supporting our local communities,” the spokesperson said. “As part of that transition, we committed foundational funding to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://FWD.us" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a> to continue their bipartisan work. We have fulfilled that financial commitment and wound down our social advocacy funding.” She added that the couple’s Biohub initiative is currently their “primary philanthropy.” </p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/3b9fa1a0-e944-11ef-bbfd-1884989f2dc3" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/3b9fa1a0-e944-11ef-bbfd-1884989f2dc3" style="height:4731px;width:7097px;" alt="White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller (3rd R) speaks with CEO of Meta and Facebook Mark Zuckerberg (R) during a luncheon in honor of newly sworn in US President Donald Trump, in Statuary Hall at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.

It also changed its policies to allow for "insulting language" on topics of immigration and LGBTQ+ issues.

"When you meet these [immigrant] children who are really talented, and they've grown up in America, and they really don't know any other country besides that, but they don't have the opportunities that we all enjoy, it's really heartbreaking, right?" the tech executive said.

"This allows us to fight for immigrants under attack today and to build a better approach to immigration and criminal justice reform for many, many years to come."</p><p><strong>Update, December 19, 2025, 1:19PM PT</strong>: This story was updated to include a statement from a spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerbergs-nonprofit-cuts-ties-with-the-immigration-advocacy-group-he-co-founded-183447900.html?src=rss
