<p>After a symphony, online multiplayer and a remaster, the well-regarded (and often handheld) puzzler <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-tetris-effect-team-is-back-with-lumines-arise-211729116.html">Lumines</a> is getting Enhance’s full synesthetic, Tetris-flowing, treatment. <em>Lumines Arise</em> is almost here.</p>
<p>If you haven’t played the game before, Lumines’ premise centers on rotating and dropping four-square blocks made of one or two colors, building up larger squares of a single color. The game’s timeline sweeps across the playfield – to the beat of the soundtrack – erasing completed squares in its path, while also giving you the brief opportunity to quickly drop more squares, add multiplier combos and score even more points.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c20b7cb44da14a85b257f9b2b953e2ff"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwuqiVNs058?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> adds a new mechanic to the addictive yet simple puzzle. &#39;Burst&#39; is a refillable bar that you can trigger with L2/R2, which locks a square on the playing field, allowing you to pile on subsequent blocks. You can initiate Burst once the counter has rolled above 50, although it maxes out at 100. As you might expect for a synesthesia-tickling game like <em>Arise</em>, Burst mode has its own low-key musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>Lumines has never looked better. But that’s not just due to 2025 hardware power, but also design choices for Lumines’ skins – the unhinged wallpaper design and block themes that bubble up as you advance through puzzle stages. They’re delightfully mad and, at times, distracting. (As you play, the view of your Lumines blocks will occasionally ‘zoom’ closer – this is intentional. Game Director Takashi Ishihara said this was to both add some dynamism to what are typically static blocks, but also to pull the players’ attention back to the game at hand. <em>Lumines Arise</em> wants you to focus on the now, not the score, your Burst meter, or your customizable avatar.)</p>
<p>My favorite part of the demo was the final stage, which featured two chameleons simply raving along to the dance music. The soundtrack is, naturally, a banger, too. <em>Lumines Arise </em>features new music from Hydelic, also responsible for the award-winning soundtrack of <em>Tetris Effect: Connected</em>. (The band has already launched one track, &quot;Only Human,&quot; on Bandcamp – it’s coming to other streaming services, too.)</p>
<p>On another stage, two skeletal hands, seemingly strung up like puppets, twitch and wriggle as you shift and rotate your blocks. If anything, I think Enhance missed a trick not mapping the finger movements to a DualSense controller. I said that in front of Ishihara because I have zero sense of decorum — apparently, he&#39;d had the same idea. I now consider myself a game designer.</p>
<p>I got to briefly see <em>Lumines Arise</em> running on a Steam Deck, too. The time of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-hands-on-i-think-nintendos-new-console-is-worth-the-450-130819785.html">handheld console </a>and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-coming-this-holiday-171550555.html">PC is now</a>, so it&#39;s nice to see a typically made-for-consoles game ready for this new gaming PC form factor.</p>
<p>Ishihara teased that there’s more to reveal ahead of <em>Arise</em>’s launch. The game will launch on both PS5 and Steam, and it will also feature VR compatibility on both platforms. While Enhance wasn’t yet willing to reveal the details, there will also be some form of multiplayer, but it seems like it’ll be in a different form compared to the more adversarial nature of Tetris Effect’s multiplayer modes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Ishihara wanted to highlight that the avatars, which dance and emote in sync with your in-game actions, now feature legs. That is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-avatars-metaverse-legs-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-190937062.html">important</a>, apparently. Enhance is promising more answers in due time. <em>Lumines Arise</em> is set to launch in fall 2025.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lumines-arise-hands-on-interview-takashi-ishihara-000038767.html?src=rss
