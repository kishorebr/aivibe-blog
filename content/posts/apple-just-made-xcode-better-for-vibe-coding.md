The new release expands on the AI features the company introduced with Xcode 26 at WWDC 2025 to give systems like Claude and ChatGPT more robust access to its in-house IDE.&nbsp;</p><p>With the update, Apple says Claude and OpenAI&#39;s Codex &quot;can search documentation, explore file structures, update project settings, and verify their work visually by capturing Xcode Previews and iterating through builds and fixes.&quot; This is in contrast to earlier releases of Xcode 26 where those same agents were limited in what they could see of a developer&#39;s Xcode environment, restricting their utility. According to Apple, the change will give users tools they can use to streamline their processes and work more efficiently than before. </p><p>Developers can add Claude and Codex to their Xcode terminal from the Intelligence section of the app&#39;s setting menu. Once a provider is selected, the interface allows users to also pick their preferred model. So if you like the outputs of say GPT 5.1 over GPT 5.2, you can use the older system.&nbsp;</p><p>The tighter integration with Claude and Codex was made possible by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers Apple has deployed. MCP is a technology Anthropic debuted in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">fall 2024</a> to make it easier for large language models like Claude to share data with third-party tools and systems. Since its introduction, MCP has become an industry standard — with OpenAI, for instance, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-support-for-remote-mcp-servers-image-generation-code-interpreter-and-more-in-the-responses-api/1266973" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">adopting the protocol</a> last year to facilitate its own set of connections.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says it worked directly with Anthropic and OpenAI to optimize token usage through Xcode, but the company’s adoption of MCP means developers will be able to add any coding agent that supports the protocol to their terminal in the future. Xcode 26.3 is available to download for all members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, with the Mac Store availability “coming soon.”   </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-just-made-xcode-better-for-vibe-coding-195653049.html?src=rss
