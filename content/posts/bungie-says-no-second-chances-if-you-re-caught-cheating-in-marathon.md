<p>Bungie isn&#39;t taking any prisoners when it comes to cheating on its upcoming extraction shooter, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html">Marathon</a>. In a detailed <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">blog post</a> explaining its anti-cheat measures, Bungie took a very declarative position against those caught trying to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>&quot;We are taking a strong stance against cheating and anyone found to be cheating or developing cheats will be permanently banned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances,&quot; the blog post read, adding that there will be an appeals system in place.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, Bungie&#39;s anti-cheat standards go beyond punishment. In the blog post, Bungie detailed that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-shares-first-looks-at-gameplay-from-its-new-shooter-marathon-alongside-a-release-date-213530509.html">Marathon</a>&#39;s dedicated servers have full authority on movement, shooting, actions, and inventory. Since these key actions rely on the server, it will translate to smoother gunplay for players as well as the prevention of cheats related to teleportation, unlimited ammo or damage manipulation. Bungie is also incorporating a &quot;Fog of War&quot; system that limits an individual player&#39;s client to see only certain regions of a map, which should prevent wall hacks, ESP cheats or loot revealers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of these robust regulations, Bungie is utilizing BattlEye, a kernel-level anticheat that&#39;s seen with other popular multiplayer shooters like <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-destiny-2-player-lawsuit-cheating-harassment-200942428.html"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>. Bungie added that in the event of disconnecting, you&#39;ll be able to reconnect to your run without any hitches. If players can&#39;t reconnect due to an issue with the servers, Bungie said it will &quot;attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players.&quot;</p>
<p>Marathon isn&#39;t out until March 5, but Bungie is doing a preview weekend with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-server-slam">Server Slam</a> event starting February 26. Still, it&#39;s obvious that Bungie already wants to get ahead of the competition, since Arc Raiders, another recently released extraction shooter, has been dealing with its own cheating problem. To address the rise in cheating, the game&#39;s developer, Embark Studios, implemented a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/27/arc-raiders-new-3-strike-cheater-permaban-is-annoying-players/">three-strike system</a>, which some players have criticized as too lenient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-says-no-second-chances-if-youre-caught-cheating-in-marathon-191633998.html?src=rss
