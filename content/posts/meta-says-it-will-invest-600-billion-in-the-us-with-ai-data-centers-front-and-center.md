<p>Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/meta-data-centers-drive-economic-growth-across-us/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">said</a> on Friday that it&#39;s investing $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs by 2028. Although the announcement is light on specifics (and heavy on standard Big Tech self-congratulation), it sounds like much of it will go toward <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">AI data centers</a>.</p><p>&quot;At Meta, we&#39;re focused on creating the next generation of AI products and building personal superintelligence for everyone,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Data centers are crucial to reaching these goals and helping America maintain its technological edge.&quot;</p><p>If you feel like this isn&#39;t the first you&#39;ve heard of Meta and $600 billion in US spending, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s the figure Mark Zuckerberg gave during a September White House dinner with Big Tech CEOs. But more memorable was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/zuckerberg-caught-on-hot-mic-telling-trump-i-wasnt-sure-how-much-to-promise-to-spend-on-ai-in-the-us-211915608.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the hot-mic moment later captured</a> between Zuckerberg and President Trump. &quot;Sorry, I wasn&#39;t ready,&quot; the Meta CEO said to the president, referring to his $600 billion pledge. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure what number you wanted to go with.&quot;</p><p>Meta&#39;s announcement today includes figures intended to bolster its claim to be a champion of US infrastructure. The company says that, since 2010, its data centers have &quot;supported over 30,000 skilled trade jobs and 5,000 operational jobs.&quot; Meta adds that it&#39;s currently bringing over $20 billion to US subcontractors.</p><p>As for the &quot;superintelligence&quot; mention, it also surfaced when Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-announces-huge-new-data-centers-but-they-could-gobble-up-millions-of-gallons-of-water-per-day-174000478.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">announced data center investments</a> in July. That term typically refers to a hypothetical point at which AI surpasses human cognitive abilities.

The company views its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI glasses</a> as a central part of that future. Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/07/31/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-ai/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">said</a> in July that anyone without them may eventually suffer from a &quot;pretty significant cognitive disadvantage.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-will-invest-600-billion-in-the-us-with-ai-data-centers-front-and-center-195000377.html?src=rss
