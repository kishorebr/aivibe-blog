<p>Meta&#39;s lineup of smart glasses could soon get a lot more capabilities. The company will begin allowing outside developers to bring their apps to its RayBan and Oakley smart glasses, Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://developers.meta.com/blog/introducing-meta-wearables-device-access-toolkit/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=connect-2025-day-2-keynote-recap-vr-development-use-cases-wearable-device-access-toolkit"><ins>announced</ins></a> on the second day of its Connect event.</p>
<p>Up to now, Meta has only had a limited number of third-party integrations for its glasses, with apps like Spotify and Audible. But Meta will now allow developers to start experimenting with apps that can take advantage of the built-in sensors and audio capabilities of its glasses. This means other companies will be able to create their own custom experiences that use Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-new-ai-powers-are-impressive-and-worrying-181036772.html"><ins>multimodal AI</ins></a> features.</p>

A demo video shows a visitor walking around Disneyland and asking the AI assistant about the rides she&#39;s seeing and other park information. 18Birdies, a golf app, is working on an integration that can give players club recommendations and yardage stats.</p>
<p>Notably, these apps all seem like they work with Meta&#39;s non-display glasses, which means that even people who have first-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses could see a bunch of added new functionality. It&#39;s not clear if the company will also allow developers to also build experiences that can take advantage of the display on its newest <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-offer-an-ar-display-for-799-002921925.html"><ins>Meta Ray-Ban Display</ins></a> frames, but that could open up even more possibilities.</p>
<p>Meta&#39;s new set of tools, officially called the &quot;Wearables Device Access Toolkit,&quot; will roll out as a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://developers.meta.com/wearables/notify/">limited developer preview </a>ahead of broader availability in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html?src=rss
