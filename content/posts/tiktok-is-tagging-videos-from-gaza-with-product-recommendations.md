<p>TikTok has been tagging videos from war-ravaged Gaza with product recommendations, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782540/tiktok-shop-scanning-gaza-videos-e-commerce-dupes"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. The publication detailed a scenario in which footage of a Palestinian woman walking amidst rubble presented TikTok shop recommendations that matched what she wore in the video.</p>
<p>The algorithm suggested products with names like &quot;Dubai Middle East Turkish Elegant Lace-Up Dress&quot; and &quot;Womenâ€™s Solid Color Knot Front Long Sleeve Dress.&quot; The original footage showed the woman searching for lost family members.</p>

<p>This is thanks to a new addition to the TikTok app that uses AI to identify objects in posts. When a user pauses a video, the shop will automatically recommend products that resemble those objects. Today&#39;s reporting indicates that the company didn&#39;t give much forethought as to which types of videos this technology should be applied to.</p>
<p>The new tool isn&#39;t available to everyone just yet, as it&#39;s rolling out on a limited basis. To check if your app has been updated, simply pause a video and look for the &quot;Find Similar&quot; pop-up. We reached out to TikTok to ask about how this technology is being used and will update this post when we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-is-tagging-videos-from-gaza-with-product-recommendations-184206127.html?src=rss
