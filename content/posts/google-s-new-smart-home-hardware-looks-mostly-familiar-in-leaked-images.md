The new speaker will come in what looks like red, light green, black and beige color options, and offer &quot;360-degree sound.&quot; <em>Android Headlines</em> writes that the speaker also supports Gemini Live, Sound Sensing for detecting smoke alarms or glass breaking and pairing with a </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/google-tv-streamer-review-a-great-side-piece-for-your-tv-with-a-dash-of-smart-home-chops-and-inessential-ai-160034550.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Google TV Streamer</span></a><span style="color:rgb(32, 43, 51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google&#39;s not done releasing new products this year. <br><br>ðŸ”Š Google Home Speaker<br>ðŸ“¸ Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen)<br>ðŸ“¸ Nest Cam Outdoor (3rd Gen)<br>ðŸšª Nest Doorbell wired<br><br>More info: <a href="https://t.co/DUuZSduVhJ">https://t.co/DUuZSduVhJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/dpVTrQoERA">pic.twitter.com/dpVTrQoERA</a></p>â€” Androidheadline (@Androidheadline) <a href="https://twitter.com/Androidheadline/status/1959978270084284759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(32, 43, 51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The rest of the smart home lineup will feel familiar, save for some new colors, internal tweaks and software features. The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They&#39;ll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in &quot;Snow&quot; (white), &quot;Berry&quot; (red) and &quot;Hazel&quot; (gray). The camera will include a new &quot;Zoom and Crop&quot; feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it&#39;ll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(32, 43, 51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it&#39;ll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it&#39;ll be available in Snow, Hazel and &quot;Linen&quot; (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Pixel 10 lineup</span></a><span style="color:rgb(32, 43, 51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(32, 43, 51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>Android Headlines</em> writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google&#39;s entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we&#39;ll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-new-smart-home-hardware-looks-mostly-familiar-in-leaked-images-190011191.html?src=rss
