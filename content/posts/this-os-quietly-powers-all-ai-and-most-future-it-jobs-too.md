    This OS quietly powers all AI - and most future IT jobs, too
     
    Without Linux, there is no ChatGPT. No AI at all. None. Here's why.

                                          Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways AI runs on Linux. Period. There are no substitutes.Canonical and Red Hat are building Nvidia Vera Rubin-specific Linux distros.The Linux kernel is being tuned for AI and ML workloads.Modern AI began with open source, and it ran on Linux. Today, Linux isn't just important for artificial intelligence; it's the foundation upon which today's entire modern AI stack runs. From hyperscale training clusters down to edge inference boxes, it's all Linux from top to bottom.Also: I tried a Linux distro that promises free, built-in AI - and things got weirdAI's magic tricks are really the aggregate output of very prosaic infrastructure: supercomputers, GPU farms, and cloud clusters that almost all run some flavor of Linux. The core machine-learning frameworks -- TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and friends -- were all developed and tuned first on Linux. Tooling around these tools, from Jupyter and Anaconda to Docker and Kubernetes, is similarly optimized for Linux. Why IT jobs will live and die on LinuxWhy? Because it's on Linux where researchers and production engineers actually deploy AI. Future IT jobs will live and die on Linux. You see, AI runs on Linux because it's the most flexible, powerful, and scalable environment for the GPU‑heavy, distributed workloads modern AI requires. In addition, the entire tooling and cloud ecosystem has standardized on Linux. Yes, every AI platform, whether it's OpenA
