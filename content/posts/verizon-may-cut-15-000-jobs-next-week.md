Sources told the publication that Verizon is attempting to reduce costs as it faces more competition for wireless service and home internet customers. At the reported scope, this would be the largest reduction in history for the telecom company.&nbsp;</p><p>Verizon leadership indicated that a sea change was coming in its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2225d53b-bfe1-4d56-bd6e-3885c642b140&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=295e1a57-c93e-43e6-91b4-cb634c856f7e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Verizon&amp;linkText=third-quarter+financial+report&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXJpem9uLmNvbS9hYm91dC9uZXdzL3Zlcml6b24tcmVwb3J0cy0zcS0yMDI1LWVhcm5pbmdzLXJlaXRlcmF0ZXMtZnVsbC15ZWFyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1ndWlkYW5jZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjk1ZTFhNTctYzkzZS00M2U2LTkxYjQtY2I2MzRjODU2ZjdlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXJpem9uLmNvbS9hYm91dC9uZXdzL3Zlcml6b24tcmVwb3J0cy0zcS0yMDI1LWVhcm5pbmdzLXJlaXRlcmF0ZXMtZnVsbC15ZWFyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1ndWlkYW5jZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAafknC1TvtlWcrCd47ceTBQf42u68kDzuZzFDbGg8Pwc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fverizon-reports-3q-2025-earnings-reiterates-full-year-financial-guidance" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Verizon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-3q-2025-earnings-reiterates-full-year-financial-guidance">third-quarter financial report</a> last month, although many of the figures for the period were positive. The company&#39;s net income reached $5.1 billion and most other metrics showed year-on-year growth.
