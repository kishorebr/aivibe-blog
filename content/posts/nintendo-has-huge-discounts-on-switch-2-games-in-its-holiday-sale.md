<p>Nintendo is in a giving state of mind this season, offering some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/hits-for-the-holidays/#sort=df&amp;p=2" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">holiday deals</a> on games in the eShop, including a few recent Switch 2 titles. For instance, the Switch 2 version of <em>Ball x Pit</em>, which was one of our staff&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">favorite games of 2025</a>, is 20 percent off at $12. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is $40, down from the usual $50 on Switch 2, which is about as good a deal as you’ll get for a current-year game release.</p><p>There are also a few older games that have gotten even steeper discounts. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a whopping 75 percent off, so load it onto your new console for $15.<em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 is down to $40. At about $33, <em>Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Edition</em> is half off for the original Switch. <em>No Man&#39;s Sky</em> is also 50 percent off, so you can grab it for either Switch console for just $24. <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> is down to $40, which is $20 off, and <em>Nier: Automata</em> is $16, compared with its usual $40 price tag.</p><p>Those are just a few that caught our eye. The discounts will run until January 4, so you can make purchases as a last-minute gift or load up your own Switch in case nobody gifts you with a game you&#39;ve been eyeing.</p><p><strong>Update, December 23, 6:50PM ET: </strong>CD Projekt RED has adjusted the price of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> up from $17.49 to $39.99 and <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>down from $34.49 to $14.49. The company said the discounts were “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/2003602413702512780" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a result of an error we made when submitting</a>,” the error clearly being that they attached the “75 percent off” and “42 percent off” to the wrong games. Congratulations if you were able to buy <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>for $17.49. Commiserations if you just paid $34.49 for <em>The Witcher 3</em>. We updated the article after publish to reflect the above changes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-has-huge-discounts-on-switch-2-games-in-its-holiday-sale-220058951.html?src=rss
