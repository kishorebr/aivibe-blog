<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted about the potential of AI and the company’s approach to developing it in a rare all-hands today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/apple-ceo-tells-staff-ai-is-ours-to-grab-in-hourlong-pep-talk">that was reported on by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Apple has been slow to roll out some of its AI features and has stumbled with a planned AI-powered upgrade to Siri, which it delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought">earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">The executive gathered staff at Apple’s on-campus auditorium Friday in Cupertino, California, telling them that the AI revolution is “as big or bigger” as the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and apps. “Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,” Cook told employees, according to people aware of the meeting. “We will make the investment to do it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cook also apparently pointed to how the company has “rarely been first” in categories like personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and MP3 players but that Apple eventually made the “modern” versions of those. “This is how I feel about AI,” Cook said, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Software chief Craig Federighi also spoke, discussing the Siri delay and how the company originally wanted to build it with a “hybrid architecture.” Under that plan, one system would take care of things Siri can now, and the other would be powered by LLMs, but “we realized that approach wasn’t going to get us to Apple quality,” he said. The new plan is to move everything to a new architecture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The all-hands follows Cook’s comments ahead of an earnings call yesterday where he said that the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716790/apple-earnings-q3-2025-ai-tim-cook">“open to” acquisitions</a> to accelerate its roadmap. Apple has also lost some of its AI talent as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/700196/meta-apple-openai-ai-talent-war">Meta’s “superintelligence” hiring spree</a>.</p>
