<p>Last year in Las Vegas at CES 2025, Sony Honda Mobility displayed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">yet another revision</a> of its now-familiar yet still-unreleased Afeela 1 sedan. With a starting price of $89,900 and a maximum range of 300 miles, it didn&#39;t seem like a great value proposition. 12 months later, the math still hasn&#39;t changed, but would-be buyers now have a slightly taller option to consider.</p><p>Meet the Afeela Prototype 2026, a version of the Afeela 1 sedan that&#39;s been up-scaled to better suit American SUV proclivities. It offers a carbon copy of the smaller Afeela&#39;s understated styling, including the external, nose-mounted LCD, and is due &quot;as early as 2028.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_010.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_010.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Afeela Prototype 2026" data-uuid="37add2f9-f937-4d3b-8ea0-b5e31beedd33"/><figcaption>Afeela Prototype 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>That&#39;s code for &quot;2029 is probably more likely&quot; and is, sadly, all we know about the thing for now.&nbsp;</p><p>And what about the Afeela 1? Shugo Yamaguchi, president and CEO of Sony Honda Mobility of America, confirmed that it&#39;s still on track for a release this year, still priced at $90,000 to start, and still set to be built at Honda&#39;s Ohio factory. That last bit is particularly good news, as the global tariff situation has been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/trump-to-impose-25-percent-tariffs-on-all-cars-not-made-in-the-us-120026997.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">rather</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/trump-temporarily-eases-car-tariffs-following-automaker-complaints-130011086.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">fluid</a> since we saw the sedan last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the Afeela 1&#39;s core attributes haven&#39;t aged so well, particularly given it&#39;s intended to appeal to an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">increasingly skeptical American market</a>, a situation that has driven Honda to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">dial down</a> its own US EV aspirations. 300 miles of range is an increasingly middling figure, especially for a machine priced within spitting distance of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-new-taycan-evs-have-more-range-faster-acceleration-and-a-higher-price-123514002.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Porsche Taycan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the Afeela 1 compelling, Sony Honda Mobility is leaning into the tech play, launching with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system (a la <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gms-super-cruise-expansion-adds-750000-miles-of-rural-roads-100119273.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">GM&#39;s Super Cruise</a>). Thanks to the beauty of over-the-air updates, the Afeela 1 will eventually offer Level 4 autonomy, leaning on a bevy of integrated sensors, including a roof-mounted LIDAR pod. That would theoretically mean you could drive in <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> while your car drove you to work.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_004.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_004.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Afeela 1" data-uuid="4cc8694b-bfeb-4c2e-9252-49cf2f856383"/><figcaption>Afeela 1</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>At launch, though, the driver will only be able to play GT and other PlayStation games while the car is parked, thanks to built-in Remote Play functionality. Beyond gaming, Sony is building out a comprehensive set of APIs that will enable third-party developers to create immersive in-cabin experiences, including custom gauge clusters and infotainment skins. All that will be run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon Digital Chassis, with enough power to handle both the evolving active safety and infotainment duties.</p><p>That all sounds fun, but the bad news is that would-be buyers are going to have to wait a little longer to start customising their rides. Production on the Afeela 1 has slipped, and it will not ship to the first customers until the very end of 2026. Those customers will have to be in California, as that&#39;s the only state where the sedan will be for sale. Arizona will come next, sometime in 2027, but nobody at Sony Honda Mobility will say which state will get the next bite of this apple, or when.&nbsp;</p><p>Will it be worth the wait? We&#39;ll circle back later with more detailed impressions from inside this year&#39;s iteration of the Afeela 1.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html?src=rss
