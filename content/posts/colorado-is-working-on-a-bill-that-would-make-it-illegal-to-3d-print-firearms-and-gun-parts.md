<p>A collective of Colorado lawmakers wants to put an end to &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-3d-printed-ghost-guns-rule-200806385.html">ghost guns</a>&quot; and their rising popularity. Earlier this week, the state&#39;s House Judiciary Committee voted in a 7-4 majority to pass the bill, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1144">HB26-1144</a>, along for a decision with the full House of Representatives. The proposed law would &quot;prohibit the use of a three-dimensional printer, or similar technology, to make a firearm or a firearm component.&quot;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/manhattans-da-wants-to-know-why-youtube-is-pushing-ghost-gun-tutorials-to-kids-070219455.html">Ghost guns</a> are typically made from 3D printers or similar machines without serial numbers, making them virtually impossible to trace and allowing users to skirt the federal requirements for purchasing a firearm. While the bill targets using a 3D printer to make guns, large-capacity magazines and other related components, it even bans possessing and distributing the instructions to manufacture guns in this way. However, these rules would be exempt for federally licensed firearm manufacturers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;These ghost guns are increasingly found at crime scenes, making it harder for law enforcement to track down a suspect because the gun isn’t traceable,&quot; the bill&#39;s sponsor, Lindsay Gilchrist, said in a press release.</p>
<p>Prior to this proposal, Colorado <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-bans-possession-creation-of-ghost-guns/">passed a law</a> in 2023 that banned owning ghost guns or making frames for them. While SB23-279 laid the groundwork, HB26-1144 can be seen as the next step since it&#39;s much more encompassing by targeting ghost guns even before they&#39;re made. According to the bill, first-time violations will be treated as a misdemeanor, while repeat offenses will be upgraded to a felony charge. Looking ahead, HB26-1144 still has to secure a vote from both the Colorado Senate and House of Representatives before being delivered to the governor to be signed into law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/colorado-is-working-on-a-bill-that-would-make-it-illegal-to-3d-print-firearms-and-gun-parts-211508169.html?src=rss
