<p>It&#39;s been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-lg-w-series-oled-4k.html">Wallpaper TV</a> that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the &quot;world&#39;s thinnest&quot; OLED that&#39;s truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.</p>
<p>Instead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It&#39;s similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-is-not-selling-the-frame-pro-for-cheap-185607096.html">Frame TV lineup</a>. While you won&#39;t have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor&#39;s hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That&#39;s more than three times the thickness, but it&#39;s still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.</p>

<p>The latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG&#39;s third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There&#39;s even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG  specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.</p>
<p>The updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that&#39;s crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync, AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you&#39;re not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html">Gallery+</a> feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.</p>

<p>LG didn&#39;t reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn&#39;t offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-28-lgs-77-inch-wallpaper-tv-is-selling-for-the-low-low-price-of-2.html">Wallpaper TV</a>, which cost up to $20,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html?src=rss
