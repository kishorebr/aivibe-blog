<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. It’s been a very busy week of fun game releases (next week will be too!), so let’s get into some of them after a quick reflection on gaming while traveling.</p><p>I love my Steam Deck. I really truly do. It’s a fantastic machine. And yet when I brought it with me on a five-week trip over the holidays, I used it for barely an hour the entire time. That doesn’t really justify the space and weight it takes up in my bag. The same holds true for my Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation Portal.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be leaving them all at home next time. I’ll take a small controller (probably <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">OhSnap&#39;s MCON</a>) so I can play the odd game on my laptop or phone. I’ll bring my Playdate as well. I adore that little yellow console, and I haven’t spent nearly enough time using it. I have a lot of neat-looking indie games to catch up on there (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.date/games/diora/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Diora</em></a> looks particularly interesting). I’m more likely to play something on a flight if it’s on a device I can pull out from my pocket. I just wish Panic had put a backlight in the Playdate.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><p></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital gave <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-is-finally-getting-a-co-op-mode-but-its-local-only-180715026.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a><em> </em>fans a whole bunch of reasons to jump back into the game this week with the arrival of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cult-of-the-lambs-next-dlc-is-woolhaven-out-in-early-2026-225129643.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Woolhaven </em>expansion</a>. You&#39;ll need to get close to the end of the base game (though you don&#39;t need to beat the final boss) before you can experience what the DLC has to offer. It includes weather effects, a new mountain area with a pair of fresh dungeons, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/this-is-how-the-new-ranching-system-will-work-in-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-194324041.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a ranching system</a> (which allows you to raise animals as pets or for food) and much more.</p><p>Folks who dig <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>seem to get really into the game. After a few years of free updates from Massive Monster, <em>Woolhaven </em>is a major expansion that&#39;s similar in scope to the base game, so it should keep fans busy for quite a while if they want to try everything. The DLC is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840050/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Woolhaven/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">PC</a>, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It costs $17 if you already have the base game.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEIyvjVQCAE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Inkle, the studio behind <em>Overboard!</em> and the wonderful <em>A Highland Song</em> is back with <em>TR-49</em>, a puzzle game with a World War II computer at its core. Over five decades, an array of books, letters and journals were fed into the machine as part of an effort to &quot;crack the code of reality.&quot; But now you&#39;re tasked with finding and destroying one specific book before a timer runs out.</p><p>It all seems rather mysterious. To give you a sense of what&#39;s going on here, Inkle says it drew inspiration from narrative deduction games like <em>The Roottrees are Dead, The Return of the Obra Dinn </em>and <em>Her Story</em>, as well as audio dramas. I can&#39;t see myself having the time or patience to figure out the enigma of this particular machine (I imagine many players will need a notebook for this one), but I&#39;m intrigued enough to at least watch a Let&#39;s Play at some point. You can experience this mystery for yourself on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3838370/TR49/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Steam</a> (normally $7, but there&#39;s a 10 percent launch discount until January 28).</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cafPCloPgtc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Another week, another Metroidvania, but <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit </em>has a more striking art style than most. This game from Douze Dixièmes and publisher Focus Entertainment debuted to positive reviews this week. After the AI caretakers on a forgotten spaceship stop working, you&#39;ll have to help the robot MIO explore the spacecraft &quot;to revive its lost memories&quot; and save it from doom. Naturally, you&#39;ll discover some new abilities along the way, including a grappling hook and air gliding.</p><p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> is available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010037" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86d78fd7-706f-45bc-8ccc-e3d69ab5f680&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9taW8tbWVtb3JpZXMtaW4tb3JiaXQvOW5wODZrNTdzcW0zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmQ3OGZkNy03MDZmLTQ1YmMtOGNjYy1lM2Q2OWFiNWY2ODAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL21pby1tZW1vcmllcy1pbi1vcmJpdC85bnA4Nms1N3NxbTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfWbXK45jmpjFawfpYsSR87Sl8iitEZNT22MkcoQFtF5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fmio-memories-in-orbit%2F9np86k57sqm3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mio-memories-in-orbit/9np86k57sqm3">Xbox Series X/S</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch-2" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Switch 2</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Steam</a>, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mio-memories-in-orbit-e46c84" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Epic Games Store</a> and the Microsoft Store for $20 (with a 10 percent launch discount on some platforms). You can also check it out via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESUKobGZcH8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em> is a pixel-art point-and-click narrative adventure and a sequel to Three Bees&#39; <em>Perfect Tides</em>. Over the course of an in-game year, you&#39;ll help 18-year-old Mara explore the big city and find her place in the world. </p><p>The early 2000s vibes of the trailer are immaculate, so I&#39;m going to have to try to play this at some point. <em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088810/Perfect_Tides_Station_to_Station/" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">Steam</a> for PC and Mac for $20.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKO6MGVoXMI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Cozy cafe sim <em>Tailside </em>debuted in early access on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Steam</a> (normally $11, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until January 28) this week. I&#39;m bummed I haven&#39;t had a chance to try this one from Coffee Beans Dev yet, because it looks lovely.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with serving snacks and drinks to your furry customers, you can learn more about the visitors to your cafe by reading stories about them in the newspaper (hopefully nice ones!). You can play at your own pace as you draw latte art and decorate your cafe. Eventually, you&#39;ll be able to visit other players&#39; cafes and open a flower shop. Like I said, it looks lovely.</p><h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BALL x PIT’s first FREE major update, The Regal Update, launches on January 26th on all platforms! <br><br>Adding:<br>🤠2 new characters - The Carouser &amp; The Falconer<br>🏐8 new balls<br>🎯New passives<br>✨Plus a nice surprise you’re going to love! <a href="https://t.co/t0tYlwjOXk">pic.twitter.com/t0tYlwjOXk</a></p>— BALL x PIT 🏐 OUT NOW (@BALLxPIT) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALLxPIT/status/2013296280261234716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote>


</div><p>One of my favorite games of last year is getting <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pit-is-evolving-with-a-string-of-free-updates-in-2026-181947946.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">a free update</a> on January 26. Just when I thought I was out of <em>Ball x Pit</em>, Kenny Sun and friends (along with publisher Devolver) are pulling me right back in to check out two new characters, eight fresh balls with their own abilities, more passives and some kind of surprise.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">I adore <em>Ball x Pit</em></a><em> </em>and this update is going to be a drop everything and play immediately deal for me. The Regal Update will be available on all platforms: Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. <em>Ball x Pit </em>costs $15. It&#39;s available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass too.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ael4oMaKQM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;m interested to check out the demo for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/a-vampire-survivors-roguelike-deckbuilder-spinoff-is-coming-in-2026-183841289.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a>, a <em>Vampire Survivors </em>spin-off.

Your progress will carry over into the full game, which will be on Game Pass on day one.</p><p>As a rule, turn-based games aren&#39;t really my jam, and nor are roguelike deckbuilders. But I&#39;m a big fan of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, so I&#39;m definitely willing to give this a shot. It helps that <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>seems to be fast-paced and that it draws from the chaotic visuals of the original game. <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>is coming to Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android later this year.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laq3IrWbsVE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Speaking of interesting demos, one for <em>Ratcheteer DX </em>is available now on PC ahead of the full game&#39;s release on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/ratcheteer-dx-switch" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">Switch</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3166150/Ratcheteer_DX/" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">Steam</a> (PC and Mac) and the Mac App Store on March 5. It&#39;ll normally cost $13, but a limited-time discount will reduce the price to $9.75. If the game&#39;s name sounds familiar, that&#39;s because this is a color version of the Playdate season one title <em>Ratcheteer</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>This take on the pixel-art action-adventure has multiple visual filters, a &quot;CD-quality stereo soundtrack&quot; and support for more languages. Playdate creator Panic is publishing <em>Ratcheteer DX</em>, whose developers are Shaun Inman, Matthew Grimm and Charlie Davis.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6SYjoGrpwY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s wrap things up for this week with a cinematic trailer and release date for <em>Aethus</em>, a story-driven survival-crafting and base-building game from a solo developer at Pawsmonaut Games. It&#39;s coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">Steam</a> on March 6.</p><p><em>Aethus </em>is a game about &quot;carving out a future from the ruins of corporate greed&quot; in a dystopian sci-fi world. As ex-mining engineer Maeve, you start with basic gear and a drone companion by your side. You&#39;ll explore what&#39;s left of a failed science expedition and abandoned facilities as you try to establish your own mining claim after leaving a company that drains planets of their resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you&#39;ll upgrade your gear and build out your base as you progress. You can modify settings like the base&#39;s air supply, how quickly your hunger and thirst needs change and how much you can carry to fine tune the experience.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/more-cult-of-the-lamb-a-world-war-ii-computer-mystery-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000807.html?src=rss
