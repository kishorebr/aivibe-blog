<p>Analogue is back with another hit of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-will-at-long-last-ship-on-november-18-151854397.html">N64 nostalgia</a>, but with colorways that are deep cuts for even the biggest Nintendo nerds. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/analogue/status/2019803274946228560?s=20">Analogue</a> announced its latest run of limited edition versions of its 3D console, this time drawing inspiration from a batch of prototype colorways for the original N64 that were manufactured but never hit the market. Now, the Analogue 3D will come in Ghost, Glacier, Extreme Green, Ocean and yes, even <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/analogues-limited-edition-transparent-pocket-handhelds-come-in-seven-colors-150049816.html">Atomic Purple</a>.</p>
<p>It may just be a cosmetic upgrade, but it&#39;s worth noting that each of the colorways has matching cables, power adapters and 16GB SD cards that come preinstalled. Analogue even partnered with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/analogue/status/2019803278088020241?s=20">8BitDo</a> again to create color-matched controllers that complete the colorful retro experience.</p>

<p>As usual, Analogue said this latest run will be available in &quot;highly limited quantities,&quot; starting on February 9 at 11AM ET. Be sure to set a reminder because the first <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-analogue-3d-will-be-restocked-on-november-24-but-itll-cost-20-more-173615217.html">Analogue 3D</a> drop sold out quickly and the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-is-weaponizing-your-nostalgia-with-these-translucent-versions-of-its-3d-console-181105740.html">Funtastic colorways</a> went out of stock just as fast. According to Analogue, the consoles will go for $299.99 and start shipping 24 to 48 hours after orders are completed. 8BitDo said the $49.99 controllers will be available for preorder at the same time as the 3D console, but see its first shipments starting in April.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogue-unearths-n64-prototype-colors-for-its-limited-edition-3d-console-171923894.html?src=rss
