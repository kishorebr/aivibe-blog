So simple you might not understand who you&#39;re sharing it without digging into your settings. That&#39;s naturally led to<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/adam-mosseri-says-people-are-confused-about-how-the-instagram-map-works-184736070.html"> confusion from some Instagram users</a> as to how the feature works.</p>
<p>If you already spend a lot of time on Instagram and are looking for a way to see where your friends have been, it&#39;s worth familiarizing yourself with how Instagram Map works. And if you&#39;re worried about what information Instagram is broadcasting without your knowledge, you might as well get comfortable with the feature&#39;s settings. Here&#39;s how to do both in the Instagram app.</p>

<p>To access Instagram Map, you&#39;ll have to head to the DMs section of Instagram, and then tap on the Map icon in the top row of status icons. The first time you tap on the map, Instagram will walk you through how Instagram Map shares your location, and why Location Services needs to be enabled for it will work. Then, if you&#39;re not already sharing your location with Instagram, you&#39;ll receive a pop-up from your phone asking if you want to share your location. Tapping through that will take you to the map itself.</p>
<p>The majority of the Instagram Map is taken up by a map displaying your current location, with a search bar at the bottom for looking up the location of your friends. Scroll around for a bit and your might see a profile picture marking a friend&#39;s current location, or miniature posts tagged with a specific location. There&#39;s a few basic things you can do with Instagram Map:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Swipe around and see friends&#39; posts displayed geographically</p></li>
<li><p>Use the search bar to find a friend&#39;s current location or recent tagged posts</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on a friend to be taken to their profile, or a post to see it in full</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instagram Map is primarily informational. It can tell your where your friends are or where they&#39;ve recently been, and let you view content based on where it was posted. It&#39;s really not much more complicated then that. Unless you&#39;re picky about who can see your location.</p>

<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/405c22c0-7a14-11f0-b4e7-6227cb7c32e1" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/405c22c0-7a14-11f0-b4e7-6227cb7c32e1" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A screenshot of the various location settings available in Instagram Map." data-uuid="ced255ea-282f-3ac7-b96b-37888c7f7bb7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Sharing your location on Instagram Map is opt-in. Your current location won&#39;t be shared on Instagram unless you actively choose to share it. What will be there are any posts that have a location tagged in them, something that&#39;s an option every time you add photos and videos to your Stories or your grid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram gives you four different sharing options for the Map. You can share with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Friends:</strong> Followers that you follow back</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Close Friends:</strong> Followers already in your Close Friends list</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only these friends:</strong> Specific people you choose</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No one: </strong>Don&#39;t share your location (except for posts with tagged locations)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So to disable location sharing entirely in Instagram Map, or change who can see your location:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the <strong>Instagram</strong> app.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on the <strong>DMs icon</strong> in the top-right corner<strong>.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Tap on the <strong>Map</strong> icon.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on the <strong>Location Settings menu</strong> (shaped like a gear) in the top-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>And then tap on <strong>&quot;No one&quot;</strong>, to disable location sharing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To change who you share your location with, follow the same steps except instead of choosing &quot;No one,&quot; choose one of the other options Instagram offers.</p>

<p>For even more granular control over location sharing, you can also add specific locations to a list of &quot;Hidden Places&quot; that will never appear on Instagram Map while you&#39;re visiting. If you want to modify that list, open the Map feature, then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tap on <strong>Location Settings</strong> (the gear icon) in the top-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on the <strong>three-dot menu</strong> in the corner of the settings menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on <strong>Hide Places</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap and <strong>drag a pin</strong> on the map to mark a hidden place, and then <strong>set a radius</strong> around it with the slider.</p></li>
<li><p>Type in <strong>the name</strong> of the place and then tap <strong>Done</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
