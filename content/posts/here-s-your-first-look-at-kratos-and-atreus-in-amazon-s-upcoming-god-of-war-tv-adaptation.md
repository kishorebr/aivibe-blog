<p>With the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-review-more-zombies-and-more-heartbreak-160007479.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html"><em><ins>Fallout</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>out of the way for a bit, Amazon has seized its opportunity to put the spotlight on the next big video game adaptation, its currently-in-production <em>God of War</em> show. Today we got our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2027398332482465882?s=20"><ins>first look</ins></a> at Ryan Hurst and Callum Vinson as Kratos and Atreus.</p>
<p>The image released by Amazon shows the eponymous God of War standing next to a tree as he watches his son — who notably looks  a bit younger than the video game version of 11-year-old Atreus we first met in 2018’s <em>God of War </em>— take aim with his bow. Exactly what they’re hunting is unclear, but we know that the developing relationship between father and son that was such a big part of the PS4 game is also going to be at the heart of the show.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios have nailed the looks of its central characters is a matter of opinion. Personally I think Hurst’s Kratos in particular looks a little bit off here, but there’s every chance it all comes together later in production. Or when we first hear him angrily exclaim &quot;boy!&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>star was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html"><ins>cast</ins></a> as Kratos back in January, and earlier this week we learned that <em>Deadpool</em>’s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/ed-skrein-cast-baldur-prime-video-god-of-war-1236734596/"><ins>Ed Skrein</ins></a> will play Baldur in the Amazon show. The rest of the cast includes Mandy Patinkin as Odin, Max Parker and Heimfall, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-adaptation-adds-teresa-palmer-201604602.html"><ins>Teresa Palmer</ins></a> as Sif, Alastair Duncan as Mimir, Jeff Gulka as Sindri and Danny Woodburn as Brok.</p>
