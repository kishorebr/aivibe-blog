<p>The new version of Siri that was demoed alongside <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">Apple Intelligence</a> might not be released until Spring 2026, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/apple-targets-spring-2026-for-release-of-delayed-siri-ai-upgrade?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>. Apple <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">officially delayed</a> Siri's release to some time "in the coming year" back in March.</p>
<p>The new Siri could be included in a planned iOS 26.4 update next year, which <em>Bloomberg</em> writes will likely arrive in March. Apple announced the smarter and more personal version of Siri at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-ai-ios-18-and-the-biggest-announcements-at-wwdc-2024-184422501.html">WWDC 2024</a> over a year ago now, and nearly two years before this hypothetical Spring 2026 release date. The company could demo the updated AI assistant again at its iPhone event in the fall or even release the new Siri early, but timing reportedly remains up in the air.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple's proposed update to Siri is supposed to give the company's aging voice assistant the authority to take action inside of apps and understand the content and context of your screen. The company's demos showed off Siri referencing emails for flight information and embedding photos in documents, all on its own, as evidence of how much more capable the assistant could be.</p>
<p>In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTLk53h7u_k">a recent interview</a> with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Apple executives attribute the delay of the new Siri to it simply not being up to the company's standards. Internally, <em>Bloomberg</em> writes that there's also disagreement between Apple's marketing and engineering teams as to who is really at fault. The company shouldn't have hyped up the new Siri at WWDC 2024 or built an ad campaign around features that might not ship (Apple's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-pulls-ad-that-showed-siri-being-useful-after-delaying-feature-that-could-make-siri-useful/">pulled its Siri ads</a> in March). But the engineering team may have been misleading as to how ready the assistant really was.</p>
<p>As testament to how careful Apple is being now, its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-announcements-at-wwdc-everything-apple-revealed-for-ios-macos-and-more-171133645.html">focus on AI at WWDC 2025</a> was far more muted. The closest the company got to touching on some of the magic of the new Siri was the updated version of Spotlight that's coming in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">macOS 26</a>, which can leverage the same App Intents framework Siri is supposed to use to perform select actions in apps, like sending a text in Messages without having to open the app.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html?src=rss
