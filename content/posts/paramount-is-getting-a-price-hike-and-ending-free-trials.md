<p>Paramount+ is making some changes that will make its streaming service get more to watch. During Paramount&#39;s earnings <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/53c82d68-0e50-45cf-a8b9-3023c5ce9cc7" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">report</a> today, the company announced that it will increase the subscription prices for Paramount+ in the US during the first quarter of 2026. Price hikes were also announced today for viewers in Canada and Australia. The new pricing was not shared, but a dollar or two more per month has become the standard change. Considering most streaming services jack their prices every year or two, the news was probably inevitable; the last increase for Paramount+ was back in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-is-raising-prices-again-for-all-of-the-tulsa-king-stans-out-there-183720943.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">June 2024</a>. But today&#39;s announcement also revealed that Paramount+ will no longer offer free trials, which is a common practice for most digital entertainment subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes appear to be part of a reassessment of the Paramount+ finances. The company&#39;s approach to increase long-term profitability &quot;includes shifting away from certain hard bundles and low-margin subscriptions, reducing investment in select international markets without a clear path to sufficient scale, retiring free trials, and reviewing discount practices.&quot;</p><p>These new moves follow Skydance&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/fcc-approves-skydances-8-billion-paramount-acquisition-032028104.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">acquisition</a> of Paramount over the summer, an $8 billion purchase which received regulatory approval after some pretty scuzzy interactions with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/paramount-is-getting-a-price-hike-and-ending-free-trials-231146302.html?src=rss
