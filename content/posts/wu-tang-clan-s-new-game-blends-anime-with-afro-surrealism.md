<p>Wu-Tang Clan has a new game. At <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/summer-game-fest-2025-schedule-announcements-new-games-and-everything-else-to-expect-183538568.html">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, Brass Lion Entertainment has introduced its debut game,<em> Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver</em>. In it, you&#39;ll have to fight alongside the group&#39;s members to defeat the invading forces of the Deceiver and to save your home of Shaolin. The game is an action RPG with &quot;anime-style fighting and afro-surrealist aesthetic.&quot; While you can play the game alone, you can also team up with up to two more friends online, and all of you can customize your fighting styles and your fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/06/06/wu-tang-rise-of-the-deceiver-game/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the group looked for a studio that can develop a game that can tie in with Ghostface Killah and RZAâ€™s upcoming film, the supernatural thriller <em>Angel of Dust</em>. That&#39;s when the members found out that Brass Lion&#39;s director of music and culture was American record producer Just Blaze.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bryna Dabby Smith, Brass Lion&#39;s co-founder and CEO, said Wu-Tang loved the concepts their company presented for the game. &quot;The script is in the horror genre, but it really worked from an interactive perspective,&quot; the executive told <em>The Post</em>. Brass Lion was co-founded by Manveer Heir (<em>Wolfenstein</em> and <em>Mass Effect 3</em>), Rashad Redic (<em>Fallout 3</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>) and Smith (<em>The Bourne Conspiracy</em>, <em>Sleeping Dogs</em>). Heir <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-brass-lion-entertainment-corner-wolves-interview.html">previously said</a> that the studio will focus on telling authentic underrepresented stories not just relating to race, but also to age, religion and sexuality.</p>
<p><em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceive</em>r will feature classic Wu-Tang tunes alongside new material, as overseen by Just Blaze. It doesn&#39;t have a release date yet, but you can watch a teaser below and look at some screenshots on its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763470/WuTang_Rise_of_the_Deceiver/">official Steam page</a>.</p>
