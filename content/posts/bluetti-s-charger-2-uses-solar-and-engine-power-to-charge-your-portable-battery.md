<p>If you’re off-roading, it’s a neat idea to use your engine to top up your battery, which prompted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/3-big-announcements-from-bluetti-at-ces-2022-175050612.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Bluetti</a> to launch the Charger. You could hook it to your alternator and draw off energy as you drove to make sure you turned up to your campsite with full batteries. But if you’re also toting around solar panels on your roof, then it’s a shame you can’t also use that power to top up. This omission is what prompted Bluetti to turn up to CES 2026 with the Charger 2, which will take power from your engine and your solar panels at the same time.</p>
<p>Bluetti says the Charger 2’s dual-input architecture will accept 600W from the panels, 800W from the engine. All of that power will charge your batteries significantly faster than the first model, claiming it’s 13 times faster than a standard car charger. In addition, Charger 2 can manage more than one Bluetti power station and expansion batteries, should your power needs stretch. And the system is smart enough to know where the energy is coming from, managing the sources based on their availability. Plus, you can use it to jump start your engine should you need the help.</p>
<p>If you’re a Charger 1 owner and want to upgrade, it’s fairly painless to drop the old unit out in favor of its replacement. It uses the same cabling, so you can just hook the new model to your existing wires without having to get your fingers greasy. To reward that loyalty, the company will sell you an upgrade for $99, at least through February 7.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, you’ll be able to pick up the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-charger-2-alternator-solar-charger__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Hup4QHaXiZAbBDrGvP6h21bZMpjKBCUfVIDR6_cFCutNYL_1H4cib59rfAOCtgC471jXE43c_TlNZ8eaMK3q$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Charger 2</a> for $349 through February 7, at which point the price leaps to $499.</p>
