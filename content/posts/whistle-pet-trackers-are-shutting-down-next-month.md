<p>Whistle, a subsidiary of Mars that makes pet trackers, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.whistle.com/blogs/news/whistle-joins-the-tractive-family?irclickid=QmNwb:3KcxycUPjR9Tw2iW5PUkp0aJ1hw0u6y40&amp;irgwc=1">has announced</a> that it&#39;s being acquired by Tractive. As part of the acquisition, Whistle trackers will stop working, but Tractive is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://tractive.com/en/fp/whistle?ranMID=45904&amp;ranEAID=2116208&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-XGK0kjvxLRlJJ_gbv.ebyg">offering to replace those trackers</a> for free for a limited time.</p>
<p>The official shutdown date for Whistle&#39;s pet trackers is August 31, 2025. Users will be able to request a replacement tracker until September 30, 2025 by providing their tracker&#39;s serial number and then choosing a new Tractive tracker. Tractive will also credit pre-paid Whistle subscriptions to new Tractive accounts, and give anyone with a Whistle tracker without an active subscription two months of a Tractive subscription for free.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whistle&#39;s devices, like the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-07-whistle-go-explore-review.html">Whistle Go Explore</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-whistle-fit-dog-activity-tracker.html">Whistle Fit</a>, focused on using GPS, Wi-Fi, and AT&amp;T&#39;s network to keep tabs on the whereabouts of your dogs and cats. Tractive goes further by offering similar tracking features alongside wearable-style health monitoring. If you pay for the company&#39;s subscription — a Basic plan gets you all the most important features for $108 per year — you&#39;ll be able to see your dog&#39;s heart rate, respiratory rate and track if it&#39;s barking more than usual.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re willing to pay even more, Tractive offers a Premium plan for $120 per year that unlocks things like &quot;worldwide coverage&quot; for its trackers and the ability export the GPS data your tracker collects. It&#39;s annoying to have to claim a new tracker and transfer accounts, but as far as acquisitions go, this seems like a best-case scenario.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/whistle-pet-trackers-are-shutting-down-next-month-212828325.html?src=rss
