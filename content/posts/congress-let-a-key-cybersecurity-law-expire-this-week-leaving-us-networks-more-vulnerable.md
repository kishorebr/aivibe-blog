<p>There&#39;s a long list of reasons US stability is now teetering between <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-fyre-festival-instagram-influencers-kendall-jenner.html">&quot;Fyre Festival&quot;</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-04-sirius-xm-to-debut-tiger-blood-radio-all-charlie-sheen-all-day.html">&quot;Charlie Sheen&#39;s &#39;Tiger Blood&#39; era.&quot;</a> Now you can add cybersecurity to the tally. A crucial cyber defense law, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015), has lapsed. With the government out of commission, the nation&#39;s computer networks are more exposed forâ€¦ who knows how long. Welcome to 2025, baby.</p>
<p>CISA 2015 promotes <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-27-us-senate-passes-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.html">the sharing of cyber threat information</a> between the private and public sectors. It includes legal protections for companies that might otherwise hesitate to share that data. The law promotes &quot;cyber threat information sharing with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework,&quot; a coalition of industry groups <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uschamber.com/security/letter-to-congress-on-the-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-of-2015">wrote</a> in a letter to Congress last week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>Cybersecurity Dive</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-information-sharing-program-expires-congress/761537/">explains</a>, CISA 2015 shields companies from antitrust liability, regulatory enforcement, private lawsuits and FOIA disclosures. Without it, sharing gets more complicated. &quot;There will just be many more lawyers involved, and it will all go slower, particularly new sharing agreements,&quot; Ari Schwartz, cybersecurity director at the law firm Venable, told the publication. That could make it easier for adversaries like Russia and China to conduct cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Before the shutdown, there was support for renewal from the private sector, the Trump administration and bipartisan members of Congress. One of the biggest roadblocks was Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. He <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/19/cisa-2015-cyber-law-rand-paul">objected</a> to reauthorizing the law without changes to some of his pet issues. Notably, he wanted to add language that would neuter the ability to combat misinformation and disinformation. He <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/03/cyber-law-cisa-2015-shutdown-00592501">canceled</a> his planned revision of the bill after a backlash from his peers. The committee then failed to approve any version before the expiration date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, House Republicans included a short-term CISA 2015 renewal in its government funding bill. But Democrats, whose support the GOP needs, wouldn&#39;t support the Continuing Resolution for other reasons. They want Affordable Care Act premium tax credits extended beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of the year. Without an extension, Americans&#39; already spiking health insurance premiums will continue to skyrocket.</p>
<p>In its letter to Congress last week, the industry coalition warned that the expiration of CISA 2015 would lead to &quot;a more complex and dangerous&quot; security landscape. &quot;Sharing information about cyber threats and incidents makes it harder for attackers because defenders learn what to watch for and prioritize,&quot; the group wrote. &quot;As a result, attackers must invest more in new tools or target different victims.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/congress-let-a-key-cybersecurity-law-expire-this-week-leaving-us-networks-more-vulnerable-174529522.html?src=rss
