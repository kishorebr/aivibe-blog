<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> (which is now basically all of November) is one of the best times of the year to pick up things for yourself and for other people. But to say money is tight is an understatement this year. If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else during these big sales. That, combined with the rising trend of<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:USA TODAY;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6cd347b6-53fa-4064-bedf-9e63f0ecfe98&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;linkText=holding+on+to+big+tech+purchases+for+longer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvMjAyNS8xMC8xMS9pcGhvbmVzLXNhbXN1bmctYW5kcm9pZC11cGdyYWRlLXByaWNlLXJlcGxhY2UvODY2MDg3OTMwMDcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2Y2QzNDdiNi01M2ZhLTQwNjQtYmVkZi05ZTYzZjBlY2ZlOTgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDI1LzEwLzExL2lwaG9uZXMtc2Ftc3VuZy1hbmRyb2lkLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJpY2UtcmVwbGFjZS84NjYwODc5MzAwNy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASCKYy4AzOp2Zb2Wv8FbrCDMu3CUb6gkS6vGnY4X4t2c&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2F2025%2F10%2F11%2Fiphones-samsung-android-upgrade-price-replace%2F86608793007%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/11/iphones-samsung-android-upgrade-price-replace/86608793007/"> holding on to big tech purchases for longer</a> means that you may not have gadgets at the top of your to-buy list this year.</p> 
<p>Even if that’s the case, I’d recommend not overlooking tech entirely this Black Friday. After all, all of us have essential tech that we use every day, and more often than not, you can avoid paying full price for most of those gadgets (and all of the rest of the<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html"> best tech of the year</a>) if you&#39;re looking to add to your repertoire or you need a replacement. Personally, I&#39;m not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
