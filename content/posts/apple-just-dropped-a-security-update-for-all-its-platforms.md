<p>With <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">iOS 26 coming</a> within the next month or so, Apple doesn&#39;t have many reasons left to update iOS 18. But this is one of them. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100">pushed</a> a security update for its platforms on Wednesday. iOS 18.6.2 patches a vulnerability related to image processing.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s security <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/124925">notes</a> say the update plugs a hole related to Image I/O. (That&#39;s a development <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio">framework</a> for reading and writing image data.) &quot;Processing a malicious image file may result in memory corruption,&quot; the company wrote. Apple said the vulnerability may have been exploited in &quot;an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ecosystem-wide update encompasses iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.6.1. There are also equivalent updates for iPads and Macs stuck on older firmware versions.</p>
<p>It can&#39;t hurt to update your device as soon as you get the chance.
