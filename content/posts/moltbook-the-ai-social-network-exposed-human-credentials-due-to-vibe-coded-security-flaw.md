<p>Moltbook bills itself as a social network for AI agents. That&#39;s a wacky enough concept in the first place, but the site apparently exposed the credentials for thousands of its human users. The flaw was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/exposed-moltbook-database-reveals-millions-of-api-keys" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">discovered</a> by cybersecurity firm Wiz, and its team assisted Moltbook with addressing the vulnerability. </p><p>The issue appears to be the result of the entire Reddit-style forum being vibe-coded; Moltbook&#39;s human founder <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/mattprd/status/2017386365756072376" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">posted</a> a few days ago on X that he &quot;didn&#39;t write one line of code&quot; for the platform and instead directed an AI assistant to create the whole setup.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the blog post from Wiz analyzing the issue, Moltbook had a vulnerability that allowed for &quot;1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses and private messages between agents&quot; to be fully read and accessed. Wiz also found that the vulnerability could let unauthenticated human users edit live Moltbook posts. In other words, there is no way to verify whether a Moltbook post was authored by an AI agent or a human user posing as one. &quot;The revolutionary AI social network was largely humans operating fleets of bots,&quot; the company&#39;s analysis concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>So ends another cautionary tale reminding us that just because AI can do a task doesn’t mean it&#39;ll do it correctly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/moltbook-the-ai-social-network-exposed-human-credentials-due-to-vibe-coded-security-flaw-230324567.html?src=rss
