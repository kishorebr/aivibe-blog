<p>We&#39;ve seen artificial intelligence give some pretty <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">bizarre</a> responses to queries as chatbots become more common. Today, Reddit Answers is in the spotlight after a moderator <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1o4bwx6/safety_concern_reddit_answers_is_recommending/?ref=404media.co" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">flagged</a> the AI tool for providing dangerous medical advice that they were unable to disable or hide from view.&nbsp;</p><p>The mod saw Reddit Answers suggest that people experiencing chronic pain stop taking their current prescriptions and take high-dose kratom, which is an unregulated substance that is illegal in some states. The user said they then asked Reddit Answers about other medical questions. They received potentially dangerous advice for treating neo-natal fever alongside some accurate actions as well as suggestions that heroin could be used for chronic pain relief. Several other mods, particularly from health-focused subreddits, replied to the original post adding their concerns that they have no way to turn off or flag a problem when Reddit Answers has provided inaccurate or dangerous information in their communities.</p><p>A representative from Reddit told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/reddit-answers-ai-suggests-users-try-heroin/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>404 Media</em></a> that Reddit Answers had been updated to address some of the mods&#39; concerns. &quot;This update ensures that ‘Related Answers’ to sensitive topics, which may have been previously visible on the post detail page (also known as the conversation page), will no longer be displayed,&quot; the spokesperson told the publication. &quot;This change has been implemented to enhance user experience and maintain appropriate content visibility within the platform.&quot; We&#39;ve reached out to Reddit for additional comment about what topics are being excluded but have not received a reply at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>While the rep told <em>404 Media</em> that Reddit Answers &quot;excludes content from private, quarantined and NSFW communities, as well as some mature topics,&quot; the AI tool clearly doesn&#39;t seem equipped to properly deliver medical information, much less to handle the snark, sarcasm or potential bad advice that may be given by other Redditors. Aside from the latest move to not appear on “sensitive topics,” it doesn&#39;t seem like Reddit plans to provide any tools to control how or when AI is being shown in subreddits, which could make the already-challenging task of moderation nearly impossible. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moderators-call-for-ai-controls-after-reddit-answers-suggests-heroin-for-pain-relief-230749515.html?src=rss
