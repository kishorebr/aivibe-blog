<p>OpenAI is reportedly hard at work developing a series of AI-powered devices, including smart glasses, a smart speaker and a smart lamp. According to reporting by <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Information;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a1f68853-5e71-4e10-bf8e-0cea589cc12d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;linkText=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaW5zaWRlLW9wZW5haS10ZWFtLWRldmVsb3BpbmctYWktZGV2aWNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTFmNjg4NTMtNWU3MS00ZTEwLWJmOGUtMGNlYTU4OWNjMTJkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaW5zaWRlLW9wZW5haS10ZWFtLWRldmVsb3BpbmctYWktZGV2aWNlcyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX16FgLwMJ_EpFRD8LxnYc3MDrlKQGXykl4o3VxfrFrL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Finside-openai-team-developing-ai-devices" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-openai-team-developing-ai-devices"><em><ins>The Information</ins></em></a>, the AI company has a team of over 200 employees dedicated to the project.</p>
<p>The first product scheduled to be released is reported to be a smart speaker that would include a camera, allowing it to better absorb information about its users and surroundings. According to a person familiar with the project, this would extend to identifying objects on a nearby table, as well as conversations being held in the vicinity of the speaker. The camera will also support a facial recognition feature similar to Apple&#39;s Face ID that would enable users to authenticate purchases.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The speaker is expected to retail for between $200 and $300 and ship in early 2027 at the earliest.

As for the smart lamp, while prototypes have been made, it&#39;s unclear whether it will actually be brought to market.</p>
