ZDNET's key takeaways GPT-5.1 speeds up coding with adaptive and no-reasoning modes.New prompt caching cuts API costs for embedded app developers.New tools make AI agents more capable inside modern IDEs.OpenAI is back with a new 5.1 update to its previous GPT-5 large language model. GPT-5 was introduced in August, which is decades ago in AI's time warp-speed version of our universe. OpenAI is, of course, using AI to help it code faster. After all, it's in a race with the other big players to get that trajillion-dollar valuation. Besides, it's been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that AI coding, in the hands of a professional coder, is an almost magical force multiplier and project accelerator. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)Also: OpenAI's GPT-5.1 makes ChatGPT 'warmer' and smarter - how its upgraded modes work nowFor an overview of GPT-5.1's benefits for consumer chatbot users, read Senior Editor Sabrina Ortiz' explainer. But if you're interested in using AI in your coding, or embedded in your software, keep reading. This release has some tangible speed and cost-savings benefits. In this article, we're talking about GPT-5.1 in the API. In other words, we're looking at sending prompts to the AI via a program's function call, and getting back a result as the return value to that call. This API-driven AI functionality works within the software products develop
