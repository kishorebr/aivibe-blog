<p>First, we got iPhones in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html">Hermès orange</a>, and now we might get them in Louboutin red. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple is already mulling over what the next premium colorway will be for its iPhone Pro models. While we&#39;re not expecting iPhone 18 announcements until later this year, Gurman reported that &quot;red is the new flagship color in testing for the next iPhone Pros.&quot;</p>

The bold orange option has been informally rebranded as Hermès orange among fans and is becoming somewhat of a status symbol in Chinese markets. With red as a potential frontrunner for the next iPhone Pro colors, Apple could capture even <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-smartphone-sales-china-plummet.html">more sales in China</a>, especially since the color is seen as lucky in Chinese culture.</p>

Previously, Apple manufactured iPhones in deep red hues in collaboration with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-gps-lte-product-red-edition-deal-amazon-123944170.html">Product Red</a>, with the last available models being the iPhone SE, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.
