<p>Following news that <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> is escaping its perpetual beta, the pioneering extraction shooter is also about to make its debut on Steam. Nikita Buyanov, head of the Battlestate Games studio that developed <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1962077634843558260">confirmed on X</a> that the game&#39;s Steam page &quot;will be available soon,&quot; only teasing that the full details will come later.</p>
<p>Buyanov&#39;s confirmation comes less than a day after the developer <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1961830502928724363">posted a GIF on X</a> of a man spraying steam from an iron. Earlier this month, Buyanov <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803">revealed on X</a> that the looter shooter will get its 1.0 release on November 15, 2025, more than eight years after the beta opened up to players in July 2017, and that the studio has plans to port it to consoles. The Steam page for <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> isn&#39;t live yet, and with only vague details to go off of, longtime fans already have burning questions. Most importantly, existing players are eager to know if they will have to buy the game again on Steam and how this change will affect the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/">ongoing cheating problem</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While we don&#39;t have any answers yet, Battlestate Games recently went into <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-devs-shameless-controversy-response-called-out-by-fans-and-esports-company">damage control mode</a> when it revealed the Unheard Edition of the game that costs $250 and includes a new PvE mode. This move irked longstanding players who previously purchased another premium edition of the game, called the Edge of Darkness, which promised access to all future DLCs. The controversy boiled down to owners of the Edge of Darkness edition claiming they should have access to the new content, but the studio argued that it isn&#39;t classified as DLC. In the end, Buyanov apologized for the debacle and promised the PvE mode would be available for anyone who purchased the Edge of Darkness package.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/escape-from-tarkov-is-finally-coming-to-steam-soon-developer-says-181356635.html?src=rss
