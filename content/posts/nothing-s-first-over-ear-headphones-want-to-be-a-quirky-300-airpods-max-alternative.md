<p>After numerous waves of similar (and not-so-similar) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nothings-ear-and-ear-a-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-are-now-available-for-pre-order-104546636.html">wireless buds</a>, Nothing is debuting its first pair of over-ear headphones. The Headphone 1 combines the company's recognizable <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/nothings-first-over-ear-headphones-leak-ahead-of-july-unveiling-150631940.html">see-through aesthetic</a> with an intriguing array of controls and up to 35 hours of listening with active noise cancellation (ANC). Handily, for its most premium audio launch yet, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nothing Tech - CA;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9bd6b6c7-25f6-4296-9274-99387edc5154&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3d6683e7-264e-4055-bd70-fe0192d7cbe9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nothing+Tech+-+CA&amp;linkText=%24299+headphones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vdGhpbmcudGVjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjNkNjY4M2U3LTI2NGUtNDA1NS1iZDcwLWZlMDE5MmQ3Y2JlOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3RoaW5nLnRlY2gvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd8khQPAsx9UOq8TIJc5sTL2RePw4_nGKzL1IiiynJUj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnothing.tech%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nothing.tech/">$299 headphones</a> accompany the launch of Nothing’s new flagship smartphone: the Phone 3.</p>
<p>First impressions are everything, and these look like Nothing headphones. Once again, the company has incorporated a transparent design element. There’s also an oval shape that showcases a portion of the hardware inside, layered atop an aluminum rectangle with curved corners. The two metal dots on each oval are part of the acoustic chambers, not button inputs as you might think. While the white option looks more “Nothing,” I think I prefer the black, which makes the company’s design choices slightly more subtle.</p>

<p>Nothing eschews touch sensors for buttons, paddles and a roller. The roller is a nice touch, offering a more sensitive way to adjust the volume, rather than abrupt level jumps. It can also be pressed to play and pause tracks. Long presses here switch the headphone between active noise cancellation and transparency mode. One unusual aspect is that the roller moves side to side, even when the volume fluctuates up and down. It feels a little weird.</p>
<p>Just below that, the paddle control acts as a track skipper, but also includes the ability to scrub both forward and backward, similar to an old-school rewind. The latter feature depends on support from third-party apps to work.</p>
<p>On the same headphone cup, there’s also a traditional button that acts as a shortcut to voice assistants and my favorite bit of Nothing software, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-essential-spaces-ai-powered-app-done-right-163042976.html">Essential Space</a>. Nothing has added a further boon when paired with Nothing phones, allowing it to seamlessly switch between recent audio apps without requiring you to touch your phone. (Naturally, you’re hostage to whatever was playing last or is cued up.) This feature will first be compatible with the Phone 3 before being rolled out to older Nothing devices. There's already support from the likes of Audible, Soundcloud and Patreon in addition to the usual music streaming suspects.</p>
<p>There’s also an almost secret Bluetooth pairing button on the inner side of the same ear cup. It’s nice that this is a dedicated button as you’re unlikely to unpair from using the primary buttons and controls.</p>

<p>Nothing has put work into comfort and fit, and as a mostly wireless earbud listener, I was pleasantly surprised at how the sub-12-ounce (329 grams) headphones felt. They’re almost two ounces lighter than the AirPods Max, which seems to be the product that Nothing is aiming to compete with. However, there are lighter over-ear headphones, including several Bose models and the Sony WH-1000XM6, which weigh under nine ounces.</p>
<p>There’s ample PU leather padding around the ear cushions and the headband, and the company says it should resist oils and makeup. In my testing so far, any sweaty residue was easy to wipe off. (I do wish the ear cushions were replaceable, however.) The adjustable arms also held onto the length I preferred while I was wearing them. I haven’t tested them yet while working out at the gym — they were under embargo after all — but over-ear headphones are an acquired taste for those who sweat it out while listening to music.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, Nothing has built custom 40mm dynamic drivers, with support for Hi-Res Audio, spatial audio with head tracking and ANC with four feedback mics. The cans also support dual device connection, allowing you to hop between your new Nothing Phone (3) and your laptop.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-passive-bookshelf-speakers-under-600-dollars-for-most-people-140057354.html">KEF</a> assisted with the acoustic engineering and proprietary tuning tools, apparently aiming to create a sound profile that reproduces music as the artist intended. According to Nothing, the team worked to achieve this across normal playback, ANC and Spatial Audio modes.</p>
<p>The Headphone (1) sounds a little bass-forward, but the soundscape is much richer than Nothing’s collection of wireless buds. Compared to the most premium headphones, though, vocals sometimes sound a little muddy. (In Nothing’s defense, these are pre-release units and software. If things improve, I’ll update this story.)</p>
<p>The updated version of the Nothing X app adds an 8-band EQ and the ability to remap the "Button" (an additional control, separate to the paddle and roller) to channel hopping, AI voice assistants, Noise control, Spatial audio and even switching to your favorite EQ preset.</p>
<p>Nothing says the Headphone (1) will offer up to 80 hours of audio playback, and up to 35 hours with ANC enabled. With ANC on — the mode I use the most for quiet middle-of-the-office listening — I got around that amount of time. You’ll be able to get over two and a half hours of listening from a five-minute quick charge.</p>

<p>The Headphone 1 has a divisive look. Ahead of the launch, I showed them to other editors at Engadget and some were baffled by the mixed use of square aluminum and circular elements. But, it’s different, and that’s Nothing’s MO. Its new headphones will be available for pre-order starting July 4, with sales kicking off July 15. They arrive in black and white color options, priced at<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nothing Tech - CA;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9bd6b6c7-25f6-4296-9274-99387edc5154&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3d6683e7-264e-4055-bd70-fe0192d7cbe9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nothing+Tech+-+CA&amp;linkText=%24299&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vdGhpbmcudGVjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjNkNjY4M2U3LTI2NGUtNDA1NS1iZDcwLWZlMDE5MmQ3Y2JlOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3RoaW5nLnRlY2gvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd8khQPAsx9UOq8TIJc5sTL2RePw4_nGKzL1IiiynJUj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnothing.tech%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nothing.tech/"> $299</a> (£299/€299).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-over-ear-headphones-price-release-date-173018845.html?src=rss
