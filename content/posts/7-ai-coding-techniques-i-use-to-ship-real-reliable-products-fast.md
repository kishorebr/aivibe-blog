    7 AI coding techniques I use to ship real, reliable products - fast
     
    What separates casual vibe coders from the elite builders? It's not prompts. It's systems. Here's the exact framework I use.

The programmer side is the practical side of my engineering identity, the person who crafts code line by line. The computer scientist is the theoretician, the scientist, the strategist, and the planner.While I love the theory and science of computers, I've always enjoyed the hands-on feeling of cutting code. I think it's probably akin to how some woodworkers prefer hand tools over power tools for the visceral feel of working with wood.  Also: Is Perplexity's new Computer a safer version of OpenClaw? How it worksUnfortunately, I've never had much time to code. My day-to-day job has been as a company executive, founder, educator, and writer. I do love making software products, but I've never managed to get more than one small product done each year, using little bits of available nights and weekend time.All that changed this past September. That's when I started using agentic vibe coding tools, such as OpenAI's Codex and Claude Code.  Since September, I've built and shipped four major products (WordPress security add-ons), built a working iPhone app for managing 3D printer filament, and am close to having a beta of an app my wife
