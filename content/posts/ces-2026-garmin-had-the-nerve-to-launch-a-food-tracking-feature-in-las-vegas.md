<p>Garmin’s big announcement for CES 2026 wasn’t another fitness watch. Instead, it revealed it is adding <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Garmin;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4c7f75f5-4803-438a-a506-12a0ccb4ede4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e8d55c66-4e69-42f4-a7af-b213555618ef&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Garmin&amp;linkText=food+%28and+calorie%29+tracking+to+its+Connect+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYXJtaW4uY29tL2VuLVVTL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2Uvc3BvcnRzLWZpdG5lc3Mvc3RheS1vbi10b3Atb2YtbnV0cml0aW9uLWdvYWxzLWluLWdhcm1pbi1jb25uZWN0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZThkNTVjNjYtNGU2OS00MmY0LWE3YWYtYjIxMzU1NTYxOGVmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYXJtaW4uY29tL2VuLVVTL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2Uvc3BvcnRzLWZpdG5lc3Mvc3RheS1vbi10b3Atb2YtbnV0cml0aW9uLWdvYWxzLWluLWdhcm1pbi1jb25uZWN0LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATT0_Q4IPp5Yo9xi8NP5nDLWIIj4bZPzVjx47a1zPO4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-release%2Fsports-fitness%2Fstay-on-top-of-nutrition-goals-in-garmin-connect%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/sports-fitness/stay-on-top-of-nutrition-goals-in-garmin-connect/">food (and calorie) tracking to its Connect app</a>. It combines AI image recognition with a rich food database, so you can monitor your calorie and nutrient intake without leaving the app — and even log some food through its watches.</p>
<p>The food tracking works similarly to existing apps like MyFitnessPal, Noom, LifeSum and many others. Still, Garmin hopes to make its companion app the best place for tracking nutrition without having to leave its app – and tying it into your other fitness goals.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This makes sense in a few ways. If you already use Garmin to track your exercise, the app can provide a more accurate estimate of your calorie expenditure. It’ll personalize it based on height, weight and gender, which you’ve likely already entered on your Garmin profile. It can even offer calorie and macronutrient recommendations tailored to your fitness goals.</p>
<p>However, it unveiled the news at CES 2026, a tech conference held in Las Vegas, which seemed like a troll. Las Vegas, where you’re never far from a three-foot margarita, a BLT Bloody Mary or fried chicken and waffles. In fact, Garmin selected one of my favorite restaurants, Yardbird, to showcase its new nutrition-tracking feature. Yardbird does incredible chicken and waffles. It’s possibly the worst possible place to start monitoring my calorie intake, regardless of the 15,000-odd steps I take each day here.</p>
<p>In addition to the food database, you can use the camera to log food. With AI-powered image recognition, the Connect app makes a generally good guess at what you’re eating. During the media briefing lunch, the app swiftly recognized grilled salmon, corn and several other vegetables. The quantities were not remotely accurate, however: Five kernels of corn do not equate to one cup. You can manually adjust the serving size, but unfortunately, it can’t make a more informed estimate at this point. A Garmin spokesperson noted that the company is looking into how to improve accuracy here. (It’s a common issue for any app or service attempting to use AI image detection to analyse meals.) It was, however, quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also create customized meal entries (with the correct ingredient quantities), making it easier to track your regular breakfast habits or midday coffee order. Better still, you can monitor nutrition and calorie intake on compatible Garmin watches. You can even log your favorite (and recently logged foods from your wrist without needing to use your phone. Voice commands also work on compatible Garmin wearables.</p>
<p>The feature is now available to Garmin Connect+ subscribers, who pay $6.99 per month. This also includes Active Intelligence, which already offers AI-powered insights into your workouts. It can now factor in your nutrition.</p>
<p>Subscribers will also be able to get daily, weekly, monthly and even annual reports on calorie targets (and what you ended up consuming). But let’s start monitoring that once I’ve left Vegas, please.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/garmin-food-tracking-feature-connect-plus-ces-2026-043231948.html?src=rss
