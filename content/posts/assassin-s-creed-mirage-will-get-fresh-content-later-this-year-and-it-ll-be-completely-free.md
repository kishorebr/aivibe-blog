<p>The Assassin&#39;s Creed fanbase may be waiting for the first DLC for <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows</em>, but Ubisoft instead confirmed new content for its previous title, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-mirage-will-arrive-on-october-12-205552847.html"><em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</em></a><em>.</em> The studio announced on the official <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735">Assassin&#39;s Creed X account</a> that there will be a new story chapter and missions for protagonist Basim, who will venture into ninth-century alUla. More importantly, the DLC will be free.</p>
<p>According to the post, Ubisoft will bring gameplay improvements to both the new content and the base game, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-mirage-review-a-warm-bloody-hug-from-an-old-friend-181918323.html">revisits the franchise</a>&#39;s roots that emphasize open-world design and stealth combat. The announcement from Ubisoft comes after a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626"><em>Les Echos</em></a> report earlier in the year said that new content for <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</em> was created thanks to a partnership between Ubisoft and Savvy Games Group, a gaming and esports company that has backing from the Saudi Arabian government.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The upcoming DLC sheds more light on what Stephane Boudon, one of the Ubisoft developers for <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</em>, teased during a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cbvteq/comment/l11etz0/">Reddit AMA</a> following the game&#39;s release in October 2023. In the thread, Boudon said the game was designed &quot;as a standalone experience without any DLC plan,&quot; only adding that the team had &quot;ideas of how we could extend the story of Basim.&quot; Ubisoft didn&#39;t specify exactly when the DLC would drop, only revealing that it would be &quot;later this year.&quot; In the meantime, Microsoft updated its included games for the Xbox Game Pass for August, which include <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-additions-for-august-include-assassins-creed-mirage-144428943.html"><em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-mirage-will-get-fresh-content-later-this-year-and-itll-be-completely-free-163728673.html?src=rss
