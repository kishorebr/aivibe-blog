<p>As of Friday, anyone trying to watch porn online in the UK will need to subject themselves to an awkward selfie or get their photo ID ready. The UK government announced it will start checking compliance with its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online Safety Act</a>, which requires any website that publishes or displays pornographic content to implement a system for &quot;highly effective age checks.&quot;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/uks-major-porn-providers-agree-to-age-checks-from-next-month">Ofcom</a>, the UK&#39;s media regulatory agency, offered a few methods for sites to provide more extensive age verification, including credit card checks, photo ID matching and even estimating a user&#39;s age with a provided selfie. Several popular porn sites, including the country&#39;s most-visited site PornHub, have agreed to the new regulations. Beyond popular porn providers, social media sites like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html">Reddit</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-is-adding-age-verification-features-for-users-in-the-uk-195753332.html">Bluesky</a>, have already implemented an age verification system that complies with the Online Safety Act&#39;s rules.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Savvy internet users are already circumventing the age checks by using a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">VPN</a>, providing a fake ChatGPT-generated photo ID, or taking a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/25/discord-video-game-characters-age-verification-checks-uk-online-safety-act/">high-quality selfie</a> of video game characters. However, the UK&#39;s new law also makes it illegal for websites to promote VPNs that get around age verification. To make sure the Online Safety Act is effective, Ofcom will fine companies caught breaking the rules with fines of up to Â£18 million or 10 percent of their global revenue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html?src=rss
