<p>Following a wave of lawsuits alleging that Roblox doesn&#39;t provide a safe environment for its underage users, the gaming platform made a series of sweeping updates to its policies. To address recent concerns, Roblox <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/extending-roblox-policy-on-romantic-and-sexual-content">published a post</a> on its website detailing these major changes, including restricting all unrated experiences, which is what Roblox calls its user-generated games, to the developer or those actively working with them. Roblox said this change will roll out in the coming months, representing a big shift from its previous policy that allowed users 13 or older to access unrated experiences.</p>
<p>To further prevent any inappropriate behavior, any &quot;social hangout&quot; experiences that depict private spaces, like bedrooms or bathrooms, will be limited to ID-verified users who are 17 or older. Roblox will also restrict social hangout games that mostly take place in those previously-mentioned private spaces or adult-only places, like bars or clubs, to users who are at least 17 and have been ID-verified. To assist with the new rules, Roblox will roll out a new tool that automatically detects &quot;violative scenes,&quot; or more simply, user activity that goes against the rules. According to Roblox&#39;s new policies, a server that hits enough violations will automatically get taken down and will have to work with the Roblox team to adjust the experience and get it back online.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These policy changes come after several lawsuits were filed against Roblox that claim the game doesn&#39;t protect its younger users. In response to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html">lawsuit filed</a> by Louisiana&#39;s attorney general, Roblox wrote in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">separate post</a> that it works to block any efforts at exploitative behavior and constantly enhances its moderation approaches.</p>
<p>&quot;Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue,&quot; the company statement read. &quot;No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/roblox-cracks-down-on-its-user-created-content-following-multiple-child-safety-lawsuits-193452150.html?src=rss
