<p>Panic is ready to show off some new games for its delightful <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Playdate</a>. The company will run a Playdate Update showcase on November 6 at 1PM ET on its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@PanicVideo/featured" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">YouTube channel</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://live.panic.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">website</a>. The stream will include a look at some upcoming games for the system as well as highlights from this year that are included in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.date/games/tags/on-sale/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Playdate Catalog Fall Sale</a>, which runs until November 13 at 1PM ET.</p><p>One of the items that’s on sale is Playdate Season 2, a run of weekly drops of neat games, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-fulcrum-defender-dig-dig-dino-and-blippo-140036697.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Fulcrum Defender</em></a> (from <em>Into The Breach </em>developer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subset-games-co-founder-jay-ma-went-through-hell-to-make-fulcrum-defender-153028909.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Subset Games</a>), puzzle platformer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-taria--como-and-black-hole-havoc-210042109.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Taria &amp; Como</em></a> and roguelike <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-shadowgate-pd-and-catchadiablos-130020943.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1"><em>CatchaDiablos</em></a>. The wonderfully strange cable TV simulator <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blippo-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-and-pc-in-color-september-23-160014279.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>Blippo+</em></a> is part of Season 2 as well. The season is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">on sale</a> for the first time at $31. It typically costs $39.&nbsp;</p><p>Panic noted that Season 2 has sold more than 15,000 units, which surpassed the company&#39;s expectations. Here&#39;s hoping Panic announces Season 3 during the showcase. I have my fingers crossed that the company will reveal a version of the tragicomic adventure <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/time-flies-hands-on-summer-game-fest-day-devs-140056653.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1"><em>Time Flies</em></a> (which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-terrific-2d-ninja-gaiden-housefly-bucket-lists-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110005806.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">it brought to Steam and PS5 this year</a>) for the Playdate as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Panic said the Playdate is in stock and available to buy for the holidays. Anyone in the US who snaps up the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.date/shop/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">$229 console</a> before November 30 will get free shipping, while tariff fees will be waived — the teeny yellow console should arrive in time for Christmas too.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-playdate-showcase-is-set-for-november-6-210034162.html?src=rss
