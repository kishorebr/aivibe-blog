<p>Elon Musk has reportedly fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's head of manufacturing and operations in North America and Europe, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/06/26/elon-musk-has-fired-one-of-his-top-tesla-lieutenants/">according to <em>Forbes</em></a>. Both <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/26/tesla-head-of-manufacturing-omead-afshar-fired-by-elon-musk.html"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/musk-confidant-afshar-exits-tesla-in-latest-high-level-departure?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> corroborated the report.

<p>Afshar was promoted to the role last year, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-16/musk-taps-confidante-afshar-to-oversee-tesla-sales-in-us-europe"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>, after working for multiple different Musk-owned companies since 2017. The timing of his exit isn't particularly surprising given the trouble Tesla has faced selling cars. Sales in Europe have shrunk for a fifth consecutive month and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association r<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-0-6-in-may-2025-year-to-date-battery-electric-15-4-market-share/">eports that registrations of new Teslas</a> dropped by nearly 41 percent in May.
