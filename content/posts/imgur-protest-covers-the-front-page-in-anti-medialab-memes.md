<p>Despite all the division and controversy rife in the modern era, sometimes the Internet does manage to collectively agree on something. Right now, they agree that they hate Imgur parent company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.medialab.la">MediaLab</a>.</p>
<p>After being <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697957/imgur-acquisition-medialab-kik-genius-whisper-worldstarhiphop"><ins>acquired</ins></a> by MediaLab in 2021, the once famously open-to-anything image-sharing service began placing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/imgur-to-ban-explicit-images-and-delete-uploads-not-tied-to-an-account-122537118.html"><ins>restrictions</ins></a> on content in 2023. More recently, the site has experienced service issues, including problems with notifications. Many members of the Imgur community have <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1mzsw9n/whats_up_with_imgur_raging_about_medialab/"><ins>claimed</ins></a> that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/even-asking-whats-happening-is-enough-to-get-comments-deleted-as-such-you-business-daddy-XYiPkt2"><ins>deleting</ins></a> or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/is-imgur-really-killing-itself-q8yAazH"><ins>hiding</ins></a> content that is critical of the owner and its policies.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab&#39;s poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/imgur-protest-covers-the-front-page-in-anti-medialab-memes-225502091.html?src=rss
