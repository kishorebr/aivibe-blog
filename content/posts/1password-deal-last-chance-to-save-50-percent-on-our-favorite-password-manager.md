<p>If cleaning up your digital life is on your New Year's resolution list, we've got good news: 1Password is offering <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100230748-17201697?sid=us-engadget">half off its subscription plans</a> (both the Individual and Families plans). That brings the price of the Individual plan down to $24 for a year and the Families plan down to $36 for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plans are nearly identical, but the Families plan accommodates five additional people. These discounts are only available to new customers and the prices expire after the year, so set a reminder to cancel or reassess. And you'll need to act fast, because <strong>the offer expires today — Tuesday, December 30.</strong></p>

<p>This provider topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/best-password-manager-134639599.html">best password managers</a>, and for good reason. We appreciated the intuitive interface and the fact that it's available on most platforms, so you'll never be left out in the cold. These include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and more.</p>
<p>Subscriptions include industry standard encryption and a "secret key" that only you know on top of a master password. There's also two-factor authentication and the platform issues alerts when credentials have potentially been compromised.</p>
<p>1Password recently raised prices across the board, but this is still looking to be the best deal for our favorite password manager going into the new year. The only downside here is the one that accompanies many password managers: There is no free version.&nbsp;</p>
