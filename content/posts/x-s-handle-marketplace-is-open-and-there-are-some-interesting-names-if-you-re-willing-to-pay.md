<p>After previewing its plans to open a marketplace to &quot;redistribute&quot; dormant handles <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-handle-marketplace-will-sell-some-rare-usernames-for-millions-of-dollars-224852740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">last month</a>, X has made the feature <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/XHandles/status/1991979559940767938" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">available</a> to all Premium+ subscribers on the platform. The feature allows subscribers to request new handles that up to now have been unavailable because they belonged to accounts that have since become inactive.&nbsp;</p><p>The marketplace offers two types of handles: &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;rare.&quot; For priority handles, X has suggested the goal is to give people the chance to have a handle that more closely reflects their name. In practice, though, it&#39;s not at all clear how X is determining what&#39;s considered a &quot;priority&quot; versus a &quot;rare&quot; handle. I signed up for a $40/month subscription and searched for both @kbell and @karissa only to be told that both are considered &quot;rare&quot; and thus not available to me. I was able to &quot;register&quot; my &quot;interest&quot; in the names, and include a brief description of why I wanted the handles.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-21_at_14.48.45.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-21_at_14.48.45.png" style="height:482px;width:887px;" alt="My first initial and last name is, apparently, &quot;rare.&quot;" data-uuid="464e7a82-5bc2-438b-8a6f-4b0bf406df5f"/><figcaption>My first initial and last name is, apparently, &quot;rare.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">X</div></figure><p>The company says that rare handles are &quot;the most valuable&quot; names and are &quot;often words, slang, or containing few characters. Some options that may one day be available, according to my searching, include @memelord, @phone, @gr0k and @AIchat. The exact process for acquiring one of these, though, isn&#39;t exactly clear. X says that handles on your watchlist &quot;may be released in a public drop where you, and others can apply to receive the handle for free via a merit based application system.&quot; The company has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-handle-marketplace-will-sell-some-rare-usernames-for-millions-of-dollars-224852740.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">also said</a> that it will make some especially sought-after handles available for purchase on an invitation-only basis, with prices &quot;anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-21_at_14.34.06.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-21_at_14.34.06.png" style="height:695px;width:952px;" alt="There&#39;s some good meme potential here, if you can get it." data-uuid="04a48597-bfb0-476d-ba08-7a5025c224fd"/><figcaption>There&#39;s some good meme potential here, if you can get it.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">X</div></figure><p>After a bit of perusing, I did find that there were a few entertaining options that are theoretically available now as &quot;priority&quot; handles, including @six_seven, @elonfarts, @grokfacts and @kbchat. Honestly, all of these were at least a little tempting, though I&#39;m not at all confident X would approve @elonfarts or @grokfacts. You also have to consider these requests at least a little carefully because X is only giving users the ability to request one priority handle during <em>the entire lifetime</em> of their account.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some significant strings attached to the whole process. In addition to being required to maintain a $40/month or $395/year Premium+ subscription, X has a rather strict set of rules for &quot;maintaining your handle.&quot; These include:</p><blockquote><p>-Create content regularly. If an account is active but the associated handle remains largely dormant – for example, where little or no original or engaging content is published – X may reclaim the handle.</p><p>-Use the handle in a way that reflects the spirit of participation and expression on X.&nbsp; That means active involvement in platform activities (replying, reposting, discussing topics) that help build a vibrant community for sharing ideas and expressions.&nbsp; X’s intent is to ensure that handles remain available for active voices and creators who help advance the mission of the platform, not for speculation or inactivity.&nbsp;</p><p>-Ensure regular activity on the platform, with a minimum of 1 device login within a 30 day period. For details, see our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-x-accounts" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Inactive Account Policy</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The terms also state that &quot;X owns and can reclaim any handle,&quot; which is more than theoretical. The company has a long history of commandeering desirable handles from users that were actively using them including, infamously, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190824506/the-man-who-once-tweeted-as-x-wasnt-informed-when-the-company-took-over-his-hand" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">@X</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all that, I still have yet to follow through on requesting any of the available &quot;priority&quot; handles I&#39;ve found. I might just stick with the same handle (@karissabe) I&#39;ve been using for the last 16 years. It&#39;s only two letters off from the supposed &quot;rare&quot; variation of my first name only, and it won&#39;t cost anything extra to keep.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-handle-marketplace-is-open-and-there-are-some-interesting-names-if-youre-willing-to-pay-000020665.html?src=rss
