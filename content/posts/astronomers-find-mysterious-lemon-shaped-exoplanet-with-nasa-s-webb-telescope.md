<p>Space is full of unsolved mysteries, and a team using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have recently turned up a doozy. &quot;I remember after we got the data down, our collective reaction was &#39;What the heck is this?&#39; It&#39;s extremely different from what we expected,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-observes-exoplanet-whose-composition-defies-explanation/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">said</a> Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington, a co-author on the study. </p><p>The researchers found an exoplanet dubbed PSR J2322-2650b that orbits a small, dense star emitting electromagnetic radiation known as a pulsar. They are an example of a black widow system, where a rapidly spinning pulsar is paired with a smaller astronomical body. A black widow duo isn’t unusual, but this pair has sparked questions about how the exoplanet originally formed. </p><p>The exoplanet&#39;s proximity to the pulsar and its intense gravitational pull have distorted it into an oblong lemon shape. More unusually, PSR J2322-2650b also has a unique atmosphere comprised mostly of helium and carbon. &quot;Instead of finding the normal molecules we expect to see on an exoplanet — like water, methane, and carbon dioxide — we saw molecular carbon,&quot; principal investigator Michael Zhang of University of Chicago said.&nbsp;Given its strange atmosphere, the team isn&#39;t certain how the exoplanet formed. &quot;It&#39;s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism,&quot; Zhang said. For now, we’ll chalk this up as another mystery of the universe.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-find-mysterious-lemon-shaped-exoplanet-with-nasas-webb-telescope-223722244.html?src=rss
