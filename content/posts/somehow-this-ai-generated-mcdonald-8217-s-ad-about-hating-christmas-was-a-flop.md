<p class="has-text-align-none">If you're having a stressful holiday season, the answer is McDonald's - at least, that's what a now-removed AI-generated ad suggested, as reported by <em><a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial" data-type="link" data-id="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial">Futurism</a></em>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Set to a song calling holiday season "the most terrible time of the year," the ad shows AI-generated people falling victim to a slew of wintery woes, including family dinners, shopping, caroling, baking cookies, and putting up a Christmas tree, each of which goes wrong somehow. The ad concludes by telling viewers to "hide out in McDonald's until January's here." </p>
