SoftBank and OpenAI announced&#160;a new 50-50 joint venture&#160;this week to sell enterprise AI tools in Japan under the brand &#8220;Crystal Intelligence.&#8221; On paper,&#160;it&#8217;s&#160;a straightforward international expansion deal. But SoftBank’s role as a major investor in OpenAI is raising questions about whether AI&#8217;s biggest deals are creating real economic value or just moving money in circles.&#160; [&#8230;]
