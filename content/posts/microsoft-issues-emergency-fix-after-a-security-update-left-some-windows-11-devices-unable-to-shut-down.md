<p>If you weren&#39;t able to shut down your Windows 11 device recently, Microsoft has rolled out an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#3763">emergency fix</a> addressing a couple of critical bugs that popped up with its latest January 2026 Windows security update. The latest &quot;out-of-band&quot; update repairs an issue for some Windows 11 devices that would only restart when users tried to shut down or hibernate. The same update restores the ability for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users to log into their devices via remote connection apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft said the inability to shut down or hibernate affected Windows 11 devices using Secure Launch, a security feature that protects a computer from firmware-level attacks during startup. As for the remote connection issue, Microsoft explained in its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2025#3760msgdesc">Known issues page</a> that credential prompt failures were responsible when users tried to log in remotely to affected Windows 10 and 11 devices.</p>

Back in October, Microsoft had to issue another emergency fix for Windows 11 related to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803373/microsoft-windows-11-emergency-update-usb-mouse-keyboard-recovery-environment-issues">Windows Recovery Environment</a>. For those still hesitant to upgrade to Windows 11, Microsoft is allowing you to squeeze some more life out of Windows 10 by enrolling in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-has-ended-windows-10-support-but-heres-how-to-get-an-extra-year-for-free-125118044.html">Extended Security Updates</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-issues-emergency-fix-afer-a-security-update-left-some-windows-11-devices-unable-to-shut-down-192216734.html?src=rss
