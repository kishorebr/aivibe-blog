Tutoring is one of the most effective tools for improving a child’s education, yet very few kids in the U.S. receive it. A 2023 survey of the nation’s largest school districts found that fewer than 10% of students received tutoring. One factor is that tutoring is too expensive for many families, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.

Tim Novikoff, a former Google product manager and educator, wants to change that.

The four-year-old startup is gaining traction. Novikoff says roughly 20,000 families have signed up for Super Teacher, and public schools in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii now use the app. Super Teacher is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.

Novikoff was previously a math teacher in New York City, first in Harlem and then at a highly rated public school, Stuyvesant High School. In an interview with TechCrunch, he said almost all the students at Stuyvesant received tutoring, whereas many of the students in Harlem didn’t, and the difference in their educational experience was stark.

Super Teacher’s app features animated tutors with AI-generated voices that guide students through interactive lessons. Students talk to the app using voice, like a conversation with a teacher. But unlike many edtech tools, Super Teacher doesn’t use large language models to generate responses. Instead, its content comes from a deterministic system designed to always give correct answers — avoiding the i
