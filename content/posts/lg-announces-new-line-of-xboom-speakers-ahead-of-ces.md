<p>LG just revealed several new speakers in the xboom line <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121511445.html"><ins>ahead of CES 2026</ins></a>. These speakers are part of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-xboom-speakers-hands-on-built-with-the-help-of-william-and-a-dash-of-ai-170030904.html"><ins>an ongoing collaboration</ins></a> with will.i.am from Black Eyed Peas, who is on board as the &quot;experimental architect&quot; involved with &quot;development, design and brand marketing.&quot;</p>
<p>These speakers are fairly different from one another, but they all have AI in common. Each speaker includes an algorithm that automatically adjusts the EQ after analyzing the audio content and the listening space. Many also feature an AI algorithm for ambient lighting, which will adjust the lights to match the song being played.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The xboom Stage 501 is intended for parties and karaoke sessions. It features additional AI that can remove vocals from &quot;virtually any song&quot; and even adjust the pitch. The battery lasts for around 25 hours and can operate while plugged in. The speaker delivers up to 220W of power, with dual woofers and full-range drivers. It boasts a five-sided cabinet design that allows for vertical and horizontal placement.</p>

<p>The xboom Blast is a boombox with a 99Wh battery that allows for up to 35 hours of continuous playback. That&#39;s a mighty fine metric. This is a modern boombox, so it&#39;s designed for durability. There are edge bumpers and a side rope handle for carrying.</p>

<p>The Mini is a tiny doodad that can be placed just about anywhere. It offers ten hours of battery life per charge and a strap for easy placement. The speaker also includes a built-in tripod mount.</p>

<p>The Rock is a, well, rock-shaped speaker that&#39;s larger than the Mini but can still be held in the palm of the hand. The battery lasts for ten hours and the design is focused on durability. It has been tested to &quot;seven military standards&quot; to ensure reliability in &quot;challenging outdoor environments.&quot; This is an upgrade of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/lg-xboom-go-xg2t-review"><ins>pre-existing XG2 model</ins></a>.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have pricing or exact availability on this stuff yet, though the speakers will be on display at LG&#39;s booth at CES. The company has said that all four of these gadgets will come out in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html?src=rss
