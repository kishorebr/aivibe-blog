<p>reMarkable makes some of our favorite E Ink tablets, and the company is running a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Remarkable;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1f7efcc9-4a08-437e-b0e7-e67043761cab&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=072547a9-20a0-4789-b412-91518e9eebb2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Remarkable&amp;linkText=Black+Friday+promotion&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlbWFya2FibGUuY29tL3Nob3AiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA3MjU0N2E5LTIwYTAtNDc4OS1iNDEyLTkxNTE4ZTllZWJiMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yZW1hcmthYmxlLmNvbS9zaG9wIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdHSZeiQ9rf8yyjY4sM26jBMdzrh4TFClaMVlV7-1aje&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fremarkable.com%2Fshop" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://remarkable.com/shop">Black Friday promotion</a> that discounts bundles by up to $70. The bundles come with the tablet of your choosing, plus a folio case and a Marker stylus.</p> 
<p>Both the reMarkable 2 and the reMarkable Paper Pro are on our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best E ink tablets</a>. The reMarkable 2 in particular offers a great reading and writing experience, with support for Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. It&#39;s easy to use and the screen looks great.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="33a17e6bbf5c4a20920ed461d2a618ec" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://remarkable.com/shop/black-friday"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The battery lasts around two weeks, which is one of the benefits of this type of display. It supports Wi-Fi and can integrate both PDFs and ePub files. It&#39;s also easy to create your own notebooks that keep track of handwritten notes. To that end, there are eight brush types here to mark up documents and take notes.</p> 
<p>The only major downside of the reMarkable 2 is that it doesn&#39;t ship with the company&#39;s newest Marker Plus stylus. However, this sale lessens that concern. A bundle with the tablet, the Marker Plus and the most simple case costs around $458, whereas the tablet by itself typically costs $399.</p> 
<p>There&#39;s a similar discounted bundle available for the Paper Pro tablet. This knocks $50 off the asking price.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/remarkable-black-friday-deals-include-up-to-70-off-e-ink-tablet-bundles-125523385.html?src=rss
