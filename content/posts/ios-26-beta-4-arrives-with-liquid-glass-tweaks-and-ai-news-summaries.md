Apple on Tuesday released the fourth developer beta of its next big software update, iOS 26, which brings with it slight changes to its Liquid Glass redesign and the re-introduction of AI-powered notification summaries for news, among other updates.

The rollout arrived just ahead of the iOS 26 public beta, which is expected to launch later this week.


	
	




	
	



The developer betas are meant to give mobile app makers time to test their apps with Apple‚Äôs new software so they‚Äôre ready for the public launch of the new operating system in the next few months. Because of consumer demand for early releases, Apple for years has been offering public betas following its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. This allows iPhone owners to also get their hands on the updated software before its wider, global launch, but with fewer stability issues and bugs.

The latest developer beta (iOS 26 beta 4) largely reflects what users can expect in the coming public beta. 

iOS 26 beta 4 introduces a new ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù splash screen when you first update the software, plus introductory screens for various features, like Siri and its AI-powered notification summaries and prioritization options, as well as for iOS 26‚Äôs revamped Camera app.

Earlier this year, Apple was forced to put its AI notification summaries on pause after complaints by the BBC, which said the feature had misrepresented one of its headlines. The AI-powered news summary claimed Luigi Mangione, the person charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide, which wasn‚Äôt true. As a result, Apple said a software update would be released to clarify when the text shows an AI summarization.

The setup screen for this AI summarization feature, still in beta, includes a warning message under the ‚ÄúNews & Entertainment‚Äù section. Here, Apple notes that ‚ÄúSummarization may change the meaning of the original head
