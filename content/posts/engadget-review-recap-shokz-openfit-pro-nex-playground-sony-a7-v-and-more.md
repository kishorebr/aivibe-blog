<p>We’re starting to hit our stride in 2026. Now that February is here, our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reviews</a> team is flush with new devices to test, which means you’ve got a lot to catch up on if you haven’t been following along. Read on for a roundup of the most compelling new gear we’ve tested recently from gaming, PCs, cameras and more. </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-nex-playground">Nex Playground</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="745ba4cf-6c3d-4164-b2f0-4fb6a0ff6b41" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?maas=maas_adg_27861A96B3EB230E7B0BB19CCA7340BA_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;th=1"></core-commerce></p>
<p>If you still have a fondness for the Xbox Kinect, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-nex-playground-is-everything-xbox-kinect-wanted-to-be-133000397.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Nex Playground</a> might be right up your alley. Senior reporter Devindra Hardawar recently put the tiny box through its paces and found an active gaming experience that’s fun for the whole family. “While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences,” he wrote.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-msis-prestige-14-flip-ai">MSI&#39;s Prestige 14 Flip AI+</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="cfde89ec-8780-450e-b862-e65bd6904c47" data-original-url="https://us.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Prestige-14-Flip-AI-Plus-D3MX/Overview"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Devindra also tested MSI’s latest laptop, the powerful <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-prestige-14-flip-ai-review-an-ultraportable-for-arc-raiders-thanks-to-intels-panther-lake-160000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Prestige 14 Flip AI+</a>. While the machine got high marks for its performance, display and connectivity, he noted that the overall experience is hindered by subpar keyboard and truly awful trackpad. “As one of the earliest Panther Lake laptops on the market, the $1,299 Prestige 14 Flip AI+ is a solid machine, if you&#39;re willing to overlook its touchpad flaws,” he explained. “More than anything though, the Prestige 14 makes me excited to see what other PC makers offer with Intel&#39;s new chips.”</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-shokz-openfit-pro">Shokz OpenFit Pro</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="3d87aebc-1e18-4188-8390-aa2ceec873a1" data-original-url="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/shokz-openfit-pro-open-ear-true-wireless-active-noise-reduction-earbuds-black/6665563"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Fresh off of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Best of CES</a> selection, I conducted a full review of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/shokz-openfit-pro-review-reducing-distractions-while-keeping-your-ears-open-130000443.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OpenFit Pro</a> earbuds from Shokz. I continue to be impressed by the earbuds’ ability to reduce ambient noise while keeping your ears open. And the overall sound quality is excellent for a product that sits outside of your ears. </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-sony-a7-v">Sony A7 V</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="bed279ab-ac98-46c3-a601-1a2eee041464" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Hybrid-Mirrorless-Camera/dp/B0G4SC4R2P/ref=sr_1_4"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Contributing reporter Steve Dent has been busy testing cameras to start the year. This week he added the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-a7-v-review-awesome-speed-and-photo-quality-130000592.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Sony A7 V</a> to the list, noting the excellent photo quality and accurate autofocus. “The A7 V is an incredible camera for photography, with speeds, autofocus accuracy and image quality ahead of rivals, including the Canon R6 III, Panasonic S1 II and Nikon Z6 III,” he said. “However, Sony isn’t keeping up with those models for video.” </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-airtag-2026">Apple AirTag (2026)</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="e18f6386-df66-42d5-a9c8-dcd780752738" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision/dp/B0GJTFXNRX"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Our first Editors’ Choice device of 2026 is Apple’s updated <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">AirTag</a>. All of the upgrades lead to a better overall item tracker, according to UK bureau chief Mat Smith. “There&#39;s no doubt the second-gen AirTags are improved, and thankfully, upgrading to the new capabilities doesn’t come at too steep a cost,” he concluded. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-shokz-openfit-pro-nex-playground-sony-a7-v-and-more-123400089.html?src=rss
