<p>X seems to be working again after struggling with an outage that took the service offline and made it slow to load for much of the morning. According to X’s developer platform <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://docs.x.com/status" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">page</a>,  there is an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://docs.x.com/incidents" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ongoing incident</a> related to streaming endpoints that’s caused increased errors. The incident started at 7:39AM PT, according to the page.</p><p>That roughly coincides with a spike in reports at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Down Detector</a>. The issues seemed to be somewhat intermittent. At some points, X’s website loaded partially and only showed older posts. At other times, the app and website failed to load at all. </p><p>As of 9:30AM PT, X’s Explore and trending pages were loading, but the “following” tab wasn’t showing posts and instead suggested users “find some people and topic to follow” (as shown in the screenshot below). </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-16_at_09.17.23.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-16_at_09.17.23.png" style="height:1004px;width:1258px;" alt="Posts aren&#39;t loading." data-uuid="1b6da8ad-43ef-4d26-bf41-5bb492f5cca2"/><figcaption>Posts aren&#39;t loading.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">X</div></figure><p>As of 11:15AM PT, X’s developer site was still indicating ongoing issues, so there may still be some lingering problems even though the website seems to be functioning normally again. Reports on Down Detector have also dropped off considerably.</p><p>X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the outage. As <em>TechCrunch  </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/x-is-down-for-the-second-time-this-week/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a>, this is the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/x-down-thousands-users-downdetector-shows-2026-01-13/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">second time</a> this week that X has experienced significant issues. The service also went down for many users around the world on Tuesday.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-16_at_9.20.35%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-16_at_9.20.35%E2%80%AFAM.png" style="height:446px;width:828px;" alt="Bluesky changed its profile photo earlier in the week." data-uuid="cdf68421-74b9-44f2-8a89-006f479c49a8"/><figcaption>Bluesky changed its profile photo earlier in the week.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">X</div></figure><p>But while the latest issues were widespread, some posts are were still managing to go through. Rival Bluesky, which earlier in the week changed its profile picture on X to its butterfly logo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">in a bikini</a>, took the opportunity to throw some shade. </p><p>At 1PM PT, X updated its status page to indicate the issue had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://docs.x.com/incidents" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">been resolved</a> after nearly six hours. It didn’t elaborate on the underlying cause.</p><p><strong>Update, January 16, 2026, 2:09PM PT: </strong>Updated with the latest information from X’s status page.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-fully-online-after-going-down-for-most-of-the-morning-171843711.html?src=rss
