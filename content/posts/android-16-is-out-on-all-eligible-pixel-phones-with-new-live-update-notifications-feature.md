<p>Google has released Android 16 to the masses, as it's now available for compatible handsets. The company says new devices will come preloaded with the OS in "the coming months." As usual, it's first coming to Google's own Pixel phones.</p>
<p>The update includes several notable features. The biggest one might be live updates in notifications. This means that stuff like ride-shares and food deliveries will get a progress bar directly in the notification, so folks won't have to constantly open and close the app to wonder why a burrito seems to be stuck four blocks away.</p>

<p>Also, notifications from the same app will now be automatically grouped together to reduce clutter and pings. There's now support for LE audio hearing aids, with a native control option. Users can also switch to the phone's microphone when using one of these hearing devices for clearer audio in noisy places.</p>
<p>Google has tied all of its security features together, so users can now be protected from "online attacks, harmful apps, unsafe websites, scam calls and more in just a tap." This includes new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-improving-scam-detection-and-its-find-feature-on-android-170037324.html">scam detection features</a> that were previewed back in May.</p>

<p>Shutterbugs are getting a fairly robust suite of new features, including automatic night mode scene detection, hybrid auto exposure and more precise color temperature adjustments. UltraHDR images have been improved, with support for HEIC encoding, and Android 16 offers integration with the high-end Advanced Professional Video (APV) codec.</p>

<p>The company is finally bringing <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/android-16-includes-a-desktop-interface-google-built-from-samsung-dex-213611668.html">desktop windowing to Android</a>, but it's not ready just yet. That feature will be available to general users later in the year, but Android 16 QPR 3 Beta 2 is currently previewing the feature.</p>
<p>There's also a neat Android ecosystem update with some nifty features. This includes upgraded RCS group chats, with custom icons and the ability to mute threads. Google Photos now offers an AI-enhanced image editor that will recommend suggested edits. Emoji Kitchen is receiving new sticker combinations and Wear OS devices can now pay for transit fares without having to open a dedicated app.</p>

<p>Finally, Google has offered details on the Pixel Drop for June. New features include a Pixel VIPs widget that displays information on preferred contacts and more expressive captions on videos.</p>
<p>Obviously, Android 16 is going to come to more phones than just the Pixel series. As noted by <em>Android Authority</em>, Motorola <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/motorolas-early-android-16-list-skips-some-surprising-devices/">released its list</a> of all its device that'll officially run the new OS. It's also worth being aware that there are <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://hothardware.com/news/android-16-is-glitching-hard-on-some-pixel-phones">some bugs being reported</a> on Pixel phones, so just keep that in mind if you're installing the latest version of Android.</p>
<p><strong>Update, June 10, 2PM ET: </strong>Well, we jumped the gun on that a little bit. Android 16 should now be available, as previously (and incorrectly) stated. We regret the error.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-16-is-out-complete-with-new-features-for-pixel-phones-including-live-notification-updates-170006935.html?src=rss
