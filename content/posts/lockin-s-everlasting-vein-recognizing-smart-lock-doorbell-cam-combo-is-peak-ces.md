<p>Smart locks have a notable inconvenience: running out of power. Lockin, maker of vein-recognition locks, debuted its newest model on the CES floor. It charges wirelessly via an optical infrared beam with a four-meter range.  A small device, connected to a standard outlet inside the house, shoots a beam at the lock, which has a small receptor panel that turns the light into power, sort of like a plug-in sun beaming at a tiny solar array.  The tech carries certifications from two independent organizations, and won’t harm eyeballs or bodies that get in the way of the beam (though if the beam is interrupted, charging stops). </p><p>The lock itself is a mortise lock that will likely require a pro to install, as it’s not just a standard deadbolt replacer. It’s not a standard lock in other ways too, with video and speaker capabilites, AI recognition as well as touchscreen features and vein recognition. </p><p>The tall black rectangle looked sleek (if huge) in person with a pocket-style grip and a rather sizable display on the interior panel. The outer panel has a touchscreen along with two cameras allowing it to act as a doorbell video camera. You can unlock the door via palm, finger vein or 3D facial recognition. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" style="height:1490px;width:2650px;" alt="Lockin V7 Max smart lock" data-uuid="26f0e007-e375-4979-baf2-0adda50fec1e"/><figcaption>Lockin V7 Max smart lock</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lockin</div></figure><p>It’ll feed the video to any of the major smart home eco systems, including those from Google, Apple, Amazon and Samsung. But for general setup and advanced AI features, such as recognizing a package delivery and speaking a canned request to the driver, you’d use Lockin’s own app. </p><p>I can’t imagine this high-end do-everything lock will be cheap, and indeed the price is currently undisclosed, but units should start shipping in July or August of this year. There’s a cheaper version of the lock, with the same wireless charging capability but without the video features, that’ll sell for $350 and will be available in April. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html?src=rss
