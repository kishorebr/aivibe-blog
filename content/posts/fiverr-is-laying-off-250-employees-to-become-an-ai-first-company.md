<p>Gig economy platform Fiverr is laying off 250 employees as it pivots to being an &quot;AI-first company,&quot; CEO Micha Kaufman <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/michakaufman/status/1967624550020985069">shared in an essay on X</a>. The move affects around 30 percent of the company&#39;s staff, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/fiverr_ai_layoff/"><em>The Register</em> writes</a>, and it&#39;s not uncommon among tech companies in 2025. Duolingo announced similar plans to become <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/duolingo-will-replace-contract-workers-with-ai-for-content-creation-123058970.html">&quot;AI-first&quot;</a> in April.</p>
<p>Kaufman describes this process as returning to &quot;startup mode&quot; and writes that his ultimate goal is to turn Fiverr into &quot;an AI-first company that&#39;s leaner, faster, with a modern AI-focused tech infrastructure, a smaller team, each with substantially greater productivity, and far fewer management layers.&quot; Part of the justification Kaufman offers for why Fiverr doesn&#39;t &quot;need as many people to operate the existing business&quot; is that the company has already integrated AI into its customer support and fraud detection programs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first sign that Fiverr might justify layoffs with AI came when Kaufman was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MPdmx-hiHA">interviewed by <em>CBS News</em></a> in May 2025 about the danger the technology posed to employees. Kaufman specifically advised employees to &quot;automate 100 percent&quot; of what they do with AI, while also claiming that wouldn&#39;t make them replaceable because they were still capable of &quot;non-linear thinking&quot; and &quot;judgement calls.&quot; That advice doesn&#39;t seem like it was ultimately helpful for Fiverr&#39;s own employees.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s cuts affect fewer people than a larger firm like Workday, who announced plans to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/workday-lays-off-1750-employees-citing-demand-for-ai-134922398.html">eliminate 1,750 roles</a> in February 2025. Regardless of the size of the company or its level of investment in AI, though, layoffs have the same effect: More work has to be done by fewer people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/fiverr-is-laying-off-250-employees-to-become-an-ai-first-company-215730063.html?src=rss
