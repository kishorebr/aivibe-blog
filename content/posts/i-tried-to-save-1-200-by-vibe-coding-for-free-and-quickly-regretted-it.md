    I tried to save $1,200 by vibe coding for free - and quickly regretted it
     
    I wanted to believe this free AI coding tool could replace Claude Code. But it isn't ready for prime time yet.

ZDNET's key takeaways Free local AI is promising, but wasted time costs more than subscriptions.Random, unexplained edits made the code worse each iteration.Without screenshots, fixing Xcode errors became a slog.Well, that's a bummer. After using the free and local (as in on my own computer) combination of Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder to build a simple WordPress plugin, I had high hopes that I might be able to give up my expensive Claude Code subscription and use a free alternative. To be fair, back when I was working on the test plugin, it took Goose five tries to get it right (more than any other AI), but it got there eventually.Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentPaying OpenAI or Anthropic a few hundred bucks a month to get their cloud AIs to write code for me is a fairly big expense. So I've been exploring the combination of Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder to see if, together, it might replace my Claude Code subscription. Nope. Nopity-nope-nope. The big frontier AI models ("frontier" means their investors want billion dollar valuations) use benchmarks like SWE-Bench Pro and GDPval-AA to support their claims that their offerings are the best ever. These benchmarks are certainly a valid approach to testing. Also: I built an iOS app in just two days with just my voice - and it was electrifyingBut I prefer a
