<p>LimeWire <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250915990798/en/LimeWire-Acquires-Fyre-Festival-Brand-What-Could-Possibly-Go-Wrong">has announced</a> that it&#39;s acquired the rights to Fyre Festival, the disastrous, influencer-fueled 2017 music festival. The newly revived company — which now acts as a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/limewire-nft-marketplace-no-crypto-090040288.html">NFT music marketplace</a> rather than a file-sharing service — bought the rights for $245,000 in an eBay auction, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/limewire-crypto-fyre-festival.html"><em>The New York Times </em>reports</a>. A separate plan to use the Fyre Festival name to launch a new music streaming service was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/fyre-festival-is-becoming-a-music-streaming-service-that-might-not-be-a-scam-this-time-221058381.html">announced in April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history,&quot; LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr shared in a press release. &quot;We&#39;re not bringing the festival back — we’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds like LimeWire might want to turn Fyre Festival into a physical perk of the digital collectibles it sells through its NFT marketplace. The company is planning to reveal &quot;a reimagined vision for Fyre&quot; in the coming months that &quot;expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experiences, community and surprise.&quot; During the height of their popularity, NFTs were frequently sold as memberships to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bored-ape-nft-event-at-least-15-attendees-reporting-severe-eye-burn-welders-eye-173746237.html">exclusive communities and events</a>, so if that&#39;s the tack LimeWire takes, it wouldn&#39;t be a particularly original one.</p>
<p>Of course, originality might not be the goal when a key strategy for your company is apparently acquiring and reinventing old brands. LimeWire&#39;s bet seems to be that the name recognition of buying a musician&#39;s NFT from LimeWire or attending a Fyre Festival event and not getting stranded in The Bahamas will be enough for some people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/limewire-acquires-fyre-festival-has-vague-plans-to-offer-real-experiences-200158421.html?src=rss
