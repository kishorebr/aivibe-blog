<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-has-hit-a-major-milestone-but-the-fights-just-begun-190431644.html">Stop Killing Games campaign</a> is evolving into more than just a movement. In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVKqRDalLo">YouTube video</a>, the campaign&#39;s creator, Ross Scott, explained that organizers are planning to establish two non-governmental organizations, one for the European Union and another for the US. According to Scott, these NGOs would allow for &quot;long-term counter lobbying&quot; when publishers end support for certain video games.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me start off by saying I think we&#39;re going to win this, namely the problem of publishers destroying video games that you&#39;ve already paid for,&quot; Scott said in the video. According to Scott, the NGOs will work on getting the original Stop Killing Games petition codified into EU law, while also pursuing more watchdog actions, like setting up a system to report publishers for revoking access to purchased video games.</p>

The controversial decision stirred up concerns about how publishers have the ultimate say on delisting video games. After crossing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html">a million signatures</a> last year, the movement&#39;s leadership has been busy exploring the next steps.</p>
<p>According to Scott, the campaign leadership will meet with the European Commission soon, but is also working on a 500-page legal paper that reveals some of the industry&#39;s current controversial practices. In the meantime, the ongoing efforts have led to a change of heart from Ubisoft since the publisher updated <em>The Crew 2</em> with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-crew-2-is-now-playable-offline-211629508.html">an offline mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>
