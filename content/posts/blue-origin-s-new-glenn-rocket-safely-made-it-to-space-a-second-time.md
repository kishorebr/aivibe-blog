<p>Blue Origin&#39;s New Glenn rocket has completed its second flight, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/13/new-glenn-blue-origin-nasa-launch/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Washington Post</em> reports</a>. The rocket launched from Florida&#39;s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday, and successfully separated from its first-stage booster, which later landed on a sea platform Blue Origin calls &quot;Jacklyn.&quot;</p><p>The launch marks the first time the space startup has been able to catch a New Glenn booster for later reuse. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-launches-into-orbit-on-its-maiden-flight-073451555.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">maiden flight</a> of the rocket in January was successful in the sense that it got New Glenn into space, but Blue Origin wasn&#39;t able to save the booster from a watery grave. The company hoped to launch its second New Glenn mission on November 9, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenns-second-flight-due-to-bad-weather-214349212.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">cancelled it</a> last minute due to weather.</p><p>New Glenn&#39;s second mission is also notable because of its payload: The rocket ferried <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/blue-origins-second-new-glenn-launch-will-carry-real-nasa-satellites-153000627.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">NASA satellites</a> to space that are destined for Mars as part of the agency&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/escapade/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">ESCAPADE mission</a>. Considering SpaceX&#39;s close relationship with NASA, Blue Origin working with the agency could be an important vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also mean New Glenn is in a good position to help another company founded by Jeff Bezos accelerate its satellite plans. <em>The Post</em> writes that Blue Origin has an existing agreement with Amazon to launch its recently rebranded <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Amazon Leo</a> satellites into space. Leo is positioned as a competitor to Starlink, SpaceX&#39;s satellite internet service.</p><p>While SpaceX has completed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">many more launches</a> with its Starship rocket than Blue Origin has, it&#39;s also had more than a few <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">explosive failures</a> along the way. Blue Origin still needs more missions under its belt, but if it can repeat its success with New Glenn, it could prove to be a threat to SpaceX.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-safely-made-it-to-space-a-second-time-230324439.html?src=rss
