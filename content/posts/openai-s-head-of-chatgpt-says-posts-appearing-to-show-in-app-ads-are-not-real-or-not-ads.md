<p>Those might not exactly be ads you&#39;re seeing on ChatGPT, at least according to OpenAI. Nick Turley, OpenAI&#39;s head of ChatGPT, clarified the confusion around potential ads appearing with the AI chatbot. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1997120491589349440?s=20">a post on X</a>, Turley said &quot;there are no live tests for ads&quot; and that &quot;any screenshots you&#39;ve seen are either not real or not ads.&quot; The OpenAI exec&#39;s explanation comes after <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/1996059933998285094">another post</a> from former xAI employee Benjamin De Kraker on X that has gained traction, which featured a screenshot showing an option to shop at Target within a ChatGPT conversation.</p>
<p>OpenAI&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/_dmca/status/1996377763989877018">Daniel McAuley</a> responded to the post, arguing that it&#39;s not an ad but rather an example of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/">app integration</a> that the company announced in October. However, the company&#39;s chief research officer, Mark Chen, also replied on X that they &quot;fell short&quot; in this case, adding that &quot;anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision,&quot; Chen wrote on X. &quot;We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty about whether OpenAI will introduce ads to ChatGPT, but in November, someone <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/code-suggests-that-openai-may-be-close-to-introducing-ads-for-chatgpt-172511090.html">discovered code</a> in a beta version of the ChatGPT app on Android that made several mentions of ads. Even in Turley&#39;s post debunking the inclusion of live ads, the OpenAI exec added that &quot;if we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach.&quot; Turley also posted that &quot;people trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-head-of-chatgpt-says-posts-appearing-to-show-in-app-ads-are-not-real-or-not-ads-190454584.html?src=rss
