<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-deal-get-75-percent-off-two-year-plans-before-black-friday-153737908.html?src=rss
