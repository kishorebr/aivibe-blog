<p>After largely focusing <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html"><ins>Google I/O 2025</ins></a> on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html"><ins>searching the web</ins></a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-filmmaking-tool-flow-ai-generated-video-175212520.html"><ins>filmmaking</ins></a>, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-next-made-by-google-event-better-known-as-the-pixel-launch-is-set-for-august-20-162832319.html"><ins>August 20</ins></a>, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-shows-off-the-pixel-10-less-than-a-month-before-its-launch-203924194.html"><ins>Pixel 10</ins></a> phones will look like.</p>
<p>As in past years, Google isn&#39;t the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. Nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has leaked in one form or another ahead of the event. With that in mind and after sifting through what&#39;s leaked, here&#39;s what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-pixel-10-10-pro-10-pro-xl-and-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/81750690-6809-11f0-afef-b0e17afb8a6a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/81750690-6809-11f0-afef-b0e17afb8a6a" style="height:799px;width:1420px;" alt="A render of the front and back of the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro." data-uuid="b8dfd357-c02c-374f-bb7b-34eab22eb6c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Android Headlines / Onleaks </div></figure>
<p>Google&#39;s invitation for the event says that the company is sharing &quot;the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,‚Äù which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that&#39;s similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-xl"><ins>leaked renders</ins></a> have already signaled: the company isn&#39;t abandoning the new design language the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9-review-the-go-to-android-smartphone-133005548.html"><ins>Pixel 9</ins></a> established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone&#39;s back.</p>
<p>Those subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they&#39;ll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/exclusive-official-google-pixel-10-series-dimensions.html"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Android Headlines</ins></em></a>. Google&#39;s new Pixels are also supposed to come in <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-colors"><ins>new colors</ins></a>. The Pixel 10 will come in &quot;Frost&quot; (a royal blue), &quot;Lemongrass&quot; (a yellow), &quot;Indigo&quot; (a light purple) and &quot;Obsidian&quot; (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, &quot;Porcelain&quot; (off-white), &quot;Moonstone&quot; (a bluish gray) and &quot;Jade&quot; (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it&#39;ll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/bf9e91c0-6809-11f0-bfff-5230b574adef" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/bf9e91c0-6809-11f0-bfff-5230b574adef" style="height:799px;width:1420px;" alt="A leaked imaged of a blue Pixel 10, a green Pixel 10 Pro, a white Pixel 10 Pro XL and a gray Pixel 10 Pro Fold." data-uuid="aa3aec32-3a71-3026-bac5-7c7cce0420e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Android Headlines</div></figure>
<p>The most visible external change that&#39;ll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10-camera-details-3540182/"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em><ins> reports</ins></a>, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.</p>
<p>Inside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It&#39;s likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/"><ins>Reports suggest</ins></a> the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/24380c60-680a-11f0-bf6c-f06efaf95550" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/24380c60-680a-11f0-bf6c-f06efaf95550" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A render of the black Pixel Watch 4, in two different sizes." data-uuid="4f2c1fee-78b2-322c-9f69-a575f9fb6b9a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">91mobiles / Onleaks</div></figure>
<p>The third time was the charm for the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-review-google-finally-got-it-right-especially-with-the-battery-life-170005758.html"><ins>Pixel Watch 3</ins></a>, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-pixel-watch-4-could-be-thicker-and-offer-wireless-charging-164555210.html"><ins>new smartwatches</ins></a> have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-4-design-renders-video/"><em><ins>91mobiles</ins></em></a> do suggest Google has a few changes planned.</p>
<p>Namely, much like the company&#39;s phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it&#39;ll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but a thicker frame that could accommodate a larger battery, or a new wireless charging system. Notably, the renders are missing the charging pins used on the Pixel Watch 3.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on-new-look-new-ai-and-new-antioxidants-140039472.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</ins></a>, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn&#39;t be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-pixel-buds-2a">Pixel Buds 2a</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/91794190-680a-11f0-bfeb-debb5f976185" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/91794190-680a-11f0-bfeb-debb5f976185" style="height:4320px;width:7680px;" alt="The green Pixel Buds A-Series wireless earbuds with their case open and one earbuds popped out." data-uuid="4db54371-7aed-331e-8a4b-8f5d7afe0925"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Google launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn&#39;t update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-leak-tells-us-new-color-options-and-a-surprise-option-for-the-pro-2"><em><ins>Tom&#39;s Guide</ins></em><ins> reports</ins></a> Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.</p>
<p>Unlike the company&#39;s premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There&#39;s little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-pixelsnap">Pixelsnap</h2>
<p>The Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn&#39;t been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple&#39;s MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google&#39;s adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixelsnap-googles-belated-answer-to-magsafe-could-arrive-alongside-the-pixel-10-184527063.html"><ins>&quot;Pixelsnap.&quot;</ins></a></p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-qi-2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories-3566103/"><ins>A report from </ins><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. Adding some weight to the report, the <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html"><ins>Wireless Power Consortium has announced</ins></a> that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to &quot;major Android phones.&quot; It would make sense if Google&#39;s Pixel 10s were included.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-gemini-and-other-exclusive-software-features">Gemini and other exclusive software features</h2>
<p>Gemini is Google&#39;s current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops ‚Äî Google&#39;s regular Pixel-focused software updates ‚Äî have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.</p>
