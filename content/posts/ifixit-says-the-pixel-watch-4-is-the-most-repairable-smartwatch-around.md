<p>When Google <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-pixel-watch-4-offers-better-battery-life-and-easier-screen-replacements-160053246.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> the Pixel Watch 4, it made a point to mention that the smartwatch was &quot;designed with serviceability in mind.&quot; Now that it&#39;s out, the repair experts at iFixit have taken a look and can confirm Google&#39;s claims.

(That said, the Fairphone 6 did recently receive a perfect 10/10 repairability <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fairphone-6-lands-a-perfect-10-for-repairability-190001687.html"><ins>review</ins></a>.) But iFixit said it was &quot;truly impressed&quot; with what owners can do to fix Google’s latest wearable on their own.</p>

<p>The first thing it highlights is the presence of visible screws that don’t interfere with the watch’s IP68 water and dust resistance rating. Both the vibration motor and battery are also easy to remove, the latter being glue-free and requiring you only to unscrew from its enclosure. As for the display, that’s also secured by screws alone (spotting a pattern here yet?) and sealed using a replaceable O-ring gasket that you can easily purchase. iFixit notes that it’s harder for square watches to use the same solution, so Google’s decision to make the Pixel Watch 4 round boosts its repairability.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the end of its comprehensive video, iFixit awards Google a provisional rating of 9/10 for repairability, calling it &quot;the most satisfying smartwatch teardown&quot; it has performed to date. For transparency, the site points out that it does have an ongoing business partnership with Google, but insists it’s completely unrelated to the teardown treatment it gives the Pixel Watch 4.</p>
<p>Its perhaps surprising level of repairability isn’t the only thing in the Pixel Watch 4’s favor.
