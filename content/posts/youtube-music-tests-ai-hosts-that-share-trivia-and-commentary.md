YouTube Music is testing AI music hosts that provide relevant stories, fan trivia, and commentary about what you’re listening to, the company announced on Friday.

The move comes two years after Spotify launched an AI DJ that delivers a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like. 


	
	




	
	



YouTube Music’s new feature builds on its ongoing experiments with conversational AI. In July, the service rolled out an AI conversational radio feature that lets users create a custom radio station by describing what they want to hear.

YouTube Music’s new AI hosts are currently being tested through YouTube Labs, the platform’s new hub for AI experiments. In a blog post, the company said YouTube Labs is “a new initiative dedicated to exploring the potential of AI on YouTube.”

YouTube Labs is similar to Google Labs, Google’s experimental arm that lets users test early-stage AI products and provide feedback. 

YouTube Labs is open to all YouTube users, which means they don’t need a Premium membership to sign up. However, the company notes that only a limited number of U.S.-based participants will be given access to the experimental program.

YouTube Labs has been implementing AI features across YouTube recently.
