<p>Remedy&#39;s multiplayer spin on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-control-hands-on-e3-2019.html"><em>Control</em></a> is coming to the PlayStation Game Catalog. Sony&#39;s June PS Plus additions start with the day-one arrival of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Other entries this month include the latest Battlefield entry and sticky-ball Katamari fun.</p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> lets you and up to two others team up to kick some Hiss ass. Play as a government employee who volunteered to take out extra-dimensional monsters. But the wicked delights <em>really</em> kick in when you enhance your plain ol&#39; guns with supernatural gear.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In our preview, Engadget&#39;s Jessica Conditt saw <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/fbc-firebreak-preview-controlled-chaos-183106500.html">a promising and &quot;incredibly fun&quot; shooter</a> that only needed a bit of fine-tuning before launch. &quot;<em>Firebreak</em> is poised to be a thoughtful and focused entry in the co-op shooter genre, and it&#39;s already an inviting extension of Remedy&#39;s darkest and silliest sensibilities,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will be available in the Game Catalog on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-comes-out-june-17-190054471.html">its launch day</a>, June 17. You&#39;ll need a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership to claim it.</p>

<p>Also coming on that date is <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. This could be a good time to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2024-ui-bug-fix-update-3-201300738.html">catch up on the franchise</a> before its next installment. (It&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-next-battlefield-game-will-launch-sometime-before-april-2026-161521602.html">expected by April 2026</a>.) Also arriving this month is <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-13-katamari-damacy-reroll-nintendo-switch.html"><em>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie</em></a>. Who doesn&#39;t love rolling a satisfyingly growing blob of random shit?</p>
<p>Both of those titles require a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership. Ditto for other June entries like <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2</em> and <em>theHunter: Call of the Wild</em>. Meanwhile, the 2000 classic <em>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy</em> will only be available for Premium subscribers.
