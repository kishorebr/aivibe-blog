<p>Known for its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneos-kun-gaming-handheld-review-164050984.html">premium handhelds</a> that often go for more than $1,000, Ayaneo announced a higher-end version of the first handheld to release under its more affordable sub-brand called KONKR. Ayaneo revealed the new Android gaming handheld, called the Pocket Fit Elite, in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCS04Y2jniI">YouTube video</a> that detailed most of its specs.</p>
<div id="33130e1a6a0141a38d7205913d31db04"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCS04Y2jniI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Pocket Fit Elite will be built with a six-inch 1080p display that has a 144Hz refresh rate, an 8,000 mAh battery, and Hall effect joysticks and triggers. However, Ayaneo didn&#39;t confirm what processor it will use for the Pocket Fit Elite, whose name could be a nod towards the inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. We&#39;re expecting a more powerful chip than the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/next-gen-snapdragon-g-series-chips-will-power-handhelds-from-ayaneo-onexsugar-and-retroid-pocket-131733930.html">Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</a>, which Ayaneo said will be used for the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/891">Pocket Fit base model</a> that was announced in July. Looking at the two models, the unrevealed processor for the Pocket Fit Elite will be the main difference.</p>

Ayaneo said in its latest YouTube video that it&#39;s in the final preparation stage for the Pocket Fit launch, which will be sometime in September.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-premium-handheld-from-ayaneos-budget-brand-arrives-in-september-183533792.html?src=rss
