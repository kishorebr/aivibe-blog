<p>Google is getting ready to spend $40 billion to increase its data center footprint in Texas. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-american-innovation-texas/">an announcement</a> posted on its website, Google said it&#39;s planning to build more infrastructure for its cloud and artificial intelligence operations in the state. The plans call for three new data centers, one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County, according to Google.</p>
<p>According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-google-announce-40-billion-investment-in-texas">press release</a> from Texas Governor Greg Abbott, this is Google&#39;s largest investment in any US state. The tech giant&#39;s investment in the Lone Star State dates back to 2019, when it built a data center in Midlothian, Texas. Google later expanded its presence in the state with the development of another data center in Red Oak, bringing the company&#39;s total investment into Texas to $2.7 billion. According to Google, the latest $40 billion investment will be made through 2027.</p>
