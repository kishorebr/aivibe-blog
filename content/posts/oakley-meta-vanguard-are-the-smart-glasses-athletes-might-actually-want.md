<p>When Meta announced its first pair of Oakley-branded sunglasses, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html">the HSTN frames</a>, earlier this year, it called them "performance AI" glasses even though they only came with modest upgrades compared with Meta's Ray-Ban lineup. But the new Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, which were <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d1133324-3c44-41da-9dcf-594930fd4e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=just+unveiled&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL29ha2xleS1tZXRhLXZhbmd1YXJkLXByZS1vcmRlci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1haS1nbGFzc2VzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDExMzMzMjQtM2M0NC00MWRhLTlkY2YtNTk0OTMwZmQ0ZTdmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL29ha2xleS1tZXRhLXZhbmd1YXJkLXByZS1vcmRlci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1haS1nbGFzc2VzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcxqE3VhfxXmJLPqtN_b5q8uyahAtfaOTIAm7XpV-NSL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Foakley-meta-vanguard-pre-order-performance-ai-glasses%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/blog/oakley-meta-vanguard-pre-order-performance-ai-glasses/">just unveiled</a> at Connect, are much more clearly aimed at serious athletes and they have the features to back it up.</p> 
<p>The $499 sunglasses feature Oakley's familiar wraparound frames and shiny (swappable) lenses. They are the first of Meta's smart glasses to change the placement of the camera, which is now in the center of the frames above the nose. According to Meta, this should make it harder for a hat or a helmet to ruin your shots, which was a consistent issue for me with the HSTN glasses.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Meta is making other camera adjustments that should make the glasses more reliable for capturing first-person action cam-style footage. The 12 megapixel camera now has a wider, 122-degree angle lens and adjustable video stabilization. There are also now dedicated modes for capturing slow motion videos as well as Instagram-ready hyperlapse slips.</p> 
<p>There are other spec upgrades too. Battery life has been improved to six hours of continuous music playback and nine hours of "mixed use". The charging case can provide another 36 hours of battery life. Meta also told me the glasses have been optimized for a wider range of temperatures, so the battery should hold up better in very cold or very hot environments.</p>

<p>The onboard speakers are more powerful. Mark Zuckerberg said during the Connect presentation that the open-ear speakers are 6 decibels louder than before. He said he took a call on a jet ski "a few weeks ago... it was great."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I cranked up the volume during my demo, I had to pause the music in order to hear the person next to me speaking. The glasses are also much more water resistant than their predecessors, with an IP67 rating that means they can be fully submerged.</p> 
<p>Meta has also changed up the button placement on the glasses, putting the capture button on the bottom right side of the glasses instead of the top. There's also a new "action button" that's particularly intriguing. This is a customizable button that users can program to trigger specific actions. For example, it could start playing a specific Spotify playlist or it could trigger a hyperlapse video. It can also be mapped to actions that take advantage of Meta AI, like providing a surf report or identifying what you're looking at. I'm not sure what I would use this button for, but I'm looking forward to trying it out when I get my hands on a pair for more than a few minutes.</p> 
<p>The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses will come with integrations for Strava and Garmin. In my demo, I walked on a treadmill while wearing a Garmin watch and the Vanguard glasses. This meant I could ask Meta AI for info about my heart rate and my pace. If you're a Strava user, you can overlay photos and videos from your run onto the stats you get at the end of your run.</p> 
<p>Like the HSTN glasses, I have a feeling the Vanguard frames could be a bitâ€¦ polarizing. Most people do not want to wear big wraparound sunglasses for daily activities. I definitely don't! But Meta has added enough new features that the $499 sunglasses might actually make sense for athletes. I've been wearing Oakley ski goggles for years and I suspect a pair of Vanguard glasses could easily replace them in most conditions.</p> 
<p>The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are available now for pre-order. They officially go on sale October 21.</p>
