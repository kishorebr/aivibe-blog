<p><em>Apex Legends </em>developer Respawn said it&#39;s ending Nintendo Switch support for the game this summer, with the release of Season 30. After that point, it&#39;ll work with the Switch 2 and all other currently supported platforms, but not the original Switch. &quot;Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch,&quot; the team wrote in a post on X.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="width:608px;height:413px;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey legends, we want to share an important update about Apex Legends on the Nintendo Switch. <br><br>Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. Future seasons of Apex Legends will continue to be available on Nintendo Switch 2.<br><br>- Starting August 4, 2026…</p>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/2017296851247018038?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote>


</div><p>The change will take place on August 4, 2026, so Switch players still have several months left to enjoy <em>Apex Legends </em>on the console and make preparations for their shift to a different platform, if they plan to do so. &quot;All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts,&quot; Respawn said. &quot;Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The Switch 2 undoubtedly offers a better playing experience for <em>Apex Legends </em>than the earlier model, but the news is still a blow for current Switch 1 players who didn&#39;t have plans of upgrading any time soon. <em>Apex Legends</em> first came to Switch in 2021, two years after the game&#39;s launch on other platforms.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/apex-legends-wont-be-playable-on-nintendo-switch-after-its-next-season-214153353.html?src=rss
