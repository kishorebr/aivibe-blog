<p>There’s a fine line between luxurious and ludicrous. When you’re talking about a pair of $799 headphones, that line begins to blur. Bowers &amp; Wilkins has been on an excellent run of form <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px7-s3-review-a-sonic-powerhouse-only-slightly-improved-130027301.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">over the past few years</a>, consistently offering some of the best sound quality <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">you’ll find on any headphones</a>. It doesn’t load its models down with features — sometimes it could use a few more — but there’s always a great blend of design, audio performance and capable active noise cancellation (ANC) that make for well-rounded products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there’s <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FH5QDTBQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=66e1580b-7e40-41f0-9fa5-767a9b2fd6eb&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=the+Px8+S2&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Jvd2Vycy1XaWxraW5zLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1UcmFuc3BhcmVuY3kvZHAvQjBGSDVRRFRCUS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjZlMTU4MGItN2U0MC00MWYwLTlmYTUtNzY3YTliMmZkNmViIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Jvd2Vycy1XaWxraW5zLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1UcmFuc3BhcmVuY3kvZHAvQjBGSDVRRFRCUS8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXtDvOzPrBMHRf5B8zUJclcc_OJ6GX-FLHNV6L9kxiv6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancelling-Transparency%2Fdp%2FB0FH5QDTBQ%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancelling-Transparency/dp/B0FH5QDTBQ/?th=1">the Px8 S2</a>. At $799, it’s $100 more expensive than its predecessor (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the Px8</a>) was at launch, which puts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px8-s2-headphones-have-updated-drivers-improved-anc-and-a-new-look-181913079.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">them</a> even further out of reach for most. Bowers &amp; Wilkins did change up its familiar design slightly, and there’s a big improvement to audio performance, the addition of high-res music over USB-C and improved call quality. There’s no doubt the Px8 S2 is beyond premium, but did the company go too far?</p>

<h2 id="84779a50-3768-4feb-a0f6-0877c35b9134">What’s new on the Px8 S2?</h2>
<p>After several generations of the Px7 and Px8 that had pretty much the same design, Bowers &amp; Wilkins changed things up a bit with the Px8 S2. There isn&#39;t a comprehensive redesign here, but the slimmer ear cup silhouette and the exposed cabling on the headband yokes are notable improvements to the overall look. Once again, the company opted for a mix of soft leather and die-cast aluminum, both of which give the Px8 S2 a decidedly high-end aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside, new 40mm carbon cone dynamic drivers were updated with a new chassis and motor. Those components are powered by 24-bit DSP (digital signal processing) with a dedicated amplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). There’s also a more robust five-band EQ with True Sound bypass, which allows you to disable any equalizer tweaks to quickly return to Bowers &amp; Wilkins’ stock tuning. The company added aptX Lossless support on top of the existing aptX Adaptive availability, and you can get “true” lossless — 24-bit/96kHz — sound quality over USB-C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the previous model, the Px8 S2 has two more microphones, bringing the total to eight. Six of those are used for external monitoring for ANC while two keep tabs on noise inside the headphones. All eight are used during calls, in addition to an upgraded “pure voice” algorithm to improve performance there. You can also hear yourself better in transparency mode, which is the biggest boost to calls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="a0966216-0eb7-41c2-a397-c7ba6d1dad72">What’s still good on the Px8 S2?</h2>

<p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins has excelled at crafting a warm, inviting and immersive sound profile across its headphones for a while now. That’s still the case on the Px8 S2 as the audio quality is rich and detailed, with a wide soundstage that envelops you — almost to the point of bombarding your ears. While I don’t think the bass tuning is well-suited for mellow genres, there’s plenty to like here. On albums like Jason Isbell’s <em>Foxes in the Snow, </em>for example, the amount of texture and subtle nuance where the only instruments are the singer’s voice and a single acoustic guitar is incredible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reliable battery life has been a strong point for the company in the past, and that remains true on the Px8 S2. The 30-hour battery figure (ANC on) is the same as the previous model, and I was able to easily achieve that longevity during my testing. With a mix of active noise cancellation, high-res tunes and transparency mode for work calls, the headphones easily kept up with Bowers &amp; Wilkins’ promised numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest knock against the Px8 S2 is the price. These headphones are way more expensive than what most companies charge for their top-of-the-line models, which is around $500 these days. Sure, $799 is only $50 more than the tariff-adjusted rate for the Px8 (which was originally $699), and there are several upgrades here, but that price will be prohibitively expensive for many, thus making the S2 harder to recommend despite their strengths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the upgraded sound, I feel like Bowers &amp; Wilkins may have gone too far with the bass tuning. There is some absolutely booming low-end tone on display here, especially for bass-heavy genres like rock, metal, EDM and hip-hop. On Spiritbox’s “Perfect Soul,” as one example, the kick drum edges dangerously close to drowning out the lead and bass guitars. A bit more restraint here would’ve provided ample thump and depth that isn’t almost exhausting to listen to. At times, the enhanced bass is great, but at others, like on Ruston Kelly’s <em>Pale, Through the Window, </em>it can really be too much for the style of music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On its recent headphones, Bowers &amp; Wilkins relocated the physical controls from sitting on the edge of their ear cups to a ridge on the outside. In the process, the company also made the buttons much smaller. As I said when I reviewed the Px7 S3, this makes the controls harder to find with your thumbs, and you also have to be more accurate with your presses. That’s especially true for the three-button array on the right side that handles volume changes and playback controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like it did with its previous headphone models, Bowers &amp; Wilkins hasn’t packed the Px8 S2’s spec sheet with advanced features. You do get a couple of basic items — multipoint Bluetooth and wear detection/automatic pausing — but things like speech recognition, hands-free assistants or automatic sound profiles aren’t here. This is an area where the likes of Sony, Bose and Sennheiser surpass Bowers &amp; Wilkins, even though products like the Px8 S2 typically offer superior sound quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So how well does Bowers &amp; Wilkins straddle that line between luxury and ludicrousness? I’d say <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FH5QDTBQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=66e1580b-7e40-41f0-9fa5-767a9b2fd6eb&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=the+Px8+S2&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Jvd2Vycy1XaWxraW5zLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1UcmFuc3BhcmVuY3kvZHAvQjBGSDVRRFRCUS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjZlMTU4MGItN2U0MC00MWYwLTlmYTUtNzY3YTliMmZkNmViIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Jvd2Vycy1XaWxraW5zLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1UcmFuc3BhcmVuY3kvZHAvQjBGSDVRRFRCUS8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXtDvOzPrBMHRf5B8zUJclcc_OJ6GX-FLHNV6L9kxiv6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancelling-Transparency%2Fdp%2FB0FH5QDTBQ%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancelling-Transparency/dp/B0FH5QDTBQ/?th=1">the Px8 S2</a> is a luxurious set of headphones with a ludicrous price. I fully understand that Bowers &amp; Wilkins is a high-end audio brand and that its products typically demand a premium over most of the competition. But like I already said, the price puts these excellent headphones out of reach. When you consider the price tag alongside the lack of advanced features, the Px8 S2 becomes hard to recommend. But for those who can afford them, a tantalizing symphony of sound awaits.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px8-s2-review-headphone-extravagance-193000794.html?src=rss
