According to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-back-in-development/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> report, a new game for the Alien franchise is back in development. The report&#39;s sources mentioned that the single-player game will be set in a &quot;decaying space station&quot; as an arcade survival horror that can be compared to &quot;Shadow of [the] Tomb Raider with Xenomorphs.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time we heard about this Alien game, which was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/">first reported</a> on in 2022 under the codename &quot;Marathon.&quot; According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, the game has cycled through several developers, but more recently landed with Eidos Montreal, which developed <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and is currently working on the upcoming <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-has-delayed-its-fable-reboot-until-2026-173118802.html"><em>Fable reboot</em></a>.
