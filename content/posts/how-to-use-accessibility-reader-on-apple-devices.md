<p>Earlier this year, Apple <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-brings-magnifier-to-macs-and-introduces-a-new-accessibility-reader-mode-120054992.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">launched a new tool</a> that makes it easier to read anything on your device’s screen. Designed for people with visual disabilities, Accessibility Reader provides a full-screen view of any on-screen text. (It’s a bit like Safari’s Reader Mode, only for any app.) The feature also lets you listen to your text read aloud.</p><p>Accessibility Reader is available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro. Your device will need to be on iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe or visionOS 26.</p><p>It’s a fairly straightforward experience. But since it offers several launch and customization options, here’s a quick breakdown on getting started and tweaking it to your liking.</p><h2 id="2bc2281c-53c0-474c-bbe7-954db4424604">How to turn on and open Accessibility Reader</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/accessibility_reader_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/accessibility_reader_2.jpg" style="height:536px;width:893px;" alt="The Accessibility Reader settings toggle on macOS." data-uuid="34486292-1af5-4c54-9f4e-33da157234f2"/><figcaption>The Accessibility Reader settings toggle on macOS.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Activating the feature is the same on any Apple device. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Read &amp; Speak</strong>, and turn on Accessibility Reader. (It’s at the very top.) Once you’ve done that, there are several ways to launch the tool.</p><h3 id="14a7e1c4-7989-4bb5-a9b9-8896aa4e1dc6">Accessibility Shortcut (iOS / iPadOS / visionOS)</h3><p><strong>Triple-click the lock button</strong>. That’s the side button on iPhone and the top button on iPad and Vision Pro. (On older iPads, triple-click the Home Button.) This brings up the Accessibility Shortcut, which includes a quick-launch item for Accessibility Reader.</p><p>If you don’t need the other items in this menu, you can remove them at <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Shortcut</strong>. Then, using the shortcut will immediately launch Accessibility Reader.</p><h3 id="de9a21cd-b214-4ee4-8655-bb6192ef9dde">Control Center (iOS / iPadOS)</h3><p>You can add a <strong>Control Center shortcut</strong> for the tool. Swipe down from the top-right to launch Control Center. Then, hold your finger on an empty part of the screen. Choose “Add a control” (bottom), and find the Accessibility Reader shortcut. You can now tap that Control Center icon whenever you want to launch it.</p><h3 id="2cdddd20-2e1a-4d6b-889c-3fdf9c3f2a4f">Keyboard Shortcut (macOS)</h3><p>The default Accessibility Reader shortcut on Mac is <strong>Cmd-Esc</strong>. Or, customize it in <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Reader</strong> by clicking the “i” next to the menu item.</p><h3 id="97ab629e-8d66-482f-81df-24f0c87f6472">Accessibility Shortcut (macOS)</h3><p>The tool is also available as part of the Mac’s Accessibility Shortcut. You can launch this menu using a keyboard shortcut (<strong>Opt-Cmd-F5</strong>), by quickly pressing Touch ID three times or with a Control Center shortcut. (However, the above Cmd-Esc shortcut should be the simplest for most people.)</p><h2 id="d7cc3550-742f-4bdc-8f93-0e842fe3436a">How to listen to text in Accessibility Reader</h2><p>The tool also includes a text-to-speech (TTS) option. Once you’ve launched Accessibility Reader, listening is as simple as pressing the play button (▶). You can then use the pause (⏸) shortcut to take a break.</p><p>Other options include skipping backward or forward using the rewind or fast-forward symbols. There’s also a speed adjustment, which you can change by choosing the 1x button.</p><p>If you want the Reader to speak text automatically when it opens, you can do that, too. That option is found under <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Reader</strong>. (On Mac, select the “i” symbol next to the menu entry to find this option.)</p><h2 id="c35e4f51-9db5-4d9a-8a51-95dee4034bbb">How to customize Accessibility Reader</h2><p>It’s easy to adjust the font size, color, theme and more. Once you’ve launched Accessibility Reader, tap the customization (AA) button. There, you can change the theme, colors, font, line spacing and much more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-use-accessibility-reader-on-apple-devices-212231319.html?src=rss
