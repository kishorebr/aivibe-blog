<p>First up, there&#39;s <em>Need For Speed Unbound</em>. This is a racing game that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/need-for-speed-unbound-release-date-trailer-174505124.html"><ins>came out at the tail-end of 2022</ins></a> and was the first entry in the franchise for several years before that. It has a unique visual style, thanks to cel-shaded graphics, with all kinds of vehicles to choose from. There are street racing challenges, weekly qualifiers and a minigame that has you outrunning the cops. The rapper A$AP Rocky also plays a prominent role in the narrative. It&#39;ll only available for PS5.</p>

<p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> is a recently-released remake of a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-29-disney-epic-mickey-review.html"><ins>2010 Wii game</ins></a>, but there&#39;s no Wiimote waggle here. This is just a great platformer with plenty of fan service for long-time Disney fans. Warren Spector, the lead designer of <em>Deus Ex</em>, was heavily involved in the making of this one. It&#39;ll be playable on both PS4 and PS5.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper</em> is a remarkable indie that has been floating around in early access for several years. The mining sim is now finished and offers an emphasis on crafting, base-building and, of course, exploration. While the game is playable solo, it&#39;s primarily intended as a multiplayer experience for up to eight people.</p>
<p>As the year ends, so does access to December&#39;s PS Plus Monthly titles. Subscribers have until January 5 to download <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, <em>Killing Floor 3</em>, <em>The Outlast Trials</em>, <em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> and <em>Neon White</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/januarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-need-for-speed-unbound-and-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-182335673.html?src=rss
