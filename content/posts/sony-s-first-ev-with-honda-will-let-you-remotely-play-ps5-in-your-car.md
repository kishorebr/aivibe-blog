<p>Faraway road trips just got a lot easier, at least for the passengers. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/">Sony Honda Mobility</a>, the joint venture between the two Japanese conglomerates created to produce electric vehicles, announced that its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobility-ces-2025-keynote-learn-more-about-the-afeela-1-ev-live-here-212536780.html">Afeela EV</a> will come with PS Remote Play.

Sony Honda Mobility said a 5Mbps broadband connection is required to play, and a 15Mbps rate will deliver a smoother experience.</p>
