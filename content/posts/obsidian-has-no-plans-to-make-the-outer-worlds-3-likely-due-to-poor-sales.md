<p>Developer Obsidian recently announced that it currently has no plans to make <em>The Outer Worlds 3</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?embedded-checkout=true"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. Company head Fergus Urquhart didn&#39;t give a reason as to why Obsidian won&#39;t be working on a sequel, but he did note that the performance of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> was &quot;disappointing&quot; and that it needs to &quot;think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them and how long they take.&quot;</p>
<p>Urquhart also said that <em>Avowed</em> was something of a miss for the company, but that it remains committed to the franchise. Obsidian plans to &quot;keep making games in the Avowed universe,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a legitimate sequel. <em>Avowed</em> is, after all, set in the same world as <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Obsidian is still working on DLC for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, so fans have that to look forward to. Urquhart also confirmed the company is making some DLC for <em>Grounded 2</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-talks-avowed-the-outer-worlds-grounded-2-performance-and-studio-future"><ins>which was actually a hit</ins></a>. It released three games last year, which Urquhart said was a bad move for support teams.</p>
<p>“Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out. It’s not good to release three games in the same year. It’s the result of things going wrong,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The developer is also making some entirely new games, of which we know nothing about. As for <em>Avowed</em>, it&#39;s coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/xbox-is-bringing-avowed-to-ps5-120000035.html"><ins>PS5 on February 17</ins></a>. All versions are getting an anniversary update that includes a New Game Plus mode, new races, new weapon types and more. It&#39;s a good game and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-review-elder-scrolls-i-dont-know-her-140057830.html"><ins>well worth the time</ins></a> of PlayStation fans, especially those who have dabbled with The Elder Scrolls franchise.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/obsidian-has-no-plans-to-make-the-outer-worlds-3-likely-due-to-poor-sales-192756351.html?src=rss
