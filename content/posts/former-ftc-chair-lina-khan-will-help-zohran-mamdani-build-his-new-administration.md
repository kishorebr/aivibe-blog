<p>A familiar face will be helping Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani set up his new administration before he takes office in 2026. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lina Khan</a>, former Federal Trade Commission Chair under President Joe Biden, has been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.transition2025.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">officially announced</a> as one of Mamdani&#39;s transition co-chairs, alongside Grace Bonilla, Maria Torres-Springer and Melanie Hartzog.</p><p>Mamdani&#39;s platform is focused on affordability, with fighting corporate corruption a key way he hopes to lower prices for New Yorkers. Mamdani&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pem255jxQEoWCN3Ic5ILZa2a9a4oDtqe/view" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">proposed policies</a> include working to ban hidden fees and non-compete clauses, while funding challenges to utility company rate hikes. It&#39;s not surprising that Khan and Mamdani would be aligned. As Chair, Khan is best known for trying to rebuild the FTC&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-accuses-amazon-of-monopolistic-practices-in-long-expected-antitrust-suit-165035712.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">anti-monopolist backbone</a>, but she was similarly interested in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-bans-employers-from-using-noncompete-clauses-123045777.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">banning non-compete clauses</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-bans-hidden-junk-fees-on-tickets-and-short-term-lodging-purchases-160702790.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">hidden junk fees</a>. Khan has also publicly expressed her appreciation for the Mamdani campaign&#39;s focus on small businesses in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/opinion/lina-khan-mamdani-democrats-small-business.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>The New York Times</em></a> Opinion section.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRZ3MKaRaFU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;I think what we saw last night was New Yorkers not just electing a new mayor, but clearly rejecting a politics where outsized corporate power and money too often end up dictating our politics,&quot; Khan said at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRZ3MKaRaFU" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">a press conference</a> announcing her new role. &quot;And a clear mandate for change, where New Yorkers can get ahead and where all workers and small businesses can thrive, not just get by.&quot;</p><p>While Mamdani has served as a New York state assemblyman, his <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/nyregion/mamdani-experience-mayor.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">relative lack of experience</a> has been used as a consistent criticism of his candidacy for mayor.

In the case of Khan, that includes a transition co-chair who’s willing to be openly critical of corporate power.
