<p><em>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</em> knew how to lay on the camp. But it wasn’t only known for having some of the most delightfully cheesy cutscenes this side of <em>The 7th Guest</em>. <em>Red Alert 2</em> was also an acclaimed real-time strategy game for its time, and it’s still perfectly playable today. Want to see for yourself? It’s now as easy as opening your browser.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chronodivide.com" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Chrono Divide</a> project (via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rts/im-escaping-to-the-one-place-that-hasnt-been-corrupted-by-capitalism-a-fanmade-browser-version-of-the-best-command-and-conquer/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>) lets you play the 2000 RTS in Chrome, Edge, or Safari. Although it supports Firefox, too, its developer says it should be avoided if you want “good performance.” It even works in mobile browsers.</p><p>Chrono Divide supports cross-platform multiplayer using all the original maps. (You can use some mods, too.) In fact, according to <em>PC Gamer</em>, multiplayer is about your only option. <em>Red Alert 2</em>’s single-player campaign modes (where you’ll encounter those “so bad, they’re good” cutscenes) are still a work in progress.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9kJnX3D0Ro?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser,” the project’s website reads. “Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla ‘Red Alert 2’ engine.”</p><p>You can take it for a spin on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chronodivide.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the Chrono Divide webpage</a>. You’ll need to import the original game files to begin. (The website automatically inserts a link to them on the Internet Archive.) But we won’t fault you if you’d rather opt for watching <em>Red Alert 2</em>’s fabulously corny cutscenes below.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eV6rWcABRxs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-play-command--conquer-red-alert-2-in-your-browser-213815557.html?src=rss
