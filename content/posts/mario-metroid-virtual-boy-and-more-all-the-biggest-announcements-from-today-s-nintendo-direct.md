<p>Whenever there&#39;s a Nintendo Direct in September, you can be pretty sure that it&#39;ll be a major edition of the showcase. Given that Friday&#39;s one was scheduled to be <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-hour-long-nintendo-direct-is-set-for-september-12-135935134.html">about an hour long</a> and that Nintendo has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">a whole new console to put games on</a>, it was already likely that there was going to be a lot of news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even then, it managed to be a jam-packed Direct. Let&#39;s take a look at all the biggest announcements from the showcase, including what&#39;s obviously the most important one: a Switch 2 version of <em>Overcooked 2</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-marios-40th-anniversary">Mario&#39;s 40th anniversary</h2>
<div id="d37dd8d6d4514138aa8a53e2cf810fe4"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>September 13 is the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>in Japan, which is a big reason why this Direct took place on a Friday (a highly unusual day for Nintendo to hold one of its showcases). Following news of Mario-related updates for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-museum-japan-095739941.html">Nintendo Museum in Kyoto</a>, the company revealed the title for the next Mario movie. It&#39;s called <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-be-marios-next-crack-at-the-big-screen-130840015.html"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, and it&#39;s coming to cinemas in the US on April 3. We&#39;ll have to wait a little longer for a trailer, though.</p>
<p>There was no announcement of an upcoming 3D Mario game today, unfortunately, but there was still plenty of other news. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html"><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a> is coming to Switch 2 in February as the first new Mario Tennis game since 2018. Yoshi&#39;s getting another adventure of his own with the Switch 2 platformer <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-is-a-new-platformer-coming-to-the-switch-2-next-spring-133805615.html"><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a>, which is set to arrive next spring. A Switch 2 version of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/super-mario-bros-wonder-is-getting-a-switch-2-version-with-new-multiplayer-modes-133722013.html"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> with fresh multiplayer modes will drop around that time too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before all of that, though, Nintendo is bringing the wonderful Wii games <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>and <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2 </em>to Switch on October 2. They&#39;ll be available separately or as a bundle on the eShop and as a combined edition on a $70 physical cartridge. On Switch 2, you&#39;ll be able to play these two classics in 4K.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures are coming in April as well. Even though I&#39;m not typically an Amiibo collector, I really want those because Luma is just adorable. In addition, Nintendo plans to release a physical collectible of the Talking Flower from <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>next spring.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-out-today">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC out today</h2>
<div id="9f523c306fc240409743362b566c83d5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44xycnG2mKo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>If you&#39;ve already smashed everything to smithereens in <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and have been yearning for more to do in one of the biggest Switch 2 exclusives to date, you&#39;re in luck. Nintendo revealed a paid expansion for the platformer during the Direct. It&#39;s called <em>DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush </em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-is-getting-a-dlc-expansion-today-140016430.html">it&#39;s out today for $20</a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll be able to barrel around Donkey Kong&#39;s home island and meet up with some familiar faces. After you&#39;ve beaten the story in the main game, you&#39;ll be able to try the Emerald Rush mode. This will see you undertaking timed runs in DK Island and the main game&#39;s layers to collect emerald ore, smash fossils and collect Banandium Gems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has released a demo for the main game. So, if you have a Switch 2 and haven&#39;t played <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>yet, you&#39;ll be able to find out for yourself why the other cool kids are saying &quot;ooh, banana!&quot; all the time.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<div id="373cbb46432946058ec90739f5d9fbe1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_bYri9p1Uk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Quite a few people were expecting/hoping for news of a new Animal Crossing during the Nintendo Direct. While that didn&#39;t happen, Nintendo had arguably something even more exciting to announce — especially if you&#39;re both an Animal Crossing and Pokémon fan.</p>
<p><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>is the first Pokémon life simulation game. You&#39;ll play as a Ditto who has been transformed to look like a human and turn empty land into a cozy paradise for both yourself and Pokémon. Ditto can learn abilities from Pokémon, such as using Squirtle’s Water Gun to give life to flora.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks utterly lovely. <em>Pokémon Pokopia </em>is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune&#39;s Weave</h2>
<div id="cd2c5746c28b4804b7ea6d7c5c9585a9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Nintendo used this Direct to seriously start filling out its Switch 2 slate for 2026. One of the games it&#39;s publishing for the system next year is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series. It announced <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-out-for-the-switch-2-in-2026-162127483.html"><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#39;s Weave</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>during the showcase.</p>
<p>As ever, this will be a turn-based tactical RPG. The debut trailer touched on the story and characters in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-metroid-prime-4-and-hades-2-release-dates">Metroid Prime 4 and Hades 2 release dates</h2>
<div id="6b683837dc614869b795cddb123b7d2f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJNCNswbdG0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>We had a feeling these were coming soon, but release dates for both <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> were both major announcements during the Direct. Samus has a rad, Tron-esque bike in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-will-be-released-on-december-4-for-switch-1-and-2-134718933.html">on December 4</a>.</p>
<p><em>Hades 2</em>, meanwhile, will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">on September 25</a>. The full game will be available on Steam and Epic Games Store on the same day as it will exit early access on PC. There were be cross-save support across PC and Switch/Switch 2. The Switch 2 version will support 120fps gameplay when the console is docked. That <em>Hades 2 </em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-should-give-you-a-chance-against-its-early-bosses-134125593.html"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>are dropping in the same month is pretty wild. Apologies to any designs you had on getting some sleep in September.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment release date</h2>
<div id="ed478ee232794ec0bdf060f8674988ec"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuSV9Sy28Mw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>

<p>Nintendo announced <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment </em>during a dedicated launch direct for Switch 2 back in April, and now there&#39;s a release date for this hack and slash game. It&#39;s coming to the console on November 6.</p>
<p><em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, which was developed by Koei Tecmo&#39;s AAA Games Studio, sees Princess Zelda traveling back in time and meeting Rauro and Sonia, the first king and queen of Hyrule. You&#39;ll try to take down Ganondorf (yes, again) in what&#39;s known as the Imprisoning War. Zonai devices will be at your disposal. According to the trailer, you&#39;ll &quot;uncover ancient truths that were only glimpsed in <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-familiar-but-fresh-adventure-120035307.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s two-player co-op support via split-screen and <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-lets-switch-2-players-share-their-games-132431186.html">GameShare</a>. Zelda, Rauru and Sonia are among the playable characters, and you&#39;ll be able to swap between them. You can also play as a Korok for a change instead of torturing the poor creatures, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpBBypN5Suw">you monsters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-aaa-third-party-games-coming-to-switch-2">AAA third-party games coming to Switch 2</h2>
<div id="3f29e72247eb4abf9f874e00ed98aefb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6a8gK0YdUpY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Nintendo confirmed during the Direct that <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> is coming to Switch 2. It&#39;ll arrive on February 27, the same day the next entry in Capcom&#39;s classic survival horror series debuts on other platforms. <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>will also land on Switch on on February 27.</p>
<p>We learned back in April that the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy was bound for Switch 2 and now there&#39;s a release date for that. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is coming to the system on January 22.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-switch-2-versions-of-indie-classics">Switch 2 versions of indie classics</h2>
<div id="c9949b91abb549369628f8616607cc23"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci9jNv_L3VE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Nintendo Switch was such an important platform for indie games, and several that became huge hits are getting Switch 2 versions. <em>Overcooked 2 </em>(the ultimate relationship test, in my opinion) will have support for 4K visuals, 60fps gameplay, GameShare and CameraPlay — the feature that allows you to see you and your teammate&#39;s faces on screen as you play —in its Switch 2 version. That&#39;s on the way this holiday season.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/stardew-valley-is-getting-yet-another-surprise-update-161805119.html"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> will also support GameShare for co-op play on Switch 2. Mouse controls will be available, as well as four-player splitscreen and eight-player online action. Those who have the game on Switch already will get a free upgrade when the Switch 2 version arrives this fall.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/soon-youll-be-able-to-fling-around-the-klutzy-schlub-in-human-fall-flat-on-vr-212033104.html"><em>Human Fall Flat</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is headed to Switch 2 in Spring 2026. That will also have support for mouse controls, GameShare and eight-person multiplayer.</p>
<p>It&#39;s far too early to say whether <em>Powerwash Simulator 2</em> will become an indie classic, but the original game was terrific and its sequel is getting a Switch 2 version as well. There&#39;s no exact release date for <em>Powerwash Simulator 2 </em>as yet, but it&#39;s still <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-will-arrive-later-this-year-164534571.html">slated to arrive this fall</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-suika-game-gets-a-sequel">Suika Game gets a sequel</h2>
<div id="422e2a0ce99340539d602a468fc0b6fc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51w_Eyf1vKM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p><em>Suika Game </em>was a huge hit, and the sequel promises to soak up even more of my time. <em>Suika Game Planet </em>adds an extra dimension to the puzzle action. Instead of dropping fruit into a bucket and trying to combine two of the same items into a larger one, this time there&#39;s a circular stage. That might be a fun wrinkle for anyone (me, hi) who gets frustrated about not being able to reach large fruit at the bottom of the container.</p>
<p><em>Suika Game Planet </em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 this winter and I might not be able to do anything else with my time after it drops. The Switch 2 version will support a GameShare mode that allows up to four players to work together.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-virtual-boy-is-back">Virtual Boy is back</h2>
<div id="40ee1b8fb62b469d85392b42fc5ed8d9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oc8qckEoKxk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Last but not least, Nintendo had an absolute shocker when it came to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. No, it&#39;s not adding <em>Super Mario Sunshine </em>to the Gamecube app just yet. The company is <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html">bringing Virtual Boy games to the service</a>, which is more bananas than anything you&#39;ll find in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To play those games from a system that was notoriously undercooked (partly because Nintendo was placing much more focus on the massively more successful Nintendo 64 around that time), you&#39;ll need an accessory. A $100 plastic tabletop one that looks just like the original Virtual Boy and a $25 cardboard version are on the way. They&#39;re compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2 and, if it&#39;s an authentic Virtual Boy experience, probably some eye strain.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-metroid-virtual-boy-and-more-all-the-biggest-announcements-from-todays-nintendo-direct-165722897.html?src=rss
