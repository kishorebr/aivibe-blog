<p>The Fairphone 6 is widely expected to get an official unveiling in the next week but the leadup to the repairable smartphone’s launch has been leakier than a bad tap. In a new report from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://winfuture.de/news,151633.html"><em><ins>WinFuture</ins></em></a>, purported images of the Fairphone 6 show that it’ll feature two back covers: one for the main body covering the cameras, and a lower panel that can be easily removed by loosening a few visible screws.</p>
<p>Doing so grants access to the battery, which <em>WinFuture</em> notes is not glued down, though swapping it out will require you to remove a few additional screws. The back plates are available in three different colors – black green and white – which you’re free to mix and match with to give the phone a more personalized look.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This being a Fairphone product, the battery unsurprisingly isn’t the only removable component. If you know what you’re doing, you can also replace the 50- and 13-megapixel main cameras and the 32–megapixel front-facing camera, as well as the display, speaker and USB-C charging port.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the Fairphone 6 is fairly unremarkable, but you’d expect it to be at the rumored €550 (around $630) price point it’ll reportedly retail at. As well as the aforementioned trio of lenses, it’ll reportedly have a 6.31-inch 120Hz display, 256GB of internal storage (expandable via a MicroSDXC slot), 8GB of RAM and a 4,415mAh battery. Under the hood is a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, so we’re firmly in mid-range territory. The Fairphone 6’s expected IP55 rating for water and dust resistance means it’ll comfortably withstand a bit of rain, but likely won’t take well to a dunk in the bath.</p>
<p>Of its predecessor, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-5-is-boring-how-exciting-094530738.html"><ins>Fairphone 5</ins></a>, released (though not in the US) in 2023, Engadget’s Daniel Cooper said: &quot;If you’re looking to pick up a mid-range handset that you can keep going for twice as long as any other phone on the market, and you want to do a bit of good in the process, this is probably the phone for you. It’s not often the view from the moral high ground is <em>this</em> comfortable.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-fairphone-6-leaks-ahead-of-its-rumored-late-june-launch-163630181.html?src=rss
