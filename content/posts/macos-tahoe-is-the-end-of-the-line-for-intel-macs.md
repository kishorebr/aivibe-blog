<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/apple/" data-autolinker-wiki-id="Apple_Inc." data-original-link="">Apple</a> announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html">a lot of new features</a> in today&#39;s WWDC stream, but news from one follow-up meeting heralds the end of an era. MacOS 26, also known as macOS Tahoe, will be the last version of the operating system to work on Macs powered by Intel Processors. Tahoe-supporting Intel Macs will get full access to all the new features, and they&#39;ll still get security updates for the next three years. By 2028, though they&#39;ll be out of the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first Apple Silicon processor <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">launched in 2020</a>. Since then, Apple has run all its hardware on its own <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html">Apple Silicon</a> microchips, which are <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mac-turns-40-how-apple-silicon-cured-its-midlife-crisis-161520642.html">significantly more powerful</a> than the Intel chips it had been using for most of the millennium. Apple Silicon&#39;s ARM-based architecture can perform more operations and use less battery power than the x86-based Intel processors. Many Intel-powered Macs have already aged out of updates, but today&#39;s update puts an expiration date on the last survivors.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement, which came during a Platform State of the Union (SOTU) following the main WWDC event, was aimed primarily at app developers. Apple is encouraging developers to plan for the post-Intel era and ensure the migration is as smooth as possible for themselves and their users. Both macOS 26 and the planned next version, macOS 27, will include the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rosetta-2-will-keep-old-intel-apps-running-on-apples-new-silicon-182442712.html">Rosetta translation process</a>, which helps apps built for x86 run on ARM. After 27, Rosetta  will remain in place to support legacy video games.</p>
<p>Intel-powered Macs that will support Tahoe include the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 2020 27-inch iMac and the 2019 Mac Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-is-the-end-of-the-line-for-intel-macs-113036626.html?src=rss
