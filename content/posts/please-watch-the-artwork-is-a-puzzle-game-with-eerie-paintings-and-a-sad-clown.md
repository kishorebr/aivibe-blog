<p>Fusing light psychological horror with the quiet melancholy of American Realist painter Edward Hopper, developer Thomas Waterzooi is following up his puzzle games <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html#:~:text=Thomas%20Waterzooi-,Please%2C%20Touch%20The%20Artwork,-Available%20for%3A%20PC"><em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Please, Touch the Artwork 2 </em>by having you just watch the artwork instead. <em>Please, Watch the Artwork</em> is an upcoming spot-the-difference game featured during <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-day-of-the-devs-at-summer-game-fest-2025-150047219.html">Day of the Devs</a> that tasks you with observing a museum of living paintings and tracking down a sad clown that may be harshing the other paintings' vibe.</p>
<p>In the game, you'll observe living versions of classic Edward Hopper paintings, like <em>Nighthawks</em> or <em>Automat</em>, and look for inconsistencies, like a character behaving strangely or objects being out of place â€” what one could describe as sad clown interference. You'll then click on the offending area and it'll be repainted, restoring the living painting to its normal gloomy self.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please, Watch the Artwork</em> riffs on popular horror titles like <em>I'm On Observation Duty, </em><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-19-all-of-the-nightmares-live-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html"><em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em></a> and dozens of other similar games on Steam that make you look at fake CCTV footage of a garages and office buildings. Waterzooi's game just takes a slightly classier approach. The combination of classic art and eclectic puzzle mechanics has paid off well in the past, too: <em>Please, Touch the Artwork </em>was nominated for numerous awards, including an Apple Design Award.</p>
<p><em>Please, Watch the Artwork</em> will be available on iOS and Android for $4.99 and on Steam for macOS, Windows and Linux devices for $7.99. Waterzooi's Day of the Dev's presentation didn't include an exact release date for the game, but he did suggest that it will be out around Halloween.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/please-watch-the-artwork-is-a-puzzle-game-with-eerie-paintings-and-a-sad-clown-000022744.html?src=rss
