    Can a newbie really vibe code an app? I tried Cursor and Replit to find out
     
    I'm not a programmer, but I tried four vibe coding tools to see if I could build anything at all on my own. Here's what I did and did not accomplish.

Startups such as Cursor, Replit, Lovable Labs, Harness, Windsurf, Augment Code, All Hands AI, and Microsoft, with its Visual Studio with GitHub Co-pilot, all offer programs that can drastically reduce the hand-coding humans need to do.  And so I wondered: Could a newbie like me, with limited programming knowledge, talk my way through creating an app?  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that vibe coding English is going to be the new programming language. Armed with that blessing, I set out to try.  Also: Why AI coding tools like Cursor and Replit are doomed - and what comes nextI had a blast watching how Cursor and the others can automatically perform tasks such as setting up the "virtual environment," finding and installing code libraries, installing and running a local server, and making constant tweaks. The fact that an app can do all that with a simple natural-language prompt from the user is a wonder to behold.   After several days of experimentation with multiple tools, I managed to get a small, simple data analysis program running. It was a promising start, b
