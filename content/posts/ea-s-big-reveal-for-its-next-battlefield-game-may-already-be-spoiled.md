<p>Looks like we can skip the drum roll for the next <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eas-next-battlefield-game-may-be-in-trouble-and-over-budget-130046636.html">Battlefield title</a> reveal. Seen in a<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946378128084910397"> leak</a> of Electronic Arts&#39; upcoming first-person shooter, the company is shipping promotional materials to content creators for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. The name drop may not be all that surprising, but the highly anticipated title could be a turning point for EA that follows up on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-in-game-voice-chat-weapon-attachments-172527991.html"><em>Battlefield 2042</em></a>, which was released in 2021 and currently sits at a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/">Mixed review rating</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>In the since-deleted post, gaming YouTuber DooM49 revealed a promotional crate labeled <em>Battlefield 6</em> that was reportedly sent to him by EA. The mysterious package was secured by straps that could hint at potential game modes, with words like &quot;conquest,&quot; &quot;breakthrough&quot; and &quot;rush&quot; wrapped around the box. Another Battlefield content creator, rivaLxfactor, shared more details about the rumored EA event, corroborating the info from DooM49. As seen in the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946401115240644819">post on X</a>, EA will reportedly hold a three-day event to reveal <em>Battlefield 6</em>, starting on July 29. The event will also reportedly feature interviews with the game&#39;s developers and show off some content with invited guests. The leaks also point to EA potentially launching the open beta for <em>Battlefield 6</em> after the event.</p>
