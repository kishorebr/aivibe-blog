<p>The second season of Prime Video&#39;s <em>Fallout</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-renews-fallout-months-before-season-2s-premiere-143028657.html">is coming this December</a> and the marketing machine <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-ifallouti-ups-the-ante-season-two-jou">is just starting to ramp up</a>. The streamer has released some light plot details and, more importantly, several cool images. Two of these photos reference the franchise&#39;s iconic New Vegas location, which was teased at the end of the first season.</p>
<p>Prime Video says that season two will take &quot;audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas.&quot; However, we still don&#39;t know if the show&#39;s depiction will be franchise accurate. The released images show Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins) touring the actual Las Vegas in the before times, long before becoming the Ghoul.</p>

<p>However, one picture does show the Lucky 38 casino, which is extremely important to fans of the games. The remaining images catch up with other major players from season one. There&#39;s one of Lucy (Ella Purnell) butting heads with the Ghoul and another showing Maximus (Aaron Moten) back with the Brotherhood of Steel after the events of the season finale.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a trailer yet, but that should be coming soon. December is just a few months away. The <em>Fallout </em>TV show <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-fallout-tv-series-is-a-very-awesome-tv-show-130039789.html">has proven to be a huge hit</a>, both with fans and critics. Prime Video has already renewed it for a third season.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/first-images-from-fallout-season-2-tease-new-vegas-182528357.html?src=rss
