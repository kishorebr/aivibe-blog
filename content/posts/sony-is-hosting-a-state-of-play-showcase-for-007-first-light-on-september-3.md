<p>Sony has lined up its next PlayStation State of Play showcase, and this one is all about a single game. It will focus on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-james-bond-game-007-first-light-is-coming-in-2026-215517819.html"><em><ins>007 First Light</ins></em></a>, the long-awaited James Bond adventure from Hitman studio IO Interactive. It starts at 2PM ET on September 3 and you can watch it on the PlayStation <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwRpK8eoLLE"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> channels (there&#39;ll also be a version of the video with English subtitles on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3S4qXOarxM"><ins>YouTube</ins></a>). You can also just hit the play button on the YouTube video above when the time is right.</p>
<p>The showcase will run for over 30 minutes and it will feature a deep dive into gameplay, including a full playthrough of a young Bond&#39;s first mission. Over on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/"><em><ins>PlayStation Blog</ins></em></a>, IOI said to expect &quot;everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts.&quot; Following that, IOI will offer up more details on <em>007 First Light </em>gameplay. Perhaps we&#39;ll also get a release date or narrower window for the action-adventure game, which is slated to hit Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2026.</p>

It&#39;s also available on PC and consoles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-is-hosting-a-state-of-play-showcase-for-007-first-light-on-september-3-151958435.html?src=rss
