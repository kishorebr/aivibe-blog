<p>The end of any sports season is usually the most exciting part, and MLS fans can watch the climax of the 2025 campaign for a discount. As it has done each year around this time since it <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-mls-soccer-streaming-subscription-service-171000757.html"><ins>locked up the rights</ins></a> to the top North American soccer league, Apple is offering the MLS Season Pass at a discount for the remainder of the season. Apple TV+ subscribers can get access for $25, while everyone else can snag the season pass for $29.</p> 
<p>This is just the latest MLS Season Pass price cut of 2025, as <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-tvs-mls-season-pass-is-half-off-for-the-rest-of-the-season-144305030.html"><ins>Apple slashed it in half to $49 in July</ins></a>.

<p>We're now well over halfway through the 2025 season. Teams have between five and nine games of the regular season left to play. Inter Miami have the most games remaining due to the team's participation in the Club World Cup, so Lionel Messi fans might get to see quite a bit more of him — especially if his squad makes the MLS Cup playoffs. You'll also have the chance to check out a few new high-profile imports to MLS, including Son Heung-min at Los Angeles FC and Thomas Müller at Vancouver Whitecaps. The season will end with the MLS Cup final, which will <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/major-league-soccer-announces-audi-2025-mls-cup-playoffs-schedule">take place on December 6</a>.</p>
