<p>Creators building experiences in <em>Fortnite</em> are getting a new way to earn revenue. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Epic says</a> developers will soon have the ability to make and sell in-game items in <em>Fortnite</em>, and earn a cut of the V-Bucks users spend to buy them. Previously, developers <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-will-share-40-percent-of-fortnite-purchase-revenue-with-creators-192924916.html">only earned money</a> through Fortnite based on the amount of time users spent on their &quot;islands,&quot; the in-game name for third-party experiences creators can offer through <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to create their consumable and durable in-game items using soon-to-be-released tools in Unreal Editor for Fortnite and a new &quot;Verse-based API,&quot; according to Epic. The company also plans to be generous with the revenue split its offering, at least at first. Developers&nbsp;&quot;will ordinarily earn 50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,&quot; but from December 2025 through the end of 2026, they&#39;ll get to keep 100 percent.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Epic says its 50 percent cut — notably more than the 30 percent popularized by Apple&#39;s App Store — is to help &quot;contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses&quot; of running <em>Fortnite</em>. It&#39;s also a make-good of sorts, since Epic claims it&#39;s been &quot;investing and operating the business at a loss.&quot;</p>
<p>How much 100 percent or 50 percent of &quot;V-Bucks value&quot; actually equals in real money unfortunately isn&#39;t as simple as converting Fortnite&#39;s digital currency to dollars, though. Epic offers the following explanation for how it calculates V-Bucks value:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite&#39;s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alongside the new ability to create in-game items, Epic says Fortnite developers will be able to pay to be featured in a new &quot;Sponsored row&quot; inside <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s Discover feed. And to better engage new and returning players, developers are also getting access to new tools for creating community forums and sharing updates on their islands.</p>
<p>All of these changes are in service of&nbsp;further extending <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s ability to act as a platform for games and social experiences, rather than just a battle royale game (with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-shows-off-more-of-fortnites-rocket-racing-mode-ahead-of-its-launch-023944541.html">racing</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-festival-tries-to-bring-back-the-heyday-of-music-gaming-153624729.html">rhythm game</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-aims-at-the-survival-builder-crown-with-its-new-lego-mode-151433897.html">LEGO spin-offs</a>). Epic clearly wants <em>Fortnite</em> to be Roblox, and reap the benefits of having an active community of adult and child users creating experiences for its platform. Cultivating that audience has led to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-15/roblox-faces-lawsuits-over-child-safety">all sorts of child safety problems</a> for Roblox,<em>&nbsp;</em>but Epic clearly views the risks to be worth it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/epic-will-let-fortnite-creators-sell-in-game-items-in-latest-attempt-to-compete-with-roblox-192059073.html?src=rss
