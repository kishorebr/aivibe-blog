<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been an incredibly versatile game developer over the years, even venturing outside its RPG comfort zone with the original <em>Grounded</em>. As a survival adventure game where you&#39;re shrunken down and explore the hidden, vast world of a backyard, it became a well-loved hit, and it evolved even further throughout its early access period. But now, the developers have big plans for <em>Grounded 2</em>, which has new features and a larger scope that was too big for the original to contain.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reveal during the recent Xbox Games Showcase alongside Summer Game Fest 2025, I got to play the opening of the sequel, which sees the familiar crew of teenage scavengers, now a little older and wiser, shrunken down once again to survive a new small world hidden in the town&#39;s park. Even as a new iteration of a familiar premise, which is essentially the survival gameplay of <em>Rust</em> by way of the whimsical <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em>, <em>Grounded 2</em> is already showing some promise as the bigger and better sequel.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5b0078270e864d8ca1a76b1b3d035976"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Grounded 2</em>, which will also launch in early access, already feels like a bigger game, even from the confines of the tutorial zone. For starters, there&#39;s a larger focus on building up the experience of the four teenage scavengers and how they fit into the larger story. It&#39;s not quite <em>Yellowjackets </em>when it comes to teen drama, but the crew exploring the small world of the park have colorful language and quips at their disposal. There&#39;s a generally stronger sense of personality in <em>Grounded 2</em>, which is bolstered by some more character-driven writing and opportunities to take in the lore of the company responsible for the experiments in town.</p>
<p>The experience of playing<em> Grounded 2</em>, much like the original and other survival games, is all about gathering resources from the land and acquiring knowledge to stay alive. Along with collecting materials to build weapons, armor and structures, you&#39;ll also have to keep your characters fed and hydrated. You&#39;ll also need to defend yourself against the various critters roaming about, such as the ants and the spiders. Also returning is the arachnophobia accessibility option to make them appear less disturbing for players. Thankfully, you can now use a dodge to avoid attacks – a first for the series – and combat is generally more responsive and fair.</p>
<p><em>Grounded 2</em> feels like a more well-rounded and refined take on the original, which is a solid game in its own right. One great addition that I got to play with was the new ant mount, or buggy, as the devs call it. You&#39;ll be able to ride on top of a friendly ant that can attack enemies, move faster throughout the world, and even collect material far more quickly than the human scavengers.</p>

<p>Shortly after my hands-on experience, I sat in on a roundtable discussion with game director Chris Parker and producer Miles Winzeler from Obsidian Entertainment, who explained how early access feedback from players helped bring the game to its current state. In order to fully implement their vision for Grounded, though, they would need a new game.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost everything in <em>Grounded 2</em> comes from feedback from the community that we had gathered from the first game,&quot; Parker said. &quot;We had to look at what was important to work on with the sequel. People always want more stuff to do. They wanted to have the buggies, which was a huge one and our number one most requested feature from out the gate on <em>Grounded 1</em>. We then had to work on new creatures, armor and weapons, among other things. How can we further develop our progression systems? So those were all the things that we took on from the beginning for <em>Grounded 2</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Grounded 2</em> felt like a more fully realized game, which leveraged years of work on the original. Along with a more developed story campaign focusing on helping the kids survive the portion of Brookhollow Park they have to explore – which is more than three times the size of the original&#39;s map – The game will also launch with creative mode, which was a popular feature that let players focus on exploring and building up structures at their leisure.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re always trying to challenge scale and how we can create a sense of awe and mystery by having something that&#39;s supposed to be normal but is now this gigantic thing,&quot; Parker said. &quot;That&#39;s always the fun when making this game.&quot;</p>
<p>I really took to the added scope of <em>Grounded 2</em>. Not just as a shrunken person trapped on the grounds of a park but also for the new features and ideas at work for the sequel. With the game coming out in July for early access, <em>Grounded 2</em> has already got me invested in making a return visit to this small world with big ambitions.</p>
<p><em>Grounded 2</em> will release in early access on July 29 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and will be available for Game Pass subscribers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/obsidian-entertainment-has-big-ambitions-for-grounded-2s-small-world-173027415.html?src=rss
