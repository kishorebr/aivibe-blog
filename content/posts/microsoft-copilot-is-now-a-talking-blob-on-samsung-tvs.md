<p>Copilot, Microsoft&#39;s AI assistant that&#39;s integrated into Windows and Microsoft 365, is making the jump to your living room.

<p>Based on Microsoft&#39;s examples, Copilot can recap shows, offer movie suggestions and answer general knowledge questions. It can also go beyond voiced responses (which are apparently synced to the blob&#39;s animated mouth movements) and include visual aids, like a card with a movie summary and a Rotten Tomatoes score. You don&#39;t need to have a Microsoft account to use Copilot on your TV, but Microsoft says it offers additional personalizations and the ability for the AI to reference past chats if you do.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Copilot&#39;s blob-ified appearance is part of a bigger redesign <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-redesigns-copilot-for-the-web-and-mobile-173036164.html"><ins>Microsoft introduced in 2024</ins></a> that made the chatbot interface more personalized and user-friendly. Besides being a productivity tool, Microsoft is interested in positioning Copilot as a &quot;companion&quot; with a visual representation that you can customize. The larger customization part isn&#39;t available yet, but putting Copilot in a casual setting like your living room fits with that overall goal. Copilot integration was also announced as being a part of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lgs-oled-evo-tvs-for-2025-come-with-ai-and-a-165hz-refresh-rate-200037568.html"><ins>LG&#39;s 2025 TV lineup</ins></a>.

<p>Copilot is available in select markets on the 2025 versions of Samsung&#39;s &quot;Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro, The Frame, as well as the M7, M8 and M9 Smart Monitors,&quot; Microsoft says. You can launch Copilot by clicking on its icon in the Apps Tab or using a voice command. Once the app is loaded, you can talk to the assistant by pressing the mic button on your Samsung remote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-copilot-is-now-a-talking-blob-on-samsung-tvs-204115199.html?src=rss
