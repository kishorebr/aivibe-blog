<p>Gather ‘round, it’s time to catch up on the latest batch of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Engadget reviews</a>. Whether you missed our in-depth testing of Sony’s latest flagship earbuds or a truly unique ASUS laptop, I’ve compiled our recent reviews so you can get up to speed quickly. Read on for the list that also includes a love letter to a tiny camera and another VPN option that worth considering. </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-sony-wf-1000xm6">Sony WF-1000XM6</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="e7826f05-a2c7-4d3d-abe1-e5fb4d03497e" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G6J3SV7P"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Sony’s 1000X earbuds have always been the top pick in our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best wireless earbuds</a> guide. With <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the M6</a> though, the company doesn’t do enough to clearly separate itself from the competition like it has in the past. “The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide,” I wrote. </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-duo-2026">ASUS Zenbook Duo (2026)</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="21d701f2-db44-4780-ba6e-ddf385c810fd" data-original-url="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-duo-ux8407/"></core-commerce></p>
<p>If you’re looking for something unique in your next laptop, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-duo-2026-review-two-screens-really-are-better-than-one-140000982.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">ASUS Zenbook Duo</a> is worth considering. Dual screens? Yep. Detachable keyboard? Sure. Good battery life? It does that too. “I&#39;m a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones,” senior reporter Sam Rutherford explained. “However, even if you&#39;re not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered.” </p>
<h2 id="jump-link-kodak-charmera">Kodak Charmera</h2>

<p>A tiny $30 camera was too cute for our editors to resist. Despite the subpar images it captures, they’re still smitten with the thing. “I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised by how much I&#39;m enjoying <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-ridiculously-tiny-kodak-charmera-captured-our-hearts-and-lots-of-shoddy-pictures-140000245.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the Charmera</a> experience,” weekend editor Its crunchy photos are just good enough to feel like they&#39;re successfully preserving a moment in time. And being so tiny, it&#39;s really convenient to bring everywhere.”</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-mullvad-vpn">Mullvad VPN</h2>
<p>Senior writer Sam Champman’s latest VPN review is Mullvad, which he says is often regarded as one of the best in terms of overall privacy. “It&#39;s not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well,” he noted. “Of course, it has its own compromises. It&#39;s solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user&#39;s options for troubleshooting.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-sony-wf-1000xm6-asus-zenbook-duo-and-more-130000298.html?src=rss
