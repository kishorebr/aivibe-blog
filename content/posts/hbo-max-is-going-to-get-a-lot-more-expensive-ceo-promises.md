<p>David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, plans to make HBO more expensive, and passwords a lot harder to share, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/david-zaslav-tv-terrible-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236367283/"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter</ins></em></a>. Zaslav shared his general outlook on the state of television at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, with the main theme being that HBO Max&#39;s content is good and Zaslav thinks he should be charging a lot more for it.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that this is quality — and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality — we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,&quot; Zaslav said. &quot;We think we’re way underpriced.&quot; HBO Max most recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/max-just-raised-subscription-prices-again-160849334.html"><ins>raised prices in 2024</ins></a>, back when it was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/max-which-was-once-hbo-reverts-to-hbo-max-154149241.html"><ins>temporarily called Max</ins></a>. As of right now you can get an entry-level Basic with Ads plan for $9.99 per month, while the ad-free Premium plan costs $20.99 per month. Zaslav clearly thinks he can get more, though.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Warner Bros. Discovery has been more open about its plans to address password-sharing. During an earnings call in August, the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-plans-aggressive-crack-down-on-password-sharing-starting-next-month-164357329.html"><ins>company said</ins></a> it wanted to close all loopholes for sharing passwords by the end of the year. While it&#39;s great that people continue to be drawn to HBO content, &quot;it’s all tricky with the password sharing,&quot; Zaslav said. &quot;We’re going to begin to push on that.&quot;</p>
<p>Price hikes and password sharing crackdowns have been thoroughly <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-password-sharing-crackdown-seems-to-be-working-151023478.html"><ins>normalized by Netflix</ins></a> and other streamers. HBO Max following suit should be more than expected. Stating those plans so plainly doesn&#39;t improve the image of Zaslav as <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.latimes.com/la-influential/story/2024-06-30/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery"><ins>a Hollywood villain</ins></a>, but that&#39;s the least of his worries given the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-will-split-into-two-media-giants-144553585.html"><ins>planned break-up</ins></a> of Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-going-to-get-a-lot-more-expensive-ceo-promises-221656560.html?src=rss
