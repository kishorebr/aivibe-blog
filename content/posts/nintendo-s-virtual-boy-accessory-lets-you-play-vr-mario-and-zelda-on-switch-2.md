<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-virtual-boy-is-a-tribute-to-nintendos-wackiest-console-140000003.html">forthcoming Nintendo Virtual Boy accessory</a> for Switch and Switch 2 can play VR-supported games, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/">as reported by <em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>. There are four available games to play, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>
<p>These aren&#39;t new VR builds of the games, rather they are the versions previously released for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html">Nintendo Labo</a> VR set. This was a kit for the original Switch that allowed users to build a cardboard VR headset, among other items.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cb0a072feed84ecc954d160d9d366b4f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5VI-fpVqhA?si=XP_1FNIfQkC9S2ko" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>However, this is very good news for Switch 2 owners as Labo creations generally don&#39;t work with Nintendo&#39;s shiny new console. So this is the only way to experience the VR versions of the aforementioned four games. It&#39;s also worth noting that the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> still includes the VR mode.</p>
<p>There are some caveats. The Virtual Boy accessory is available to purchase as a hardware unit or in cardboard. The cardboard version is much cheaper, at $25, and is actually the preferred method for playing these games in VR.</p>
<p>That&#39;s because the hardware version sits on a stand, like the original Virtual Boy, making it harder to move one&#39;s head around. The cardboard headset is free from those constraints. The hardware also includes red filters over the lenses, to better mimic the original experience, but these can be removed.</p>
<p>However, the hardware version is better for playing actual Virtual Boy games, as they were designed for a static headset resting on a table. You&#39;ll have to decide if that trade-off is worth $100. It&#39;s also worth noting that Virtual Boy games <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online">will not work with the original Labo VR headset</a>, which is a bummer for OG Switch fans.</p>

<p>Both versions of the Virtual Boy accessories <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html">will be available on February 17</a>, which is the same day several of the retro console&#39;s games head to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. They can be <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829">purchased at the My Nintendo Store</a>. We got a chance to try the headset and came away fairly impressed, though noted that the revamped accessory is &quot;just as eccentric and ungainly as the original was three decades ago.&quot;</p>
<p>For those wondering what all the fuss is about, the Virtual Boy was an actual console released by Nintendo all the way back in 1995. It was one of the first mass-market VR devices and, as such, was decades ahead of the curve. It was cumbersome, the games were only in red and there was nothing by way of motion control. Americans only got 14 games before the console was discontinued.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-virtual-boy-accessory-lets-you-play-vr-mario-and-zelda-on-switch-2-172138483.html?src=rss
