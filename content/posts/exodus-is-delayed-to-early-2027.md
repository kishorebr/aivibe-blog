<p>So there&#39;s good news and bad news about the highly anticipated <em>Exodus</em> coming out of The Game Awards this year. The good news is that there&#39;s a fresh trailer showcasing more of the game. The bad news is that the game won&#39;t be out until early 2027. The game was originally announced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/exodus-is-a-new-sci-fi-rpg-from-former-bioware-343-and-naughty-dog-developers-011433508.html">two years ago</a> (also at The Game Awards) and had been pegged for release in 2026.</p>
<p>We may be waiting longer to get our hands on <em>Exodus</em>, but the substantial new trailer shows more of what the final product will entail, offering some backstory on main character Jun Aslan. He&#39;s the only human who can use the technology developed by Celestials, which are humans that have evolved 40,000 years into the future. The trailer also showcases the character C.C. Orlev, voiced by Matthew McConaughey. (Insert obligatory &quot;alright alright alright&quot; here.) Developer Archetype Entertainment includes some notable names from BioWare, 343 Industries and Naughty Dog, and the BioWare lineage seems particularly strong with this character- and choice-driven science fiction story.</p>
