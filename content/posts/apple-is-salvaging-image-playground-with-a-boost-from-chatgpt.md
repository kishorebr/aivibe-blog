When Apple unveiled Image Playground last year, the company touted it as a quick and easy way to generate personalized, original images with the help of Apple Intelligence. Upon launch, the app was met with skepticism, as some users were disappointed by its limitations and low-quality results.

For example, one Reddit user was surprised to find that Image Playground kept generating an image of a hand with six fingers when prompted to create an “up close image of a hand.” In another instance, a user was unable to receive images of simple descriptions, such as “old man” or “flower.” 


	
	




	
	



Some people even questioned what the point of the app was, noting that it seemed juvenile when compared to popular AI image generators. (Of course, not everybody dislikes the app; some have described it as being a fun experience.)

Fast-forward to this year’s WWDC, where the tech giant announced that it’s going to boost Image Playground with a ChatGPT integration, which should allow for a better, more advanced AI image generation service.

With the new ChatGPT integration, users will be able to access more styles that move beyond the emoji-like creations that Image Playground has become known for. 

Images can be created in the following new styles: Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print. In addition, people will be able to select a new “Any Style” option that allows them to describe exactly what they want. These new styles will be visible under a banner that reads “ChatGPT style.”

In the past, users were limited to Animation, Illustration, Sketch, and Genmoji styles.
