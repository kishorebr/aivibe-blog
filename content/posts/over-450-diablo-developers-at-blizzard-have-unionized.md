<p>More than 450 Diablo developers at Blizzard Entertainment <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america"><ins>have voted</ins></a> to unionize with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The union will represent employees across multiple disciplines including designers, engineers, artists and support staff. This comes after a slew of layoffs in the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html"><ins>gaming division at Microsoft</ins></a>, Blizzard&#39;s parent company, as well as across <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html"><ins>the industry</ins></a> at large.</p>
<p>The Diablo team isn&#39;t the first to unionize at the tech giant. <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/zenimax-qa-workers-win-tentative-union-contract-with-microsoft-194204789.html"><ins>ZeniMax QA</ins></a> workers reached a union contract with Microsoft after two years of negotiations, and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-team-has-voted-to-unionize-213818158.html"><ins>Blizzard&#39;s</ins></a> Story and Franchise Development team voted to unionize earlier this month. Both are part of the CWA, which also helped the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-developers-behind-overwatch-have-unionized-154021756.html"><ins>developers behind </ins><em><ins>Overwatch</ins></em></a> unionize earlier this summer.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kelly Yeo, a Diablo game producer and organizing committee member, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america"><ins>said</ins></a> that the mass layoffs at Microsoft were a major motivating factor in the unionization. &quot;With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I&#39;ve witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us,&quot; she said. &quot;This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear.&quot;</p>
<p>CWA says that more than 3,500 Microsoft workers have organized with the union. Earlier this year, video game workers announced the formation of the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/video-game-workers-in-north-america-now-have-an-industry-wide-union-130024730.html"><ins>United Videogame Workers-CWA</ins></a>, an industry-wide union for workers in the US and Canada.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/over-450-diablo-developers-at-blizzard-have-unionized-180544383.html?src=rss
