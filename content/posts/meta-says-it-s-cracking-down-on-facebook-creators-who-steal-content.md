<p>Meta is going after creators who rip off other users' content as part of a broader effort to fix Facebook's feed. In its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://creators.facebook.com/blog/combating-unoriginal-content">latest update</a>, the company laid out new steps it's taking to penalize accounts that lift work from others.</p>
<p>In a blog post for creators, Meta says that accounts that "repeatedly" and "improperly" reuse other accounts' text posts, photos or videos will have their pages demonetized "for a period of time." Meta willa also throttle all of their posts, not just the ones with the offending content. The company notes that the change is meant to target "repeated reposting of content from other creators without permission or meaningful enhancements" and not content like reaction videos.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta has previously taken similar steps to reward original content <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagrams-algorithm-overhaul-will-reward-original-content-and-penalize-aggregators-130018977.html"><ins>on Instagram</ins></a>, where the company has actively replaced reposted Reels with the original clip. The company now says it's looking into a similar move on Facebook by adding a link to the original video when it detects a duplicate.</p>

<p>The latest crackdown comes as Meta says it's trying <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-finally-acknowledges-that-facebook-has-a-major-spam-problem-175304372.html">to reduce</a> the amount of spammy and other undesirable posts in Facebook's feed. Earlier this year, the company said it would demonetize creators who share posts with spammy captions and go after creators that manipulate engagement on the platform. In its newest update, Meta shared that since the start of the year it penalized more than 500,000 accounts that engaged in such tactics, "applying measures ranging from demoting their comments and reducing the distribution of their content to preventing these accounts from monetizing." The company has also removed more than 10 million profiles it says impersonated "large content producers."</p>
<p>Additionally, Meta is rolling out new in-app insights it says can help realtors understand issues affecting their reach or monetization status. The new dashboard will highlight potential problems, like unoriginal content or spammy captions, as well as issues affecting monetization.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-cracking-down-on-facebook-creators-who-steal-content-203713569.html?src=rss
