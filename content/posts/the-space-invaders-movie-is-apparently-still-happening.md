<p>It&#39;s been a few years since we last heard anything about <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-13-space-invaders-movie-in-production.html"><ins>the Space Invaders movie</ins></a> that is reportedly in the works, but a new report suggests things are inching forward again. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/space-invaders-movie-new-line-ben-zazove-evan-turner-1236482473/"><em><ins>Deadline</ins></em></a>, Ben Zazove and Evan Turner (<em>The Out-Laws</em>) are now on board to write the movie for Warner Bros.&#39; New Line Cinema.</p>
<p>A movie adaptation of Taito&#39;s classic arcade game has been brewing for over a decade now, after <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-19-take-me-to-your-theater-space-invaders-movie-in-works.html"><ins>Warner Bros. bought the rights</ins></a> to spin it into a film back in 2014. It was reported in 2019 that screenwriter Gregg Russo (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> 2021) had been tapped to write the script, but it seems some changes have been made in the years since. There&#39;s no word yet on a release date or how it&#39;ll approach the alien invasion story. Video game adaptations have been having a bit of a moment lately, though, so they may be looking to ride that momentum and actually bring this one to life now. Time will tell.</p>
