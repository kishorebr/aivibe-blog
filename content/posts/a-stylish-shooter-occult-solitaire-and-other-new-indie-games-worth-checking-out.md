<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of indie game news and releases. We&#39;ve got some nifty stuff lined up for you this time around, including a stylish co-op shooter and a very cool Metroidvania concept. But first I&#39;d like to bring your attention to a newish game I picked up in the Steam Summer Sale. It is absolutely breaking my brain — or perhaps it might actually improve my cognitive function.</p>
<p>It&#39;s called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3445580/Ambidextro/"><em>Ambidextro</em></a> and it&#39;s from Majorariatto, which self-published the game (the two-person studio&#39;s tagline is &quot;Video games that ruin lives&quot;). The gist here is that you play a wizard sent by a queen to rescue her children after a witch kidnaps them and takes them to two different places. Rather than let him try to find the princess and prince one at a time, the queen bisects the wizard and orders him to the dungeons until he learns to control both halves of his body simultaneously. That&#39;s where you come in.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="85b08ff3a9d84e5e884c926a3c427d85"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnuyOmAkmtw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>There are 100 single-screen levels in <em>Ambidextro</em> and you complete them by controlling each half of the wizard at the same time. One with the left thumbstick and the jump button of your choice, and one with the right. The aim is to bring the two halves of the wizard together. The timer doesn&#39;t leave much room for error and when one half dies, it&#39;s back to the start. Sure, you could cheat by getting a friend to control one of the wizard halves, but that defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>I am a truly horrible multitasker, so I was curious how well I&#39;d do at playing <em>Ambidextro</em>. As it turns out, I got through the first 19 levels fairly quickly, and then I was absolutely rotten at it. Granting myself more time through the accessibility settings helped a bit, but it&#39;s still a tough game. I&#39;m going to stick with it to see if I can get better. There&#39;s no way it could be as difficult as simultaneously playing two characters in <em>Overcooked </em>by myself. Now, that&#39;s impossible.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/mycopunk-is-an-upbeat-love-letter-to-extraction-shooters-192337609.html"><em>Mycopunk</em></a> is a co-op shooter from developer Pigeons at Play and publisher Devolver Digital that arrived in early access <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">on Steam</a> this week. With a Moebius-style look that reminds me a bit of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-23-sable-hands-on.html"><em>Sable</em></a>, the fantastic <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rollerdrome-preview-olliolli-skates-ps5-steam-160030108.html"><em>Rollerdrome</em></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-up-to-september-12-154958162.html">Borderlands</a> series, <em>Mycopunk</em> is certainly eye-catching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can team up with three friends and play as robots that have been hired to eradicate a fungus that&#39;s infected a valuable world. Each of the robots has their own moveset and class, but (as in the Borderlands games) there&#39;s a great deal of variety and customization when it comes to the weaponry.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/inscryption-ps4-ps5-daniel-mullins-devolver-digital-163439697.html"><em>Inscryption</em></a> showed what&#39;s possible when you inject horror into a card-based game, and perhaps that was an influence for <em>Occlude</em>, which is <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547010/Occlude/">out now on Steam</a>. This is billed as a &quot;game of occult Solitaire.&quot; Sure, you&#39;ll arrange cards by numerical rank, but it seems there&#39;s more going on here than might first meet the eye. As the title suggests, the rules are somewhat obscured in this narrative puzzle title from Tributary Games and publisher Pantaloon. Can you figure &#39;em out?</p>

<p><em>Everdeep Aurora</em> is an interesting-looking game from Ysbryd Games that landed on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2251400/Everdeep_Aurora/">Steam</a> and Nintendo Switch this week. This NES-inspired 2D adventure reminds me a little of <em>Animal Well</em> in terms of its tone and look. You play as a cat named Shell who drills down to search for her missing mother amid a meteor shower that has wrecked the planet&#39;s surface. There&#39;s a mix of platforming and exploration here. <em>Everdeep Aurora</em> looks rather pretty and the trailer made me smile. I&#39;m hoping to play it at some point down the line.</p>

<p>I do love a side-scrolling beat-&#39;em-up and <em>Ra Ra Boom</em> is absolutely one of those. This project from Gylee Games features four ninja cheerleaders from outer space who are trying to save Earth from a rogue AI. This is a co-op game for up to four players. Each of the cheerleaders has their own attacks and abilities (including ranged weapons), as well as a skill tree that you can use to unlock new ones.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve played a chunk of <em>Ra Ra Boom</em> and I&#39;m enjoying it quite a bit so far. It looks and sounds nice, and the combat is just the right level of challenging for me up to this point. If you dig games like the Streets of Rage series and <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-185022231.html"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge</em></a>, you might be interested in checking this out. A two-level demo is available on <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2335060/Ra_Ra_BOOM/">Steam</a> now. <em>Ra Ra Boom</em> is coming to Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox and PS5 on August 12.</p>

<p><em>Rhythm of Resistance</em> is a Metroidvania that has a very interesting mechanic. It&#39;s a rhythm-based game (no points for guessing that after reading its title), but there&#39;s a catch — you can pick the music. For instance, you can switch to a track with a lower BPM to make a trap easier to bypass. You can find new songs that can distort reality &quot;in strange and surprising ways&quot; while you&#39;re on your journey in this game from NetherMoon Game Studio, which is slated to arrive on <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269550/Rhythm_of_Resistance/">Steam</a> next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-stylish-shooter-occult-solitaire-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110019324.html?src=rss
