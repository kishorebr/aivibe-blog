<p>According to the alleged Ubisoft post, the Far Cry franchise adaptation will be an &quot;anthology drama&quot; where &quot;each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise&#39;s signature standalone storytelling format.&quot; The series is reportedly being co-created by Rob Mac, known for creating and starring in <em>It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>, and Noah Hawley, who created <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Legion</em> for FX. The leaked release supposedly detailed that Hawley will serve as the showrunner for the series, while also filling the role of executive producer along with Mac. Several production studios have reportedly joined the project, including Ubisoft Film &amp; Television, which is working on other video game adaptations for the Assassin&#39;s Creed and Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell franchises.</p>
