<p>CES always has its share of attention-grabbing robots. But this year in particular seemed to be a landmark year for robotics. The advancement in AI technology has not only given robots better “brains,” it’s enabled new levels of autonomy and given rise to an ambitious, if sometimes questionable, vision for our robot-filled future.</p><p>From sassy humanoids to AI-powered pets and chore-handling assistants, we sought out as many cute, strange and capable robots as we could find in Las Vegas. These are the ones that made the biggest impression. </p><h2 id="jump-link-agibot-humanoids">Agibot Humanoids</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/AGIBOT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/AGIBOT.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Agibot&#39;s X2 humanoid robot." data-uuid="3a01524f-e817-457f-b4c8-7b54dd31b686"><figcaption>Agibot&#39;s X2 humanoid robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Of all the humanoids we saw at CES, Agibot&#39;s made <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/agibots-humanoid-robots-can-give-directions-and-learn-your-tiktok-dances-045049798.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the biggest impression</a>. The company was showing off two models: the larger A2 and the smaller X2 (pictured above). The latter impressed us with its dance moves — the company told us it can learn surprisingly complex choreography — but the A2 turned out to be surprisingly capable at chatting up CES goers.</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/JmloGyVi" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Later in the show, we came across the A2 at IntBot&#39;s booth, where the company had custom versions of both Agibot humanoids &quot;running&quot; their booth. I spent several minutes talking with &quot;Nylo&quot; and was genuinely impressed by its conversational skills, even if its roasts could use a little work. — <em>Karissa Bell, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-dreames-robo-vac-arms-and-legs">Dreame&#39;s robo vac arms and legs</h2><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/ISC3Yfps" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Dreame was back this year with some wild robot vacuums.

There are two versions of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ollobot.com/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OlloBot</a>, one that&#39;s short with a fixed neck and another where the neck can stretch out to make it much taller.

Instead of using an arm to grab one thing at a time, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.clutterbot.com/" data-i13n="slk:Clutterbot&#39;s Rovie;cpos:6;pos:1">Clutterbot&#39;s Rovie</a> has a dustpan-style tray with two sweepers that fold out from its front. It drives around and, using computer vision, identifies toys that have been left on the floor and scoops them up. Then, it dumps them in a designated bin where they&#39;re consolidated and out of the way.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s still in the R&amp;D phase, a team member said when I visited the booth, but this is one I&#39;m hoping to see become a real, purchasable product soon. For parents of small children who are constantly leaving their toys around, it would be pretty convenient to have a tiny robot picking up after them. Also for me, who doesn&#39;t have children but a very sweet and hardworking cat who loves to steal socks and then deliver them as if they&#39;re her kills, leaving socks scattered all over the house. Clutterbot team, if you&#39;re reading this, please add socks to the list of items Rovie can sweep up. <em>— CM</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-saros-rover">Saros Rover</h2><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/LKggaq0o" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Not to be outdone, Roborock also brought a stairclimbing robot vacuum to CES, Saros Rover. And, unlike Dreame&#39;s prototype, the Roborock can also clean the stairs while it climbs. No word on when it will be available or how much it might cost (probably a lot!) but the company says it is &quot;a real product in development.&quot;&nbsp;<em>-KB</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-cloid">CLOiD</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_heart_eyes.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_heart_eyes.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="CLOiD folded laundry at LG&#39;s CES booth." data-uuid="9578699e-d376-497c-955d-8cb483dd663c"><figcaption>CLOiD folded laundry at LG&#39;s CES booth.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>LG&#39;s CLOiD was definitely the most ambitious robot we saw at CES 2026.

But while the 15-minute demo gave us a tantalizing look at the appliance maker&#39;s vision for a &quot;zero labor home,&quot; it&#39;s unlikely to be anything more than a slick demo anytime soon. The company has made no commitment to actually make a version of CLOiD people can actually buy. — <em>KB</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-allex">Allex</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0971.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0971.JPG" style="height:2833px;width:4151px;" alt="WIRobotics&#39; Allex robot makes a heart sign with its hands" data-uuid="fd1b54ab-68c7-43f5-8198-40667de33c6c"><figcaption>WIRobotics&#39; Allex robot makes a heart sign with its hands.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.wirobotics.com/media/newsDetail?pageType=01&amp;idx=75&amp;page=1" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">WIRobotics</a> brought its new humanoid, Allex, to CES, and the robot was really hamming it up when we stopped by the booth, striking poses and engaging with visitors. It&#39;s a waist-up robot with articulated parts, from its arms to its fingers, and is meant to be a general purpose tool that could be used in manufacturing, the service industry or even households. Each hand can hold objects of up to about 6.6 lbs, and the robotic hand has 15 degrees of freedom. The company&#39;s website shows the robot&#39;s fingers are dexterous enough to do <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://d2nxb27ysr05sd.cloudfront.net/erp/news/b6bfee7cf7194fc4bc0c2b687ac25dac_20250820_111954.jpeg" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">the Gen-Z heart</a> sign, but when it looked at Karissa and me it threw a millennial heart up.

Well, technically it&#39;s an AI companion shaped like a fuzzy, portable meerkat. It might look like a toy, but the company says it&#39;s actually to be a companion for adults. </p><p>It’s small enough you can carry it around with you throughout the day (Sharp even makes a tiny Poketomo-sized clear backpack). Like a lot of AI companion devices we saw at CES, it’s  equipped with a small camera and microphone that enables it to constantly interact with you. The camera also enables its “memory” so the pet can recognize and deliver personalized updates to its person. Poketomo launched recently in Japan, but sadly Sharp says it has no current plans to sell it in other markets. — <em>KB</em></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnM1eoi4vXo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-bibo">Bibo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1014.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1014.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A Labubu-like AI toy with brown fur and big eyes and wearing a gray sweater " data-uuid="e114caf3-9a5c-423a-aae2-03331a233275"><figcaption>Moony bibo (I-Type).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>It seemed like everyone was trying to cash in on Labubu hype at CES 2026.

The egg-shaped creature can scoot around on a wheeled base, or you can carry it around with you.&nbsp;</p><p>But what we loved about Cocomo is that it&#39;s not trying to be yet another AI assistant, give out life advice or perform tasks. Its goal is to provide companionship and well, be your friend. And while it can respond to voice input it doesn&#39;t exactly have a voice of its own: it communicates via cute humming sounds, which is a lot less creepy than some of the talking robots we saw. — <em>KB</em>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-yonbo">Yonbo&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0911.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0911.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="Yonbo AI companion, a children&#39;s dog-like robot, pictured at CES Unveiled" data-uuid="fe3228d7-5891-4c66-81b3-dc65cecec22d"><figcaption>Yonbo at CES.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://yonbo.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">Yonbo</a> is a kids&#39; AI companion robot that totally charmed us. It kind of looks like a dog, and when we visited its booth at Unveiled, there were four of them playfully bopping their heads to a pop song and cycling through different cute facial expressions and emoji eyes (including bowls of ramen). It&#39;s designed to be an intelligent playmate that can tag along for activities, talk with a child and read them stories, and even help them work through emotions, like getting frustrated during a game.&nbsp;</p><p>Yonbo&#39;s movement is controlled by a wristband, so it doesn&#39;t require a phone to play with. It can also be used as an extra pair of eyes for parents around the house. In Parental Monitor mode, which the team says is the only time its camera will be able to stream and store video, parents are able to see what Yonbo sees. The robot costs $800 and is available now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>— CM</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-mofo">MÖFO</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1031.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1031.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="will.i.am&#39;s latest tech product, MOFO pictured at CES.

We read it and all the accompanying materials over and over trying to figure out what, exactly, this thing does. Some of the claims that added to this confusion: &quot;the agent &#39;octopuses&#39; across your digital ecosystem through its eight USB-C connections&quot;; it &quot;converts moments into objects&quot;; it &quot;turns life notes into a life operating system.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>We get it now, (we think): It&#39;s agentic AI hardware, kind of like a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-r1-review-a-199-ai-toy-that-fails-at-almost-everything-161043050.html" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">Rabbit R1</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">AI Pin</a> but in the form of a teddy bear. Sadly, we didn&#39;t get to see MÖFO up close or watch it do anything, but we are nonetheless intrigued, if still a bit confused, by this strange teddy bear. — <em>CM and KB</em><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2026-the-lovable-the-creepy-and-the-utterly-confusing-153537930.html?src=rss
