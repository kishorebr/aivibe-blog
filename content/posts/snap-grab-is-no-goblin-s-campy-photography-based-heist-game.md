<p>Photography games can be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/lushfoil-photography-sim">hyper-realistic simulations</a> of the real thing or a vehicle for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date-april-30-140842000.html">ogling cute creatures</a>, but No Goblin's <em>Snap &amp; Grab</em> is forging a different path by treating photography as a key ingredient in a good heist. The upcoming game as part of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-day-of-the-devs-at-summer-game-fest-2025-150047219.html">Day of the Devs showcase</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, ahead of its launch in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on the trailer, <em>Snap &amp; Grab</em> can be broken into two distinct parts. There's the snapping, where you'll play as a professional photographer grooving through (high-fashion) high society, taking pictures of things you want to steal. And the grabbing, where you'll lay out those photos in a workflow of sorts for your team of thieves to follow during a heist. Some of the things you'll photograph might be obstacles or parts of the environment you can manipulate in your favor and it looks like more than a few could just be cute pictures of dogs.</p>

<p>Like No Goblin's other games, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://100ftrobotgolf.com/"><em>100ft Robot Golf</em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://nogoblin.com/roundabout"><em>Roundabout</em></a>, over-the-top, silly theming is the name of the game. In the case of <em>Snap &amp; Grab</em>, that's a sort of cartoon-y 80's aesthetic â€” think <em>Miami Vice</em> by way of <em>Johnny Bravo</em> and you'll be in the ballpark of the hair and shoulder pads No Goblin is playing with.</p>
<p>Luckily, you won't have to wait long to see the game for yourself. No Goblin says <em>Snap &amp; Grab</em> is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X / S in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/snap-grab-is-no-goblins-campy-photography-based-heist-game-000024233.html?src=rss
