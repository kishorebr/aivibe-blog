(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)"Today, Chinese-made open-weight models are unavoidable in the global competitive AI landscape," said Meinhardt and collaborators. The report shows that Chinese large language models (LLMs),
