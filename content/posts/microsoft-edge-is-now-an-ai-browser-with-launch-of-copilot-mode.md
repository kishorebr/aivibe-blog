With demand for AI-powered browsers on the rise, Microsoft on Monday launched a new feature in its Edge browser called Copilot Mode, which allows users to browse the web while being assisted by AI. The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.

How well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It’s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with access to Copilot.


	
	




	
	



There are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.

Once enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot’s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.

This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.

Or, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the “life story” that now accompanies so many online recipes.

In addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user’s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.

This “agentic” use of the web is the next big leap in the AI browser race, but it’s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just
