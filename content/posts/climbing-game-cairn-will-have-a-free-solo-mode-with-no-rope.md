<p>If you tried the demo for upcoming climbing game <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/survival-climber-cairn-ascends-to-ps5-and-pc-on-november-5-215529242.html"><em>Cairn</em></a> and somehow found it too easy, you&#39;re in for a treat. Developer The Game Bakers announced at the latest Future Games Show that <em>Cairn</em> will include <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8aqVg7TCEI">a &quot;Free Solo&quot; mode</a> that lets you tackle the game&#39;s already difficult climbs without pitons or a rope.</p>
<p>A typical climb in <em>Cairn</em> — and most rock climbing games for that matter — tasks you with managing rope, and the pitons you use to anchor it to a rock face. You add pitons as you climb so that in the event you slip, you only fall to your last piton rather than all the way to the ground. In Free Solo mode, you don&#39;t have that safety net, turning each climb into more of a roguelike run.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the real life rock climbing world, &quot;Free Solo&quot; climbing is when you tackle a climb without a partner or traditional equipment. The term rose to mainstream relevance after the release of the documentary <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRVZ4SW7WU"><em>Free Solo</em></a>, which followed climber Alex Honnold as he trained for and ultimately ascended El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>Adding a dangerous style of climbing to what&#39;s already a difficult game feels appropriate in this case. On top of a climbing mechanic that makes you move each limb individually, <em>Cairn</em> also requires you to manage your hunger, thirst and an inventory of supplies. At least based on its demo, the game is far more demanding then something like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html#:~:text=DON%27T%20NOD-,Jusant,-Available%20for%3A%20Xbox"><em>Jusant</em></a>, which was much more concerned with making its traversal fun and expressive rather than realistically difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#39;re itching for punishment, the <em>Cairn</em> demo is available to download now on PS5 and PC. The game will be released on both platforms on November 5, 2025.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/climbing-game-cairn-will-have-a-free-solo-mode-with-no-rope-213450638.html?src=rss
