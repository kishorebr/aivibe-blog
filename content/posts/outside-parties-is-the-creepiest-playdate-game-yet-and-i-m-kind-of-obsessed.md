<p>Never underestimate the chilling powers of grainy grayscale imagery and ethereal whooshing sounds. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.date/games/outside-parties/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Outside Parties</em></a> asks, &quot;What if <em>I Spy</em>, but in an alien hell dimension?&quot;, and it is impressively unnerving despite the fact that nothing&#39;s really happening at any given time. It goes all in on atmosphere, to great effect. This is the Playdate horror game that I&#39;ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams Immersive&#39;s <em>Outside Parties</em> is a sort of scavenger hunt across a massive image of a realm called the Outside, which can only be visited by astral travel, according to the lore. There are lots of unknowns about what or where it really is, though explorers have mapped it fairly extensively through out-of-body excursions and they&#39;ve encountered thousands of different entities there, including the spirits of the dead. As the player, you have come across a Hellscryer K5 — the communication device, psychic camera and recorder used for these trips — and now you&#39;re combing through the mission logs, getting sucked into the mystery of it all. Think of the K5 as your Playdate, except powered by blood and runes.</p>
<p>At the center of <em>Outside Parties</em> is a 1.44 gigapixel, 360-degree panoramic HDR image which has dozens of eerie scenes hidden within it: skeletons of human, animal and paranormal origin; scary robed figures and occult symbols etched all around; what appear to be fountains and rivers of blood; a Stonehenge of teeth. These are the targets you&#39;re meant to track down, and as you hone in and check them off your list, voice signals attached to each one will reveal more and more of the explorer&#39;s spellbinding story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t a straightforward &quot;find the object&quot; puzzle game by any means. When you first look at the zoomed-out photo, it&#39;s akin to a strip of TV static with some heavily shadowed areas throughout. You can zoom to up to 64 times magnification to get a better look at specific zones, but you also have to adjust the image brightness using the crank to improve the clarity of the objects. Making it brighter or darker will reveal more objects in certain spots while simultaneously obscuring others. There are 150 targets according to the developer, which should take players somewhere from 10-20 hours to complete. I&#39;ve been at it for hours and still have plenty left to find. (If you&#39;re stuck, you can turn to the helpful <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://adamsimmersive.com/apps/outside-parties/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">target lookup</a> page, which provides hints with varying degrees of specificity.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the while as you&#39;re hunched over your Playdate, laser-focused on the screen to find targets that are buried in a sea of fuzz, unsettling audio transmissions are cutting in and out, disturbing images are flashing on-screen at random and a constant atmospheric whooshing is playing in your ear. The sound design of this game is seriously brilliant — it&#39;s worth playing for that alone, not to mention all the other cool stuff. From the startup page to the menus where you&#39;ll find bits of a background story, to the creepy clips of people wailing and ominously reciting numbers, the sounds of <em>Outside Parties</em> make for a truly immersive, disconcerting experience that I previously wouldn&#39;t have thought possible on a Playdate. It&#39;s really something special.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outside Parties</em> also comes with a screensaver that once again makes me yearn for the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/panic-hits-pause-on-the-playdate-stereo-dock-says-its-unlikely-well-see-it-anytime-soon-191607744.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Playdate Stereo Dock</a>. Pop on the Void Monitor, sit back, and enjoy the horrifying sights and sounds of the Outside.&nbsp;</p>
