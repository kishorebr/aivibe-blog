Certain agents are hogging all the headlines lately, but there are a number of function-specific agents available to developers and users. MIT's CSAIL -- the university lab dedicated to AI research -- set out to identify and document the background and capabilities of these agents, with its findings detailed in its latest AI Agent Index. The researchers conducted an ecosystem-wide analysis of state-of-the-art AI agents across 1,350 data points.  Also: AI agents are fast, loose, and out of control, MIT study finds What is the functionality and origin of leading agents? The researchers found that interfaces are the most abundant, followed closely by enterprise workflow platforms. They also uncovered risks shared across these agents, as explored by my ZDNET colleague Tiernan Ray. Agents featured in the MIT index include the following:Anthropic Claude/Claude CodeGoogle Gemini/Gemini CLIManus AI OpenAI ChatGPT/ChatGPT Agent/Codex/AgentKitPerplexity Alibaba MobileAgent ByteDance Agent TARSPerplexity Comet IBM watsonx OrchestrateMicrosoft 365 CopilotSAP Joule StudioSalesforce AgentforceServiceNow AI Agents
