<p>The Programmed Data Processor-1 (PDP-1) is perhaps most recognizable as the home of <em>Spacewar!, </em>one of the world&#39;s first video games, but as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wubkrBd3-gg">the video</a> above proves, it also works as an enormous and very slow iPod, too.</p>
<p>In the video, Boards of Canada&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_lzNFjqGiw&amp;list=RD6_lzNFjqGiw&amp;start_radio=1">&quot;Olson&quot;</a> is playing off of paper tape that&#39;s carefully fed and programmed into the PDP-1 by engineer and Computer History Museum docent Peter Samson. It&#39;s the final product of Joe Lynch&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://pdp1.music">PDP-1.music</a> project, an attempt to translate the short and atmospheric song into something the PDP-1 can reproduce.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Lynch <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://github.com/joeblynch/pdp-1-boc">writes on GitHub</a>, the &quot;Harmony Compiler&quot; used to translate &quot;Olson&quot; to paper tape was actually created by Samson to play audio through four of computer&#39;s lightbulbs while he was a student at MIT in the 1960s. He used it to recreate classical music, but it&#39;ll work with &#39;90s electronic music in a pinch, too.</p>
<p>&quot;While these bulbs were originally intended to provide program status information to the computer operator,&quot; Lynch writes, &quot;Peter repurposed four of these light bulbs into four square wave generators (or four 1-bit DACs, put another way), by turning the bulbs on and off at audio frequencies.&quot; The signal from each bulb is then downmixed into stereo audio channels, transcribed via an emulator and merged into a single file that has to be manually punched into the paper tape that&#39;s fed into the PDP-1.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a laborious process for playing even the simplest of songs, but it&#39;s worth it to hear Boards of Canada&#39;s already nostalgic music from an even older classic computer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/someone-programmed-a-65-year-old-computer-to-play-boards-of-canadas-olson-220857441.html?src=rss
