<p>Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/meta-takes-legal-action-against-scam-advertisers/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has sued</a> the people and groups behind three scam operations that used images and deepfakes of celebrities to lure users to scam websites. According to the company, the three entities were based in China and Brazil and targeted people in the US, Japan and other countries. The ads promoted fraudulent investment schemes and fake health products.</p><p>Meta said that it had filed lawsuits against several people in Brazil who promoted fake or unapproved healthcare products and online courses promoting them. The company also sued a China-based entity it says used ads featuring celebrities &quot;as part of a larger fraud scheme that lured people into joining so-called investment groups.&quot; The company didn&#39;t provide details on how many ads these groups had run on Facebook, how many social media users had seen or interacted with the ads or how long the scammers had been operating on the platform.</p><p>So-called &quot;celeb bait&quot; ads have been a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jamie-lee-curtis-publicly-shamed-mark-zuckerberg-to-remove-a-deepfaked-ad-225448916.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">long-running</a> issue for the company. Engadget has previously documented celeb bait scams on Facebook, including ones that frequently use Elon Musk and <em>Fox News</em> personalities to hawk <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-scammers-want-you-to-think-elon-musk-can-cure-diabetes-153042842.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">fake cures for diabetes</a>. The Oversight Board has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-says-meta-isnt-doing-enough-to-fight-celeb-deepfake-scams-194636203.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">also criticized</a> the company for not doing enough to combat such scams. In its update, Meta says that &quot;because scam ads are designed to look real, they’re not always easy to detect.&quot; The company also noted that it has now enrolled &quot;more than 500,000&quot; celebrities and public figures into its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-back-facial-recognition-with-new-safety-features-for-facebook-and-instagram-222523426.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">facial recognition system</a> that&#39;s meant to automatically detect scam ads using the faces of famous people.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta&#39;s handling of scammy advertisers has come under increased scrutiny in recent months after <em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-making-billions-of-dollars-from-scam-ads-on-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-report-says-184128645.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">reported</a> that researchers at the company at one point estimated that as much as 10 percent of its ad revenue could be coming from scams and banned products. The fact that Meta has made billions of dollars from problematic advertisers has also caused the company to be slow to take action against repeat offenders.</p><p>In addition to the groups behind the celeb bait ads, Meta says that it&#39;s upgraded its ability to detect scam ads that use <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://searchengineland.com/affiliate-cloaking-is-behind-45-of-fraud-heres-how-to-beat-it-460868" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">cloaking</a>, which has at times hindered its internal review systems. The company also sued a Vietnam-based advertiser it says used scam ads to hawk &quot;deeply discounted items from well-known brands,&quot; including Longchamp.</p><p>Meta also took legal action against eight former &quot;Meta Business Partners,&quot; who promoted services that would &quot;un-ban&quot; or other &quot;account restoration services.&quot; The company says it will &quot;consider taking additional legal action, including litigation, if they don’t comply&quot; with cease and desist orders.</p><p><strong>Update, February 26, 2026, 1:16PM PT: </strong>This story was updated to specify that Meta’s internal estimates around ad revenue included scams and banned products.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-sues-advertisers-in-brazil-and-china-over-celeb-bait-scams-190000268.html?src=rss
