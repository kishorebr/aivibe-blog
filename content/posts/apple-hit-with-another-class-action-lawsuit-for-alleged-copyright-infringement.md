<p>Just about a month after being <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-faces-lawsuit-over-alleged-use-of-pirated-books-for-ai-training-160016161.html">accused of using pirated</a> books to train its AI, Apple is facing another similar proposed class action lawsuit. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/apple-accused-of-ai-copyright-infringement-by-suny-professors"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a>, two neuroscience professors from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, NY, claimed that Apple used their &quot;registered works without authorization.&quot; The neuroscientists, Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, said Apple trained its AI models using &quot;shadow libraries&quot; and &quot;web-crawling software&quot; that provide access to pirated, copyrighted books, including two of their own.</p>
<p>In the previous class action lawsuit, a separate pair of authors also alleged that Apple committed copyright infringement when using published works to train Apple Intelligence models without consent. Apple isn&#39;t the only tech giant facing copyright lawsuits related to its AI, as OpenAI is in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-no-longer-has-to-preserve-all-of-its-chatgpt-data-with-some-exceptions-192422093.html">similar situation</a> after being sued by <em>The New York Times</em> for similar accusations. While these AI models are relatively new, there&#39;s already a case that may have set some precedent. Earlier this year, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-pay-a-record-breaking-15-billion-to-settle-copyright-lawsuit-with-authors-192800292.html">Anthropic</a> settled a class action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $1.5 billion to 500,000 authors involved in the case, which revolved around copyright claims.</p>
