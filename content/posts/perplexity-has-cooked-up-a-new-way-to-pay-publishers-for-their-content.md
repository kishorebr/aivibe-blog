<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Perplexity is launching a new revenue-sharing plan for publishers that will pay them every time its AI assistants use an article to answer a question, </span><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=469c90ca-b0ad-4a16-bdf5-444273bd470c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=The+Wall+Street+Journal+reports&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21lZGlhL3BlcnBsZXhpdHktYWktc2VhcmNoLXB1Ymxpc2hlci1yZXZlbnVlLTUwNzk4N2U1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NjljOTBjYS1iMGFkLTRhMTYtYmRmNS00NDQyNzNiZDQ3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzai5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvcGVycGxleGl0eS1haS1zZWFyY2gtcHVibGlzaGVyLXJldmVudWUtNTA3OTg3ZTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAczgBfTxMYrQ2_wSiYoOVCzSpopoE0fDI3w5lGXTfqDl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fperplexity-ai-search-publisher-revenue-507987e5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/perplexity-ai-search-publisher-revenue-507987e5"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">.

The money shared through Comet Plus will presumably account for what&#39;s lost when an AI agent visits a webpage on your behalf, zooming past ads you&#39;d normally see or hear.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Publishers will get 80 percent of the revenue of Comet Plus, according to Perplexity, with the remaining 20 percent allocated to &quot;compute.&quot; <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> writes that Perplexity will initially pay participating publishers out of a &quot;$42.5 million revenue pool&quot; that will expand over time, presumably as sign-ups grow for Comet Plus, and the Comet web browser becomes available to more people. That starting sum likely takes into account Perplexity&#39;s existing Pro and </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-joins-anthropic-and-openai-in-offering-a-200-per-month-subscription-191715149.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Max</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> subscribers, who will receive Comet Plus as part of their subscriptions and are paying into the revenue-sharing scheme by default.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It sounds generous on its face, and maybe with a large enough volume of subscribers it will be, but 80 percent of $5 is $4. That&#39;s $4 that will presumably unlock unlimited access to a publication&#39;s entire library of content. Most newspapers charge anywhere from $20 to $30 per month to access all of their articles. Why would they settle for less?</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It&#39;s not clear if this plan replaces Perplexity&#39;s existing Publisher Program, or will exist alongside it. It&#39;s also hard to say if not paying for Comet Plus will change the quality of responses you receive in Comet or Perplexity. Engadget has contacted Perplexity for more information and will update this article if we hear back.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Perplexity likely wouldn&#39;t be exploring new revenue-sharing plans if it hadn&#39;t already been </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-companies-are-reportedly-still-scraping-websites-despite-protocols-meant-to-block-them-132308524.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">caught plagiarizing articles</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> in the first place. The company wants its agentic browser to be a success, and that ideally requires a certain amount of participation from the people who create the articles, images, and videos agents browse. It remains to be seen if Comet Plus is the kind of arrangement that will make publishers play ball.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-has-cooked-up-a-new-way-to-pay-publishers-for-their-content-204255019.html?src=rss
