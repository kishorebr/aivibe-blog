<p>The official <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV/featured"><ins>Pokémon TV YouTube</ins></a> channel is continuing its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1940486087149080642"><ins>summer movie watch party</ins></a> with another classic: <em>Pokémon the Movie 2000</em>. The entire movie is available to watch now for free, for a limited time. It follows <em>Pokémon: The First Movie</em>, which was temporarily released on the channel in July, and next up will be <em>Pokémon 3: The Movie. </em>I have distinct memories of seeing these movies in theaters, so the nostalgia is hitting pretty hard right about now.</p>
<p>In case you need a little refresher on where the second Pokémon movie picks up:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>In the Orange Islands, far south of Kanto, a Trainer named Lawrence is on a sinister quest: catching Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, the three Legendary bird Pokémon, in an attempt to awaken Lugia, guardian of the sea! When Ash and friends arrive, the islanders ask him to gather three elemental orbs from different islands—and when the weather across the world goes out of control, this task takes on a new importance, as the capture of the Legendary trio has thrown the environment out of balance! With Lugia’s help, can Ash be the “chosen one” that everyone turns to?</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not clear how long the movie will stay up on the YouTube channel — <em>The First Movie</em> has already been taken down after its brief run — so if you&#39;re interested, you should probably get to it sooner rather than later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/you-can-watch-pokemon-the-movie-2000-for-free-on-youtube-right-now-213303624.html?src=rss
