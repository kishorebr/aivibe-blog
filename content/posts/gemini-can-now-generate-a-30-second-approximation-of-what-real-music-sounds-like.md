<div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TD6FPndjhoE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that using its newly incorporated Lyria 3 model, Gemini users will be able to generate 30-second music tracks based on a prompt, or remix an existing track to their liking. The new model builds on Gemini&#39;s pre-existing ability to generate text, images and video, and will also be available in YouTube&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-creators-can-now-make-ai-song-remixes-for-shorts-143015775.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;Dream Track&quot;</a> feature, where it can be used to generate detailed backing tracks for Shorts.</p><p>Like some other music generation tools, prompting Gemini doesn&#39;t require a lot of detail to produce serviceable results. Google&#39;s example prompt is &quot;a comical R&amp;B slow jam about a sock finding their match,&quot; but after playing with Lyria 3, you can definitely get more granular about individual elements of a track — changing the tempo or the style of drumming, for example — if you want to. Outside of text, Gemini can also generate music based on a photo or video, and tracks can be paired with album art created by Google&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Nano Banana image model</a>.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/upqObgO0GuE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Google says that Lyria 3 improves on its previous audio generation models in its ability to create more &quot;realistic and musically complex&quot; tracks, give prompters more control over individual components of a song and automatically generate lyrics. Gemini&#39;s outputs are limited to 30-second clips for now, but given how Google&#39;s promotional video shows off the feature, it&#39;s not hard to imagine those clips getting longer or the model getting incorporated into other apps, like Google Messages.</p><p>Like Gemini&#39;s other AI-generated outputs, songs made with Lyria 3 are also watermarked with Google&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-an-invisible-digital-watermark-to-bring-transparency-to-ai-art-164551794.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">SynthID</a>, so a Gemini clip can&#39;t as easily be passed off as a human one. Google started rolling out its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/synthid-detector-can-check-media-to-see-if-it-was-generated-with-googles-ai-tools-194002070.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">SynthID Detector</a> for identifying AI-generated content at Google I/O 2025. The sample tracks Google included alongside its announcement are convincing, but you might not need the company&#39;s tool to notice their machine-made qualities. The instrumental parts of Gemini’s clips often sound great, but the composition of the lyrics Lyria 3 produces sounds alternately corny and strange.</p><p>If you&#39;re curious to try Lyria 3 for yourself, Google says you can prompt tracks in Gemini starting today, provided you&#39;re 18 years or older and speak English, Spanish, German, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean or Portuguese.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-generate-a-30-second-approximation-of-what-real-music-sounds-like-204445903.html?src=rss
