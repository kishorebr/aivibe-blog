<p>China&#39;s new five-year plan — an overarching policy proposal for the next term of Chinese Communist Party leadership — is focused on making the nation technologically self-reliant and less vulnerable to foreign pressure, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/china-deepens-bid-for-tech-self-reliance-in-new-development-plan" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. The plan has yet to be officially adopted, but is being released ahead of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ustr-greer-treasurys-bessent-heading-malaysia-talks-with-chinese-counterparts-2025-10-22/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a summit</a> between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>The main focus of the proposal is to make China&#39;s tech and science industries self-reliant and less dependent on products created by international companies. <em>Bloomberg</em> writes that the proposal is particularly interested in developing &quot;fields such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence&quot; which are currently driven in part by products from US companies like Nvidia and OpenAI. China also hopes to &quot;bolster domestic consumption&quot; and make the country less dependent on exporting, a business that&#39;s been thrown into chaos by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-threatens-a-25-percent-tariff-on-all-smartphones-not-made-in-the-us-195122531.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a fluctuating tariff regime</a> set by the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-communist-party-fourth-plenum-five-year-plan-9596d3180c06497f42b45a9a4fff6ab9" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Per the <em>AP</em></a>, this new five-year plan mostly builds on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/china-five-year-plan-for-technology-225618577.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">previous five-year plan</a> China set during Trump&#39;s first-term, which focused on investing in technology as part of the country&#39;s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the new plan aims to continue <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-breaks-more-records-with-massive-build-up-of-wind-and-solar-power" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">the growth of China&#39;s wind and solar industries</a> and &quot;accelerate the all-out green transformation of economic and social development.&quot;</p><p>In the context of the US and China&#39;s back and forth over <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-may-give-us-government-a-cut-of-its-profits-to-sell-ai-chips-to-china-120003260.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">international trade</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">access to resources</a>, the new plan, as reported by <em>Bloomberg</em> and the <em>AP</em>, seems like a response to the growing tensions between the two countries. One that could make China less burdened by the US moving forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/chinas-latest-five-year-plan-aims-for-technological-self-reliance-194551489.html?src=rss
