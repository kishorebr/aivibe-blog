<p>Confession time: I’ve had the <em>Sleep Awake</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Steam page</a> open in a tab for about a month (hey, we all organize our thoughts in unique and beautiful ways), just so I don’t forget about it. The past year has been stacked with fabulous original games across a wide range of genres, including horror, and this is one I didn’t want to miss. Now, I can close the tab and  put a firm release date on the calendar, as <em>Sleep Awake</em> is officially due to hit PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 2. Happy holidays, indeed.</p><p><em>Sleep Awake </em>is a first-person, narrative-heavy, psychedelic horror game set in the last known city on an Earth that’s been ravaged by The HUSH, a mysterious force that disappears anyone who falls asleep. Katja must stay alert and survive the city as its citizens experiment on themselves in increasingly extreme ways, attempting to achieve permanent wakefulness and outmaneuver The HUSH. Needless to say, things get weird.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1GrdtdSPh0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Sleep Awake</em> comes from Eyes Out, the studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and it’s published by Blumhouse Games. Finck is responsible for the trippy audio stylings of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, of course. This is the studio’s debut title and something they’ve been working on for four years. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Back in 2021</a>, Davis and Finck told Engadget they were focused on building an ultra-immersive, audio-driven horror experience with a nightmarish bent.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>Finck added the following: “I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater. And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Blumhouse Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-fear-the-spotlight-became-blumhouses-first-video-game-140044877.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">published its first horror project</a>, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, in October 2024 and on top of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, it has a steady stream of additional terrors in store.
