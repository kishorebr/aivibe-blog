This discount marks a record low for this model.</p>

<p>Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums. There are small variations between them, and a different model is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">best robot vacuum</a> for most people. In general, you can expect solid cleaning performance from these devices, along with accurate home mapping and an easy-to-use app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration.</p>
