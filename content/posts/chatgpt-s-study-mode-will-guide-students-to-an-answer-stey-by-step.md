<p>OpenAI is rolling out a new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/"><ins>Study Mode</ins></a> the company says is designed to give students a better understanding of complex topics. Like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-new-learning-mode-will-prompt-students-to-answer-questions-on-their-own-172057828.html"><ins>Claude&#39;s Learning Mode</ins></a>, which Anthropic introduced in April, Study Mode will see ChatGPT adopt a Socratic approach to conversations. Rather than answer a question outright, the chatbot will attempt to guide the user to their own solution, starting with questions that allow the system to calibrate its responses to their objective and understanding. Conversations then unfold using a &quot;scaffold&quot; structure, which means ChatGPT will slowly roll out information so as not to overwhelm the user with more information than they&#39;re ready to digest.</p>
<p>OpenAI says it developed Study Mode in collaboration with teachers, scientists and pedagogy experts. Rather than running on an entirely new model, the tool is powered by a series of custom system instructions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We chose this approach because it lets us quickly learn from real student feedback and improve the experience — even if it results in some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations,&quot; said OpenAI. &quot;We plan on training this behavior directly into our main models once we’ve learned what works best through iteration and student feedback.&quot;</p>
<p>Notably, OpenAI isn&#39;t making Study Mode available only to ChatGPT Edu users. Instead, the company is first rolling out the feature to logged in Free, Plus, Pro and Team users. Edu subscribers will gain access in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to find out how many students end up actually using Study Mode, as a toggle allows you to easily turn the feature on and off. And as a recent <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html"><em><ins>New York Magazine</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>article vividly detailed, AI cheating is a major problem at US colleges. For its part, OpenAI says it plans to work on making Study Mode more engaging and useful to students. The company is exploring how to offer deeper personalization through the tool, as well as ways to offer goal setting and progress tracking across conversations.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html?src=rss
