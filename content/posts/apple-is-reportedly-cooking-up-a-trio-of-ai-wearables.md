Apple is reportedly cooking up a trio of AI wearables


Late last month, The Information reported that Apple was developing an AI wearable — an AirTag-sized pendant with cameras that could be pinned to a user’s shirt. Now, Bloomberg writes that the development of such a device — along with two other AI-powered items — is accelerating as Apple looks to stay competitive with other tech giants that are racing to release similar products.

In addition to the AI pin, Apple is also speeding up the development of its upcoming AI-powered smart glasses, which have been code-named N50, the report claims. Apple obviously has competition in this space, as other companies — including Meta (which is arguably the most successful player when it comes to smart glasses) and Snap (which plans to release its “Specs” later this year) — are working on similar products.


	
	




	
	



Apple’s new smart glasses, which will supposedly include a high-resolution camera, may see a public release sooner rather than later, with Bloomberg reporting that the company is “targeting the start of production as early as December, ahead of a public release in 2027.” 

Additionally, Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on AirPods with new AI capabilities.

All of these items will be designed to connect to the iPhone and will include Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, as a critical component of the user experience, the outlet notes. The glasses are being described as “more upscale and feature-rich” than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.
