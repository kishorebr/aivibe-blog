<p>Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky and his new company, Core Designs, have been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-open-sources-the-pebble-smartwatchs-software-and-its-creator-is-making-a-new-model-220526568.html">beavering away</a> on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-spiritual-sequel-to-the-pebble-smartwatch-is-on-track-to-ship-in-july-182014025.html">new e-paper smartwatches</a> and the team has just <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal">revealed</a> the final design of the higher-end model. The Pebble Time 2 has a 1.5-inch, 64-color e-paper screen, with a touchscreen, metal frame, heart-rate monitor and (it's claimed) up to 30 days of battery life.</p> 
<p>The frame is a bit more curved than on pre-production versions of the Pebble Time 2. The top and bottom buttons on the right side are now angled rather than sitting in a straight line with the center one. With the strap attached, the Pebble Time 2 weighs about 48 grams, and the body is about 32.5 grams.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Core Designs has added more features to the smartwatch as well. The Pebble Time 2's front, rear and buttons will be made using 316 stainless steel. It will also have a multicolor RGB LED backlight, compass sensor and screw-mounted back cover. In addition, the team has incorporated a second microphone, which Migicovsky said could be used to potentially support environmental noise cancellation.</p> 
<p>It was previously confirmed that the Pebble Time 2 would have a quick-release 22mm strap, flat hardened glass lens, step and sleep tracking and a speaker. The watch will also boast a vibration function and water resistance.</p> 
<p>Core Designs plans to offer the Pebble Time 2 in four colorways, but the team hasn't settled on the options yet. Once it has, it will email everyone who has pre-ordered the smartwatch and ask them to pick a color.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Pebble Time 2 is currently scheduled to start shipping in December and it will cost $225 (the $149 Pebble Duo 2 became available last month). Migicovsky and the team <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/july-pebble-update">recently regained</a> the Pebble trademark. As such, they were able to start using the Pebble branding again and renamed what were previously called the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2.</p>
