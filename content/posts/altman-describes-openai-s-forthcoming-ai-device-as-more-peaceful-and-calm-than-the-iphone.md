“When people see it, they say, ‘that’s it?… It’s so simple.’”

That’s how OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes how he thinks people will respond to seeing the company’s forthcoming AI hardware device for the first time. 


	
	




	
	



The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless” and pocket-sized.

Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco.

Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”

Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. 

However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions.
