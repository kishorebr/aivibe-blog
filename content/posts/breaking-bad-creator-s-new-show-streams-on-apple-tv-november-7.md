<p>Apple has announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/07/apple-tv-unveils-first-look-at-vince-gilligans-new-science-fiction-drama-pluribus-starring-emmy-award-nominee-rhea-seehorn/"><em>Pluribus</em></a>, a new science fiction drama from <em>Breaking Bad </em>creator Vince Gilligan, will premiere on Apple TV+ on November 7. Gilligan was confirmed to be working on the project  <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/breaking-bad-creators-next-series-will-stream-on-apple-tv-145016952.html">back in 2022</a>, when <em>Better Call Saul</em>&#39;s Rhea Seehorn was also announced as its primary star.</p>
<p>Alongside the premiere date, Apple also released a short (somewhat ominous) <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR41iZx07O8">teaser</a> for the series that shows a hospital employee mindlessly licking donuts. <em>Pluribus</em> is supposed to follow &quot;the most miserable person on Earth&quot; (presumably Seehorn) as they &quot;save the world from happiness,&quot; but your guess is as good as mine as to how the two tie together.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple&#39;s penchant for backing science fiction shows has been well-documented at this point. The company is currently producing a television adaptation of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-neuromancer-tv-series-is-coming-to-apple-tv-103403046.html">William Gibson&#39;s <em>Neuromancer</em></a>, and has made three seasons and counting of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-trailer-184005079.html"><em>Foundation</em></a>, based on the novel series by Isaac Asimov. Toss in things like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/severance-season-two-review-even-before-the-finale-innie-rights-and-humanity-made-for-a-stronger-show-100003889.html"><em>Severance</em></a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-murderbot-tv-show-trailer-is-here-150017588.html"><em>Murderbot</em></a><em>, </em><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silo-review-wool-tv-show-123024485.html"><em>Silo</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-renews-for-all-mankind-and-announces-a-spinoff-series-set-in-the-soviet-union-173950761.html"><em>For All Mankind</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and you&#39;ve got a pretty varied catalog of sci-fi media to choose from.</p>
<p>Just how &quot;science fiction&quot; <em>Pluribus</em> will actually be remains up in the air. When reports went out in 2022 that Apple was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2022/09/vince-gilligan-next-series-rhea-seehorn-star-apple-tv-plus-two-season-order-1235124488/">ordering two seasons of the show</a>, it was described as &quot;a blended, grounded genre drama.&quot; Apple&#39;s premiere date announcement pitches the show as &quot;a genre-bending original.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Pluribus&#39; </em>nine-episode first season will premiere on November 7 with two episodes. New episodes will stream weekly after that, all the way through December 26.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/breaking-bad-creators-new-show-streams-on-apple-tv-november-7-204150489.html?src=rss
