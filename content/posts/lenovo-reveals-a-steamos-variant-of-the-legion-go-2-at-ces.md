<p>If you saw <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lenovo&#39;s Legion Go 2 launch</a> last year and thought, &quot;I&#39;ll wait for the SteamOS version,&quot; well, you&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. But at least now it&#39;s official. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company revealed the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS. The Valve-friendly variant of the gaming handheld arrives in June, starting at a pricey $1,199.</p><p>There aren&#39;t any surprises here. It&#39;s the same Lenovo Legion Go 2 hardware, with SteamOS replacing the sometimes-awkward Windows. In many ways, you could view the SteamOS Legion Go 2 as a more powerful and versatile (and expensive!) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam Deck</a>. One notable exception is the optimizations game developers often make for Valve&#39;s handheld. (Ditto for &quot;Steam Deck Verified&quot; badges on store listings to learn quickly how playable games are.)</p><p>So, all the specs from the Windows version carry over. That includes a spacious 8.8-inch OLED display at 1,920 x 1,200 and with a 144Hz VRR. You still have two tiers to choose from: Ryzen Z2 / 16GB  / 1TB or Ryzen Z2 Extreme / 32GB / 2TB. The device has a microSD slot, kickstand, detachable controllers and a 74Wh battery. At 2.2 lbs, it&#39;s a bulky affair, so you&#39;ll want to look elsewhere if a light, compact handheld is your priority.</p><p>Lenovo says the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS is expected in June. It will start at $1,199 for the entry-level variant. (Lenovo hasn&#39;t yet announced pricing for the Z2 Extreme tier.)
