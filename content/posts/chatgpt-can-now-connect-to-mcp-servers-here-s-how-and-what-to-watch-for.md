In a rare move among competitors, companies including Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have adopted the open protocol in recent months due to its ability to power AI agents with previously inaccessible data sources -- a huge benefit to businesses navigating siloed information. Earlier this month, OpenAI made MCP available in ChatGPT alongside a host of other business-forward features. It can be used to connect your tools with Deep Research, allowing employees to access company data through the chatbot. OpenAI initially adopted MCP in April, beginning with its SDK. Currently, capabilities are limited to search and document retrieval.  Also: I tested ChatGPT's Deep Research against Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok AI to see which is best(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) In a platform guide, the company explains that users simply need to build an MCP server for Deep Research using the search and fetch tools. They should then make a custom deep research connector in ChatGPT and provide it with thorough instructions to ensure the bot is set up to engage with your system. ChatGPT Enterprise, Edu, and Team users can also publish the connector to their larger workspaces, where it can function as a knowledge source in Deep Research.OpenAI offers guidance
