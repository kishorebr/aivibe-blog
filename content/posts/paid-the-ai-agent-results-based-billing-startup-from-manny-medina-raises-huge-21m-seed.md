Manny Medina, previously best-known as the founder of sales automation startup Outreach ($4.4 billion valuation), has wowed investors with his young startup, Paid.

Paid just closed an oversubscribed $21.6 million seed round led by Lightspeed. With the €10 million pre-seed round it raised in March, London-based Paid has already raised $33.3 million and hasn’t even hit its Series A yet. A source familiar with the deal says the startup’s valuation is over $100 million.


	
	




	
	



Paid came out of stealth in March offering an interesting contribution to the AI agentic world: The company doesn’t offer agents. It offers a way for agent makers to charge their customers for these worker algorithms, based on the value their agents provide. This is a growing theme in AI, sometimes called “results-based billing.”

Paid promises to help agent makers “start charging for points of margin saved by their customers,” Medina describes. 

It’s a new way of charging for software for the AI age. This is instead of the unlimited use, per-user fees of the SaaS era, or the unlimited use, buy-it-once-and-install-it fees of the client/server era. 

Per-user fees don’t work because agent makers pay usage fees to the model providers as well as to cloud providers. Unlimited use could drive them into the red. (The vibe coding startup world tends to suffer from this issue.) 

Agent providers instead “need to show the value the agent is delivering to your customers, because agents are running in the background for the most part,” Medina tells TechCrunch. If agents do work as advertised, then they’ll be assigned increasingly more, with their growing workloads going unnoticed.
