    OpenAI returns to its open-source roots with new open-weight AI models, and it's a big deal
     
    The models are licensed under Apache 2.0, one of the most permissive open licenses. Here's what that means.

That will not please open-source AI purists, but developers worldwide are already putting the two models to the test.This change contrasts with OpenAI's approach over the past five years. The business has prioritized proprietary releases fueled by massive Microsoft investments and lucrative API deals. After all, you can't hope to become a trillion-dollar AI company without maximizing your profits. On the other hand, open source has consistently demonstrated that when code is developed openly, everyone, including the company that releases the code, benefits. The gpt-oss-120b model targets high-p
