<p>Google has reached a settlement over a lawsuit that claimed it illegally collected data from child users without parental consent through its YouTube video platform and then sent them targeted ads. The tech giant will shell out $30 million to settle the proposed class-action suit. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-settles-youtube-childrens-privacy-lawsuit-2025-08-19/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers said there could be 35 million to 45 million class members. Children aged 13 or younger who watched YouTube between July 1, 2013 and April 1, 2020 could be covered. The proposed settlement was filed last night and now awaits judge approval.</p>
<p>This settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist compared to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-google-youtube-ftc-settlement-coppa.html"><ins>$170 million fine</ins></a> Google faced in 2019 following a similar suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission for alleged violations of the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act. Under the terms of that case, YouTube had agreed to stop collecting data on videos aimed at children, and both YouTube and Google were prohibited from future COPPA violations.</p>
